LP.8.1 was designated a Variant Under Monitoring by the WHO in January 2025 due to its potential to displace prior circulating variants. Informed by early growth modeling and antigenic analysis, we selected LP.8.1 as a candidate strain for the 2025-2026 vaccine season. Here, we describe the development of updated LP.8.1-matched mRNA vaccine compositions encoding either the full-length spike protein for mRNA-1273 (monovalent) or the membrane-anchored receptor-binding and N-terminal domains for the mRNA-1283 vaccine. Initial in vitro characterization, including structural analysis, demonstrated robust antigen expression and intact antigenic features. Immunogenicity of both vaccines were evaluated in murine models following immunization as either a primary series in naive animals or as a booster dose. LP.8.1-matched vaccines elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against the homologous LP.8.1 strain and more recently emerging JN.1-lineage subvariants, including XFG and NB.1.8.1. Notably, the mRNA-1283 vaccine expressing LP.8.1 induced higher mean neutralization titers than the mRNA-1273 version across multiple variants. These data demonstrate the immunogenicity and breadth of both LP.8.1-based mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1283 vaccines in the context of ongoing JN.1 lineage evolution and support the selection of LP.8.1 as the updated vaccine antigen for the 2025-2026 season.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

In contrast, using within-family variation in DNA sharing is robust to most confounding factors including shared environmental effects and population stratification. Yet, accurate estimates for most traits are not available using this design, and none for non-European ancestry populations. Here, we analyse approximately 500,000 sibling pairs with diverse ancestries and obtain robust and precise heritability estimates for 14 phenotypes, including two well-studied model traits (height and BMI), five behavioural phenotypes and two common diseases. We find substantial heritability for smoking initiation (0.34, standard error (s.e.) 0.05), alcohol consumption (0.18, s.e. 0.04), number of children (0.27, s.e. 0.11) and personality (""talk versus listen"", 0.48, s.e. 0.13). In addition, we estimated large heritability for two common diseases, type 2 diabetes (T2D: 0.43, s.e. 0.06) and asthma (0.34, s.e. 0.06), whose risk factors include behavioural traits. Overall, we show concordant estimates across ancestry groups and highlight a significant contribution of shared environmental effects for behaviour and T2D risk, which may have inflated between-family estimates. Altogether, our results demonstrate that substantial genetic variation underlies complex traits, common disease and exposures, that estimates are concordant across ancestries and that they are larger than has been accounted for by GWAS to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758319740259

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche M√©dicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""F√©d√©ration pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 ‚ÄúEspoir en t√™te‚Äù 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction.

Using this approach, we screened over 1,750 opsins from a range of families. We discovered that the F240A mutation of the light-gated potassium channel WiChR abolished potassium selectivity, turning it into a sensitive excitatory channel that we dubbed ""WAChR"". We systematically mutated WAChR and identified variants that expand the frontier of speed-sensitivity tradeoffs. Multiple WAChR variants produced large inward currents in response to indoor ambient office light, and responded to irradiances as low as 15 nW/mm2, something that we did not observe with other ultra-sensitive opsins. In vivo recording from the mouse cortex confirmed that WAChRs exhibit enhanced sensitivity in neurons.

To this end, large-scale CRISPR screens have been conducted to perturb thousands of candidate enhancers. Using these data, predictive models have been developed that aim to generalize such findings to predict which enhancers regulate which genes across the genome. However, existing CRISPR methods and large-scale datasets have limitations in power, scale, or selection bias, with the potential to skew our understanding of the properties of distal regulatory elements and confound our ability to evaluate predictive models. Here, we develop a new framework for highly powered, unbiased CRISPR screens, including an optimized experimental method (Direct-Capture Targeted Perturb-seq (DC-TAP-seq)), a random design strategy, and a comprehensive analytical pipeline that accounts for statistical power. We applied this framework to survey 1,425 randomly selected candidate regulatory elements across two human cell lines. Our results reveal fundamental properties of distal regulatory elements in the human genome. Most element-gene regulatory interactions are estimated to have small effect sizes (<10%), which previous experiments were not powered to detect. Most cis-regulatory interactions occur over short genomic distances (<100 kb). A large fraction of the discovered regulatory elements bind CTCF but do not show chromatin marks typical of classical enhancers. Housekeeping genes have similar frequencies of distal regulatory elements compared to other genes, but with 2-fold weaker effect sizes. Comparisons to the predictions of the ENCODE-rE2G model suggest that, while performance is similar across two cell types, new models will be needed to detect elements with weaker effect sizes, regulatory effects of CTCF sites, and enhancers for housekeeping genes. Overall, this study describes the first unbiased, perturbation-based survey of thousands of distal regulatory element-gene connections, and provides a framework for expanding such efforts to build more complete maps of distal regulation in the human genome.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21SA0072102;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation on Consortium"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UM1HG011972;""},{""name"":""NHLBI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL159176;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35HG011324;""},{""name"":""NSF Graduate Research Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-1656518;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG011664;""},{""name"":""AHA Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""821920 and 23POSTCHF1019753;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2113072 and NSF DMS-2310654.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

VirScan revealed unique viral exposure histories for each individual. At the antibody level, we observed strong protein-level immunodominance, with viral surface proteins consistently recognized across individuals, but striking variability at the epitope level, even within immunodominant proteins. At the functional level, differential protein expression analysis showed that prior infection with HSV-1, HSV-2, or norovirus was associated with elevated production of CCL4, MCP-2, and TNF, respectively, following TLR7/8 stimulation, indicating virus-specific imprints on innate immune responses. Together, these findings suggest that both chronic and acute viral infections are major drivers of immune variation and can leave lasting signatures on innate function.

However, it remains unclear how the nutrients released during cell lysis affect the growth dynamics of the remaining bacterial population. Addressing this gap, we built a controlled system consisting of two Escherichia coli lysogenic strains: one carrying a wild-type {lambda} prophage and the other a temperature-inducible variant that can be induced to lyse at 38 {degrees}C. Using this system, we selectively induced phage lysis in a defined fraction of the population and quantified both total biomass and the biomass of surviving, non-lysed cells. We observed that the biomass loss was consistently smaller than expected based on the fraction of lysed cells, supporting the idea that some of the released biomass is rapidly recycled by the non-lysed population. To formalize the observed dynamics and obtain quantitative insight, we developed a mathematical model showing that nutrients released during lysis can transiently enhance the growth rate of the surviving, non-lysed cells. This effect emerges on a short timescale of minutes, consistent with the rapid onset of biomass compensation observed experimentally. The growth rate increase was confirmed in single-cell experiments using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, where we cultured wild-type lysogens in lysate-containing culture supernatants. In summary, the results suggest that nutrients released through lysis are rapidly consumed, leading to an acceleration in the growth rate of non-lysed cells.

However, explaining how these insular subregions interact to support behaviors is elusive. Using direct recordings from humans performing a spatial episodic memory task, we show that traveling waves within the insula modulate neuronal interactions across insula subregions, by propagating in distinct spatial patterns during specific phases of memory. In addition to traveling plane waves, insula waves also propagated in complex, heterogenous spatial patterns across task conditions. Insular traveling waves correlated with memory success, highlighting the critical role of insular traveling waves in orchestrating memory performance. Our study suggests that insular traveling waves are a key mechanism for modulating interactions and neural coding across regions to support memory processing and potentially a biomarker for investigating dysfunctions in neurological disorders.","[{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2309174;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

Understanding the evolutionary history of virulence elements requires genomes sampled in commensalism in healthy hosts, as genomes from bacterial infections are biased towards higher pathogenicity. Here, using a rare collection of human commensal Escherichia coli sampled in France from 1980 to 2020, we inferred the evolutionary history of the High Pathogenicity Island (HPI), a key virulence factor of E. coli with an uncertain evolutionary origin. We showed that the HPI was horizontally transferred from Yersinia pestis to E. coli and other Enterobacterales approximatively 4,800 years ago, coinciding with a period of high prevalence of the plague in the Neolithic. The element subsequently spread in the whole species and in Klebsiella pneumoniae, with signs of positive epistasis with phylogroups B2 and F, and was positively selected in the last 100 years. Our work sheds light on the history and mode of evolution of virulence in an important opportunistic pathogen. It suggests the Neolithic period may have favored not only the emergence of zoonotic pathogens but also gene transfer between bacterial species, enriching the gene repertoire of major pathogens with potentially important implications on public health nowadays.","[{""name"":""CNRS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Momemtum;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

WGD is sensed indirectly due to the presence of extra centrosomes, which activate the PIDDosome to induce a p53-dependent G1-arrest. Here we uncouple WGD from centrosome amplification and show that p53 still arrests tetraploid cells, but via the mitotic stopwatch; a p53/53BP1/USP28-dependent pathway that causes G1-arrest following an extended mitotic delay. Mitotic timing is unaffected by WGD, but the threshold mitotic delay needed to invoke a G1-arrest is reduced. This sensitivity to the stopwatch mechanism is not associated with altered levels of mitotic stopwatch components, but instead, is associated with enhanced p21 concentrations prior to mitosis. Similar effects are observed in diploid cells treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors to double their size, implicating G1 delays and cell size as key determinants of stopwatch sensitivity. This ability of the mitotic stopwatch to arrest proliferation after increases to genome or cell size has important implications for the progression and treatment of cancer. It also demonstrates that the stopwatch pathway can sense more than just mitotic delays.","[{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C4730/A21229;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""222494/Z/21/Z;""},{""name"":""Tenovus Scotland"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037866t57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T22-23;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

To identify the developmental mechanism linking maternal obesity to cardiometabolic disease in the offspring, a high fat/high fructose diet or low-fat control diet were introduced 4 weeks prior to mating in C57BL6 females and continued throughout pregnancy and lactation. Offspring born to obese dams had greater whole-body adiposity prior to puberty and were more susceptible to diet-induced obesity in adulthood. On postnatal day 10 (PND10) when pups born to obese dams had greater accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue, single cell sequencing was used to identify adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in the stromal vascular fraction. Two distinct lineages of APCs were identified that arose from a common proliferative root, terminating in committed preadipocytes and anti-adipogenic APCs. In pups born to obese dams, the proliferative root made up a greater proportion of APCs, more of these cells were in the G2M and S phases of the cell cycle and there was an enrichment in genes associated with proliferation (mKi67, Fat3, Ccn4, Gata4). On PND10, APCs isolated from the inguinal depots of pups born to obese dams were hyper-proliferative and there was a greater abundance of total APCs, whereas there were no differences in adipocyte size. After puberty, APCs in subcutaneous depots of offspring born to obese dams were more adipogenic in vitro and this group gained a greater amount of body fat in response to pharmacological stimulation of adipogenesis by rosiglitazone. Male adults born to obese dams had a lower abundance of APCs and were more susceptible to APC exhaustion due to prolonged exposure to rosiglitazone. Therefore, early onset obesity in offspring exposed to maternal obesity in utero is due to a prolongation of the proliferative phase of early life adipogenesis, leading to a higher adipocyte number.","[{""name"":""Canadian Institutes of Health Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gavpb45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PJT - 162452;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN105216-2023;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

However, the performance of these models has generally been poor. One possible reason is that they are typically trained to predict aggregate scores of several depression symptoms; by contrast, individual symptoms may behave differently, be more predictable and/or more responsive to treatment. We tested this possibility by comparing the performance of machine learning models for predicting early response to psychotherapy based on 21 different outcome measures: (i) 16 individual depression symptoms, (ii) 4 latent symptom factors for sleep, appetite, motivation, and negative affect related symptoms, and (iii) total scores based on the widely used Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS). We used a large real-world dataset of 85 baseline features spanning sociodemographic, cognitive, clinical, lifestyle and physical health assessments in patients (N=776) initiating internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT). For all 21 outcome measures, we developed elastic net models (N=543) and validated their performance in an unseen hold-out sample (N=233). In the hold-out dataset the model predicting total depression scores achieved an R-squared of 40% variance explained, while there was substantial variability in model performance for individual symptoms (R-squared :2.1%-44%) and latent symptom factors (R-squared :26%-44%). Model comparisons revealed that most individual symptom and latent factor models with all 85 predictors were not superior to simpler benchmark models comprising only age, sex and baseline levels of the respective depression outcome measure. The benchmark was outperformed by models predicting total scores (R-squared delta=0.54, p=0.039), sad mood (R-squared delta=0.106, p<0.001), loss of interest (R-squared delta=0.079, p=0.017) and a latent factor representing negative affect and thought (R-squared delta=0.054, p=0.035). Specifically, these models benefitted from additional predictors, such as treatment expectation, suicidal ideation, social support, or functional impairment. Our predictive modelling approach suggests new avenues towards a more patient-centred precision psychiatry, by providing clinicians with individual-level prognoses and predictors for interventions at the symptom level.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758319740259

Although limited zoonotic cases have resulted from the current epizootic outbreak, the wide diversity of influenza viruses in avian hosts means the emergence of new strains that could transmit to humans more readily cannot be ruled out. There is therefore a need to anticipate zoonotic potential before spillover occurs.

Here, we develop a novel zoonotic prediction model for avian influenza viruses, building upon ""host-predictor"" machine learning methods that estimate host potential given only a viral genome sequence. We construct a machine learning framework combining individual sub-models of influenza genome segments, each trained on many genomic and proteomic traits (e.g., k-mer composition, codon biases, protein physicochemistry).

To prevent over-fitting to heavily sampled lineages and ensure models generalise to phylogenetically distant viruses, we pre-process training data by considering clusters of shared sequence identity. Curated training sets cover [~]4,000 representative, complete genome sequences of avian influenza from 120 subtypes including 9 containing known zoonotic viruses.

We combine best-performing models into a single ensemble that can distinguish zoonotic capability of sequences held out from training with strong performance (AUROC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.90), including sequences of rarely-sampled subtypes, e.g., H10N8. Interrogating ensemble model decisions also allows us to identify influential genomic motifs most associated with human infection.

These findings suggest specific genomic traits that are key to understanding and monitoring evolution of influenza viruses that circulate within bird populations. Our ensemble model can estimate zoonotic potential for new sequence inputs, offering a means to quickly risk-assess emerging avian influenza strains as soon as a sequence becomes available.","[{""name"":""Seqirus (United Kingdom)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022 ‚Äì 2027 Framework Research Collaboration Agreement Influenza Research Partnership collaboration plan 002;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

Nucleosome remodeling complexes hydrolyze ATP to translocate DNA and thereby mobilize histone proteins. While nucleosome remodeling complexes have been extensively studied for their roles in regulating nucleosome positioning and accessibility, their contributions to higher-order chromatin architecture remain less well understood. Here, we investigate the roles of two key nucleosome remodelers, esBAF and INO80C, in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using Hi-C, we find that loss of either remodeler has minimal effects on global compartment or TAD structures. In contrast, subcompartment organization is notably altered, suggesting that esBAF and INO80C contribute to finer-scale chromatin topology. To overcome the limited resolution of Hi-C for detecting regulatory loops, we employed promoter capture Micro-C (PCMC), which revealed that the loss of esBAF or INO80C alters a subset of promoter anchored looping interactions. Although these changes occur at distinct genomic loci for each remodeler, the affected sites are commonly enriched for bivalent chromatin regions bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (OSN), as well as BRG1 and INO80 themselves. Together, our findings reveal that esBAF and INO80C selectively influence subcompartment identity and enhancer-promoter communication at key regulatory loci, highlighting a previously underappreciated role for nucleosome remodelers in higher-order chromatin organization.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 GM133732;HD072122;HG003143;DK107980;HG011536;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

While mechanobiology has primarily focused on factors such as cell-generated contractility and mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), a novel mechanobiological paradigm highlights the role of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping epithelial tissues. In our study, we developed an in vitro model of cell coated micro-sized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) which allows to decipher the interplay between cellular activities and tissue mechanics. Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of fluid transport in generating mechanical forces within epithelial tissues. Supported by a theoretical mechano-hydraulic model, a mechanistic framework for understanding the intricate interplay between cellular processes and tissue mechanics was established. These results challenge traditional views of epithelial tissue mechanics, emphasizing the pivotal influence of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping tissues. We anticipate that this study will advance the understanding of epithelial tissue development, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying pathological conditions.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Adv-101019835;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0071;DFG-ANR-22-CE92-0048;ANR-10-INBS-04;""},{""name"":""Institut National Du Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03m8vkq32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INCa_16712;INCa_18429;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Alexander von Humboldt Professorship;""},{""name"":""La Ligue Contre le Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rkrv905"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Equipe labellisee 2029;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

Despite forays into the description and quantification of these punctuated events, the effects of such events on subsequent cancer evolution remain incompletely understood. Here we investigate how non-gradual mutagenesis affects the ability of tumor cells to acquire and retain fitness-enhancing adaptations. We find that punctuated mutagenesis significantly facilitates adaptation in scenarios where adaptation requires crossing a fitness valley, i.e. when multiple mutations are required which individually are maladaptive but jointly confer a fitness advantage. By increasing the probability that multiple mutations occur in close succession, punctuation increases the chance that mutants in a fitness valley mutate further to reach a fitness peak before going extinct. Analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we find that tumors with signatures of APOBEC mutagenesis, which has been shown to proceed in episodic bursts, exhibit patterns consistent with higher rates of crossing fitness valleys. Lastly, we characterize how the interplay between this enhanced ability to cross fitness valleys and adaptation-limiting effects of clonal interference affects overall adaptability in complex fitness landscapes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

This plant pathogen naturally infects tree tomato (Solanum betaceum) but has not been reported on tomatoes and potatoes, the primary hosts of P. infestans. The aim of this study was to characterize the infection cycle of P. betacei using microscopy and molecular approaches. Several strains were inoculated in susceptible tree tomato plants and disease progression was monitored via six epidemiological parameters. Although different P. betacei strains displayed a highly variable disease phenotype, the most aggressive one was chosen for further plant inoculations. Samples at different time points of the infection cycle were analyzed at the cellular level via light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and at the molecular level via qRT-PCR of infection-stage-specific markers. The infection cycle of P. betacei differed from that of P. infestans in having a longer biotrophic stage, larger lesions, and higher sporulation capacity. Additionally, P. betacei transcriptomic profiles were monitored along the infection cycle via RNAseq and evidenced a changing expression landscape that supports an elongated hemibiotrophic transition and a clear distinction from what is being expressed in the mycelium or the sporangia. This study provides novel insights into the interaction between P. betacei and S. betaceum.","[{""name"":""The Royal Society International Exchanges Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2016/R2 Ref.

However, the robustness of this control strategy across the wide genetic diversity of DENV remains unknown. Here, we systematically tested two commonly used Wolbachia strains (wAlbB and wMelM) for their ability to inhibit 60 genetically diverse DENV isolates spanning all four serotypes. We found stronger inhibition by wMelM (median relative dissemination: 0.04) than wAlbB (median relative dissemination: 0.19). Furthermore, while we found substantial heterogeneity in inhibition across DENV isolates, we found that more DENV-3 isolates were weakly inhibited (median relative dissemination: 0.47 for wAlbB and 0.39 for wMelM) compared to the other serotypes (median relative disseminations: 0.10-0.18 for wAlbB and 0-0.11 for wMelM). Using transmission dynamic models, we further showed that differential Wolbachia inhibition results in increased probability of reemergence, particularly in high transmission intensity settings, with strong selection for DENV strains that have higher relative dissemination in mosquitoes. Our work highlights the importance of considering DENV genetic diversity, including the long-term risk of selection, in Wolbachia-based control interventions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

In this study, we leveraged high-quality, long-read genome assemblies from 26 maize inbreds to investigate natural selection on TEs. We developed a novel and interpretable method, {Phi}SFS, which incorporates TE age and improves resolution for detecting selection.

This work represents the first application of long-read genome assemblies to study TE selection in a major crop species with a typical plant genome size.

To address this, we tested the impact of decreased intrinsic nucleosome stability across multiple cell, tissue and organismal models by introducing histone mutants that weaken histone/histone interactions. While nucleosome instability did not broadly alter global chromatin accessibility, DNA damage, cell proliferation or viability, it impaired lineage-specific gene expression programs, altered lineage specification and activated intrinsic inflammatory and stress pathways in a manner reminiscent of aging in mouse tissues and human cells. Consistently, nucleosome instability accelerated the onset of age-associated transcriptional alterations and functional decline in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, and reduced cellular resilience to exogenous perturbations, including environmental, epigenetic and mitotic stress in human cells and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These cross-species findings identify nucleosome stability as an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic safeguard that preserves cell identity and stress resilience and supports organismal function and healthy aging.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching.

However, how a neuron utilises multiple, simultaneously expressed channel proteins - connexins or innexins -to make meaningful connections with distinct synaptic partners remains largely unknown. Using the posterior mechanosensory circuit in C. elegans, we discovered that individual electrical synapses can be formed by clustering together molecularly distinct gap junction channel-types made of three different innexin proteins, INX-1, UNC-7, and UNC-9. In this previously unknown configuration, which we term as heterochannel synapses, molecularly distinct gap junction channel types functionally collaborate to regulate posterior touch sensory behaviour, enhancing functional robustness. We show that the synaptic trafficking of the molecularly different channel types within a heterochannel synapse is independently regulated by discrete and conserved kinesin motor proteins, while distinct molecular pathways involving channel-specific retrograde kinesins regulate their turnover. These independent, channel-specific regulations also make individual synapse-level alterations in the composition of heterochannel synapses possible under altered environmental conditions, providing a novel mechanism for electrical synapse plasticity. Finally, we present evidence of heterochannel electrical synapses in C. elegans locomotory circuits and in the cerebellar Purkinje neurons of zebrafish larvae.

While mechanistic investigations have uncovered many facets of GATA1 biology, how GATA1 co-regulates divergent cell fates remains only partially characterized. We previously described that loss of Stag2, a member of the cohesin complex and a recurrent mutational target in myelodysplastic syndrome and Down Syndrome associated acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, results in altered chromatin accessibility, transcription factor function, and cell differentiation. Hence, we hypothesized that chromatin accessibility facilitates lineage specificity of GATA1, thereby permitting efficient cellular differentiation. To understand the connection between chromatin accessibility and GATA1, we performed comprehensive studies of erythropoiesis in Stag2{triangleup} mice. Defects in Stag2-deficient hematopoiesis included reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors (EryPs), impaired terminal erythroid maturation, increased number of MkPs, and increased megakaryocytes. RNA- and ATAC-sequencing of EryPs revealed altered patterns of Gata1 target gene expression with altered accessibility in conjunction with loss of expression of erythroid targets and gain of megakaryocyte targets. Gata1 occupancy was lost at erythroid targets, while occupancy increased at megakaryocyte targets. Functionally, we observed that Stag2-deficient EryPs have diminished erythroid output and augmented megakaryocyte output in orthogonal differentiation assays. Human models and primary MDS patients recapitulated the essential phenotypic and molecular features of our in vivo murine MDS model. Collectively, this study advances the understanding of the interplay between TF function and chromatin accessibility.

These sensors share the key mechanism of editing a stop codon opposite a specific sequence motif in the target transcript, where this motif requirement is dictated by ADAR's strong sequence preference. This constrains sensor design and precludes the sensing of short sequences that lack such motifs, often essential for key applications such as sensing viral RNAs and differentiating splice isoforms. Here we address this limitation with modular RNA sensors using adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (""modulADAR""). ModulADAR features two key elements that mirror the modularity of ADARs: regions that hybridize with the target transcript to recruit ADAR's dsRNA-binding domains, and a stem-loop for stop-codon editing by ADAR's catalytic domain. We optimize modulADAR and apply it to detect short subsequences that cannot be sensed by prior-generation sensors. We anticipate that modulADAR will empower broader basic science and therapeutic applications, especially those that will uniquely benefit from programmable RNA detection in living cells.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21EB033858;DP2EB035891;R01AI173189;""},{""name"":""Longevity Impetus Grants"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford Cancer Institute innovative award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford Bio-X Interdisciplinary Initiatives seed grant program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R11-6;""},{""name"":""Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute seed grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford ChEM-H CBI training program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EDGE Doctoral Fellowship Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford Bio-X Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

Hrp1 binds (UA)n repeats found in both mRNA 3'-UTRs and short noncoding RNA terminators, but its function in 3'-end formation is not fully understood. Our past microarray transcriptome analysis of the heat-sensitive hrp1-7 allele suggested Hrp1 functions in antitermination of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) on protein-coding genes. The hrp1-7 allele has four substitutions and one, M191T, was shown to be primarily responsible for NNS terminator readthrough. Here we show that Hrp1-7 protein has a four-fold and Hrp1-M191T a two-fold decreased affinity for (UA)5 in vitro. We used nanopore direct RNA sequencing to assess the transcriptome-wide effects of hrp1-7 and hrp1-M191T, which identified new examples of Hrp1-dependent small nucleolar RNA terminators and mRNA attenuators (regulatory terminators in the 5'-UTR and ORF). For some genes, including HRP1, attenuated transcript reads outnumber the corresponding mRNA reads in exponentially growing wild-type cells. We also observed widespread changes in mRNA polyA site selection. In the hrp1-M191T strain the polyA site shifts are mostly downstream, while in the hrp1-7 strain upstream and downstream shifts are more similar in frequency. Our results are consistent with a model in which some of the four substitutions in hrp1-7 weaken the affinity of Hrp1 for the RNAP II elongation complex, while others interfere with its recognition of specific sequences in nascent transcripts that would normally promote its release from the elongation complex.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 GM118075;S10 RR13790;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BIR-9512577;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740259

As access to human cortical tissue is sparse, cerebral organoids (COs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells have emerged as a promising in vitro model for studying the human cortex. Astrocyte subtypes unique to humans are recapitulated in COs but have not been quantitatively assessed (1, 2). In this study, we characterized human astrocytes in situ in sliced COs cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI-COs). By 4 months of age, ALI-COs express many mature astrocyte markers and showed increasing levels of GFAP with longer culture durations. By employing immunostaining, tissue clearing, morphological reconstruction, and unsupervised clustering analysis, three major GFAP+ astrocyte subtypes were identified in ALI-COs. All subtypes exhibited greater morphological complexity than their mouse counterparts, as revealed by increased branching and longer branch extensions. However, consistent with the mid-gestation fetal stage of the ALI-COs, astrocytes did not fully recapitulate the complexity observed in adult human astrocytes, which are known to continue maturation postnatally.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2015-043;""},{""name"":""Brain Canada Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bcmwk98"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

This heterogeneity is reflected by differential gene expression activity at various spatial location. Spatial transcriptomics technologies record genome-wide measurements of gene expression at the scale of entire tissues with high spatial resolution. While they have revolutionized our quantitative understanding of tissue architecture, these technologies generate large and high dimensional datasets encompassing tens of thousands of genes recorded at tens of thousands of spatial locations, requiring efficient automated methods for their analysis. In this study we introduce joint spatial PCA (jsPCA), a novel, fast, scalable and interpretable method for the automatic identification of spatial domains and variable genes in multi-slice and multi-sample spatial transcriptomics data. jsPCA relies on a simple mathematical formulation of a spatial covariance defined as the product of the gene expression covariance with the spatial autocorrelation. The principal components of this spatial covariance yield a biologically meaningful low-dimensional representation. From this representation, we can derive spatial domains by simple clustering. In addition, spatially variable genes can be identified directly from the principal components coefficients. Moreover, this approach enables the joint representation of multiple slices and samples, a frequent experimental setting. This joint representation is obtained without spatial alignment by computing common principal components via joint diagonalization of the set of spatial covariance matrices obtained for each slice. By leveraging sparsity and non-convex optimization on manifold, jsPCA leads to computing time in the order of seconds to minutes, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. We benchmarked jsPCA on the Visium 10x dataset of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the Stereo-seq MOSTA dataset of mouse embryonic development against 10 state-of-the-art methods. Our approach demonstrated excellent performances, comparable or better than state-of-the-art methods, such as SpatialPCA, BASS, GraphPCA or Stagate, while being much faster, interpretable, and scalable to very large datasets.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-CPJ12022-VILLOUTREIX-U125;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

Long handles further complicate measurements by convolving target conformational changes with handle stretching. We introduce Tether Force Spectroscopy (TFS), a bead-free SMFS platform where a single DNA tether acts as both the force applicator and internal calibrator. In TFS, shear flow acting on identical DNA tethers applies piconewton-scale forces directly to surface-anchored molecules whose conformational dynamics are simultaneously monitored by single-molecule fluorescence. This guarantees single-tether results with uniform, internally calibrated forces and is inherently compatible with single-molecule fluorescence. We achieved high-resolution, high-throughput measurements across hundreds of molecules, enabling both force-extension and rupture experiments without specialized instrumentation. The combination of simplicity and simultaneous force-fluorescence capability makes TFS broadly accessible for correlating structure and function in diverse biomolecular systems.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2024-04352;RGPIN-2017-04407;""},{""name"":""Canada Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0517h6h17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRC-2020-00143;""},{""name"":""Canada Foundation for Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000az4664"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""35492;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

A major challenge during outbreaks is not only detecting antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), but also unmasking their pathogen hosts and genomic context, as ARGs alone do not fully capture AMR risk. Pathogen identification is often essential for guiding effective treatment. While culture-based methods remain the diagnostic gold standard, they are slow and sometimes impractical. Faster metagenomic (mNGS) tools typically detect either ARGs, taxonomy, or genomic context, but rarely all three, resulting in fragmented surveillance. Existing k-mer classifiers like Kraken2 and CLARK, designed for general taxonomy, often perform poorly on AMR-specific sequences. We introduce CARD k-mers, the first tool built to jointly predict species-level taxonomy and genomic context (plasmid vs. chromosome) for ARGs in short metagenomic reads. Integrated with the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), CARD k-mers enables rapid, context-aware assignment of ARGs to their likely pathogen and genomic element origin. In benchmarking with 103,456 in-silico pathogen-specific AMR alleles, CARD k-mers outperformed Kraken2 and CLARK by 10.85% and 15.2%, respectively, and correctly classified the genomic context of 4,590 chromosome- and 176 plasmid-specific ARGs. The tool operates at speeds exceeding 675,000 metagenomic reads per minute. By delivering fast, accurate, and context-rich classification of ARGs, CARD k-mers significantly advances untargeted AMR surveillance and is accessible to users with basic command-line experience for use in both clinical and environmental pipelines.

While this bias is thought to reflect a right-hemisphere dominance when allocating spatial attention, the contribution of subcortical structures remains poorly understood. Although lesion and neuroimaging studies in clinical populations have implicated asymmetries in the basal ganglia and thalamus to dysfunction in spatial attention, it remains unclear whether naturally occurring subcortical asymmetries in healthy individuals predict behavioural biases in spatial attention. In this study, we investigated whether volumetric asymmetries in subcortical structures are associated with biases in spatial attention in a non-clinical population. This was achieved by using the landmark task to assess spatial biases, alongside acquiring T1-weighted MRI data from 44 healthy participants. The subcortical regions were segmented using the FIRST algorithm to estimate the volumetric asymmetry of specific regions. We found that variability in pseudoneglect was predicted by the degree of leftward lateralisation of putamen volume, indicating that the putamen contributes to the magnitude of spatial attention biases. This also suggests that the left putamen may support right-hemisphere neocortical dominance through the indirect pathway. These findings bridge anatomical and behavioural measures, highlighting the functional relevance of subcortical asymmetry in shaping attentional processes in the healthy brain. Our findings pave the way for early diagnosis of neurological disorders associated with subcortical atrophies including Parkinson's Disease and dementia.","[{""name"":""NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR203316;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""227420;203139/Z/16/Z;581203139/A/16/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) represent a promising solution to enhance risk stratification in intermediate-risk groups by identifying individuals with high genetic risk; however, observed differences in performance across ancestry groups may cause health disparities. The emerging field of algorithmic fairness offers a principled framework to assess equity in model performance among relevant subgroups, but have rarely been applied to clinical risk tools and PRS. Objectives: To evaluate the fairness of incorporating PRS in CVD risk prediction, both as a standalone risk factor and as a risk-enhancing factor for individuals at intermediate risk (recommended in current clinical consensus statements). Methods: Using data from the UK Biobank (N = 327,923), we calculated 10-year CVD risk using QRISK3 (a guideline-endorsed prediction model) and quantified genetic risk using a validated PRS. We assessed fairness among population characteristics relevant for health equity (age, sex, ethnicity, and area-level deprivation) using four algorithmic fairness metrics relevant for prevention (accuracy equality, equal opportunity, conditional use accuracy equality, and treatment equality). Results: PRS, when used as a stand-alone risk factor, demonstrated fairness levels similar to or better than traditional clinical predictors (age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol). Some variation in fairness was observed across ethnic groups, especially at extreme risk thresholds. When integrated as a risk-enhancing factor for reclassifying intermediate-risk individuals into high-risk categories, PRS improved sensitivity of CVD risk prediction with minimal impact on fairness metrics across demographic groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that PRS, when incorporated into existing risk prediction frameworks, are unlikely to meaningfully exacerbate disparities in CVD risk stratification. Applying algorithmic fairness metrics provides insight into the equitable implementation of PRS and supports current recommendations for their use in risk-stratification for intermediate-risk individuals.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758319740260

However, the performance for folded RNA structures was not specifically explored. In this study, we present a benchmark of the OPC water model on three different RNAs with highly intricate tertiary structures - the ribosomal L1 stalk RNA-protein protuberance, the mini tetraloop-tetraloop receptor (miniTTR-6) folded RNA, and the GAAA tetraloop-tetraloop receptor homodimer.

For all three systems, we observe large-scale unfolding of the RNA, and even loss of the L1 stalk protein-RNA interface, when simulated with the OPC. In contrast, the simulations are entirely stable with the three-point water models. The underlying cause seems to be the higher affinity of the OPC waters to H-bond donor and acceptor groups of the RNA, disrupting the native solute-solute interactions. An identical issue can be observed also for the similar and widely used TIP4PD water model combined with the DES-Amber RNA FF. Our findings suggest that caution is warranted when using the four-point OPC and TIP4PD water models for simulations of structured RNAs.

Using double-serial retrocuing (DSR) with simultaneous EEG recording, we investigated how single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to right intraparietal sulcus impacts neural representations of unprioritized memory items (UMI), relative to irrelevant memory items (IMI) that are no longer needed for the trial. Twelve human participants (8 female) performed DSR plus a single-retrocue task, while spTMS was delivered during delay periods. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that spTMS restored decodability of the UMI concurrent with stimulation, and that of the IMI several timesteps later, after the evoked effects of spTMS were no longer present in the EEG signal. This effect was carried by the alpha and low-beta frequency bands. Analyses of the EEG showed two effects selective to the UMI: both the retrocue designating the UMI and spTMS produced phase shifts in the low-beta band. These results were mirrored by representational geometry analyses, which revealed larger cue-related and spTMS-related rotations of the UMI-representing subspace, compared to the prioritized subspace spTMS. These findings demonstrate that deprioritization involves active neural mechanisms distinct from the processing of the IMI, and that these are supported by low-beta oscillatory dynamics in parietal cortex.

Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations. Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

Recent studies have identified a statistically significant association between long-term use of benzathine penicillin (BP) and the onset of EMAP. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. In this study, we performed an integrative in silico analysis to explore the genes modulated by BP that are expressed in ocular tissues and involved in retinal metabolic pathways. Using public databases (PubChem, GTEx, HPA, EYEDB), we identified 52 BP-responsive genes, with six (CD4, CRP, IL6, IL1R1, TAC1, TNF) directly modulated by BP and expressed in the retina. These genes are implicated in inflammation, immune response, and retinal homeostasis. Expression data show strong presence in eye and brain tissues, and several are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Network analysis revealed gene-gene and protein-protein interactions, highlighting a shared pathophysiological axis. Notably, IL6 and TNF are involved in oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and chronic inflammation-hallmarks of both EMAP and atrophic AMD. Our findings suggest that BP may induce EMAP by dysregulating retinal genes involved in neurodegeneration, providing new insights into drug safety and retinal disease mechanisms.","[{""name"":""Funda√ß√£o Arauc√°ria"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""grant #FA092016;""},{""name"":""National Council for Scientific and Technological Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03swz6y49"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""402773/2022-5;311438/2022-9;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating-type switching is a central feature of the life cycle that enables homothallism, i.e., mating between mitotic descendants of the same haploid cell. Yet heterothallic isolates that have lost this ability are found across diverse niches, indicating that this trait is polymorphic. Here we experimentally characterized loss of mating-type switching in a representative panel of strains. Analysis of 117 telomere- to-telomere genome assemblies revealed multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in the Ho endonuclease gene and structural variants in the silent HML and HMR cassettes, the three loci essential for switching. We estimated that at least 13 independent transitions from homothallism to heterothallism have occurred in the species history. Analysis of the HO genotype of 2,915 strains show that at least 27% are heterothallic. We found that heterothallism is strongly associated with polyploidy and elevated genome-wide heterozygosity, although the strength of these associations varies between populations. Heterothallic isolates are most prevalent in domesticated and clinical clades, consistent with an origin linked to human-associated environments. However, they are also found, though less frequently, in natural niches. Signatures of recombination in HO sequences suggest that outcrossing contributed to the ecological and geographical distribution of the trait. Our findings reveal that mating-type switching has undergone repeated losses in S. cerevisiae evolution, with major consequences for genome architecture and ecological diversification.

Significance StatementMating-type switching evolved multiple times in yeasts, enabling haploid selfing, which became a key feature of their life cycles. We show that this trait has been lost repeatedly in the history of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, producing heterothallic isolates that cannot switch mating type. Analysis of thousands of genomes reveals that these losses involve multiple mutations in the Ho endonuclease and structural changes in the silent mating-type cassettes. Heterothallism is associated with polyploidy and increased genome-wide heterozygosity. It is more frequent in domesticated and clinical lineages, but also occurs in natural ecological niches. Our findings illustrate how repeated changes in a single life-history trait can reshape genome architecture and highlight the dynamic interplay between genetics, environment, and evolution in a model eukaryote.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE12-0020;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants ability to update their predictions in behavior.

In addition to the YprA-like helicase, ARMADA systems share two more proteins with DISARM. However, ARMADA YprA homologs are most similar to those of Druantia, suggesting ARMADA is a  missing link connecting DISARM and Druantia. We show experimentally that ARMADA protects bacteria against a broad range of phages via a direct, non-abortive mechanism.

Here, by recording and manipulating neuronal activity along the mammillary-thalamic-cortical pathway, we show that coherence among thalamic HD cells persists even when their upstream inputs are decorrelated, particularly during non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep.

Primary sensory cortices receive topographically segregated information from first-order thalamic nuclei, which process distinct sensory modalities. In contrast, higher-order cortical regions integrate information from multiple information channels. While such hierarchical processing and integration of information is the foundation for neural computations in the mammalian cortex, the fundamental principles of thalamocortical computations in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unexplored. The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium. Collectively, our results suggest that hierarchical sensory processing across topographically organized pallial regions is a conserved functional feature of the vertebrate pallium.","[{""name"":""JSPS KAKENHI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP24K02008;""},{""name"":""European Horizon Marie-Curie individual postdoctoral fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101066743;""},{""name"":""NFR FRIPRO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""239973;314212;""},{""name"":""RCN Centres of Excellence scheme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""332640;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

While molecular screening of ChRs requires high-cost experiments, recent machine-learning-based protein functionality prediction enables more efficient selection of target proteins for characterization. Here, we constructed an elastic-net machine-learning model trained on 1,163 experimental data to predict the maximum absorption wavelength ({lambda}max) of uncharacterized ChRs.

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ChR024 in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs at resolutions of 3.22 and 2.45 [A], respectively. The structures reveal an architecture strikingly similar to that of ion-pumping rhodopsins, even more so than other pump-like channelrhodopsins such as ChRmine. Structural, theoretical, and spectroscopic analyses uncover a unique color-tuning mechanism, in which charged residues close and distant from the retinal chromophore cooperatively modulate the pKa of the Schiff base counterion and thereby determine the absorption maximum wavelength. Finally, comparative structural analysis of channel- and pump-type rhodopsins, combined with electrophysiology, provides insights into the molecular boundary between these two functional classes and demonstrates the conversion of an outward proton pump into a light-gated channel. Together, these findings illuminate diverse mechanisms of color tuning and functional specification within the rhodopsin family, paving the way for the rational engineering of next-generation optogenetic tools.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

We replicated a localized, load-dependent increase in univariate BOLD activity in parietal cortex. However, we also observed both systematic increases and decreases in univariate activity with load across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, multivariate activation patterns encoded WM load regardless of the direction of the univariate effect, arguing against a restricted locus of load signals in parietal cortex. Finally, we observed representational drift in activity patterns encoding memory load across scanning sessions. Our results suggest a distributed code for memory load that may be continually refined over time to support more efficient information storage.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EY025872;MH087214;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2104630;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

In most organisms, cilia form dense arrays of thousands of filaments that coordinate their motion into persistent, temporally synchronized patterns known as metachronal waves. Despite their ubiquity, the dynamics of these patterns and their role in tuning propulsion remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how metachronal coordination shapes the navigation of Didinium nasutum, a highly agile unicellular predator with two circumferential ciliary bands. Using high-speed imaging of freely swimming cells, we capture and quantify the dynamics of metachronal wave coordination and track their evolution across different swimming states and transitions. Combining these measurements with a hydrodynamic model, we uncover how dynamic changes in coordination directly regulate propulsion and maneuverability. We show that stable metachronal waves support persistent directed swimming, local inhomogeneities in coordination give rise to curved trajectories, and global wave reversals accommodate rapid evasion-like reorientations. Our findings reveal that transitions between coordination modes allow Didinium to access a diverse swimming repertoire, highlighting dynamic ciliary patterning as a key mechanism to encode complex microscale navigation strategies. More broadly, they provide mechanistic insights into how metachronal coordination shapes fluid flows generated by dense ciliary arrays found in unicellular protists and airway epithelia alike, ultimately influencing swimming and transport in biological systems.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project Grant 315230_215678;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UPenn MRSEC DMR- 2309043;""},{""name"":""Charles E.

Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance.

This protein complex generates a depolarizing sodium leak in various tissues and contributes to respiratory and circadian rhythms, locomotion, and sleep. De novo and inherited variants of NALCN can lead to severe developmental syndromes called  contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD) and  infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (IHPRF1), respectively. Although variants of uncertain significance (VUS) or presumed pathogenic variants have been studied in heterologous expression systems before, there is no generally accepted framework on how to assess or predict variant pathogenicity. We set out use the functional and computational characterization of 19 VUS detected in CLIFAHDD and IHPRF1 patients to establish a robust analysis to classify suspected disease-causing variants. Specifically, we employ a combination of multiple parameters derived from two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology recordings and predicted protein stability and conservation scores. We show that this approach is capable of distinguishing benign common variants from both gain- and loss-of-function (GoF/LoF) variants. Additionally, our work provides mechanistic insight into the molecular mechanism underlying specific variants and provides insight into the unusual propensity of NALCN missense variants to result in GoF phenotypes. We anticipate that this experimental and computational framework will aid assessment of variant pathogenicity of NALCN and other components of the channelosome in the future.","[{""name"":""Carlsberg Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01kpjmx04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CF16-0504;""},{""name"":""Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05svhj534"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""7025-00097A;""},{""name"":""Lundbeck Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03hz8wd80"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R252-2017-1671; SAP;R272-2017-4528; AS;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

SPNs from the direct and indirect pathways exhibited high orientation selectivity in the absence of behavioral contingencies. SPNs population activity reliably predicted different visual features. Pathway-specific silencing of SPNs revealed that high orientation selectivity depends on intra-striatal connectivity. Thus, specialized striatal modules are active participants in visual feature extraction.

At cGVHD onset, in addition to changes in the myeloid compartment, two distinct populations of CD8+T cells with a TEXEF phenotype were prevalent: an inflammatory CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_4) expressing CCL4, CD69, and TNFSF9, and an exhausted CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_5) characterized by the expression of CXCL13, HIF1A, and HLA-DRA, both correlated with clinical disease severity.

The alternative archaeal system comprises Cdv proteins and is thought to bear some resemblance to ESCRT-III-based membrane remodelling in other domains of life, including eukaryotes, especially during abscission. Here we present biochemical, crystallographic and cryo-EM studies of the Sulfolobus Cdv machinery. CdvA, an early non-ESCRT component, adopts a PRC-domain/coiled-coil fold and polymerises into long double-stranded helical filaments, mainly via hydrophobic interfaces. Monomeric CdvB adopts the canonical ESCRT-III fold in both a closed and a distinct ""semi-open"" conformation. Soluble CdvB2 filaments are composed of subunits in the closed state, appearing to transition to the open, active state only when polymerised on membranes. Short N-terminal amphipathic helices in all CdvB paralogues, B, B1 and B2, mediate membrane binding and are required for liposome recruitment in vitro. We provide a molecular overview of archaeal ESCRT-III-based cytokinesis machinery, the definitive demonstration that CdvB proteins are bona fide ESCRT-III homologues and we reveal the molecular basis for membrane engagement. Thus, we illuminate conserved principles of ESCRT-mediated membrane remodelling and extend them to an anciently diverged archaeal lineage.

Significance statementMembrane remodelling by ESCRT-III proteins is a fundamental and conserved process across the tree of life. The archaeal ESCRT-III-based cell division system (Cdv) drives cytokinesis in many archaeal groups, yet the molecular architecture of its components remained unknown, making it difficult to decipher the molecular mechanisms employed for cell division and cytokinesis in these organisms. We present structures of the Cdv machinery in Sulfolobus organisms that have been used previously to study the cell division process. We show that CdvA forms unexpected antiparallel helical filaments, while the ESCRT-III homologues retain the canonical fold we show they share with eukaryotic proteins. We demonstrate that N-terminal helices mediate membrane binding and that membrane contact, rather than polymerisation alone, likely triggers activation of Cdv ESCRT-IIIs.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U105184326;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001aqnf71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_UP_1201/27;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""227876/Z/23/Z;203276/Z/16/Z;222460/Z/21/Z;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03bsmfz84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""94933;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CIBSS ‚Äì EXC-2189 ‚Äì Project ID 390939984;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

This study investigates the transcriptional effects of music exposure in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using this non-invasive approach. To address saliva-specific limitations, we employed two complementary library preparation methods, Poly-A selection and Human-Enriched protocols, allowing us to maximize human transcript detection and ensure reproducibility. By merging them, we ensured reproducibility and captured both host and microbial signals. While each dataset individually revealed a limited number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), their integration enhanced biological resolution. Among the consistently modulated genes were HERC6, TSPAN5, and REM2, pointing to music-induced transcriptional changes relevant to neurodevelopmental and immune processes. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted pathways involved in immune regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, and epithelial differentiation. These findings align with evidence of immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered cellular communication in ASD. Importantly, co-expression network analysis identified modules significantly correlated with music exposure. Notably, the AKNA module, previously associated with ASD risk, was downregulated and enriched for Ras-related GTPase signaling and immune pathways, suggesting that music may modulate intracellular signaling and inflammation. Conversely, upregulation of the UBE2D3 module pointed to activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress response mechanisms, a known contributor to ASD neurodevelopmental deficits. These results suggest that music engages specific stress-adaptive and immunomodulatory networks in buccal cells, potentially reflecting systemic effects. Our exploratory metagenomic analysis highlights 15 microbial species with consistent abundance shifts across both methods. Notably, Acidipropionibacterium acidipropionici and Propionibacterium freudenreichii, associated with propionic acid production, emerged as music-responsive taxa. Elevated propionic acid has been implicated in ASD-like behaviors and neuroinflammation, suggesting a microbiota-mediated pathway. Music may influence both host gene expression and oral microbiota, potentially affecting neuroimmune processes via the microbiota-brain axis. Although exploratory, the results support the feasibility of using saliva for integrated molecular profiling in ASD.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

Although these datasets contain rich information on drug resistance, they are both complex and multivariate, with each isolates susceptibility measured across several antibiotics. Current analytical methods for these datasets overwhelmingly focus on genotypes, while tools to study multivariate resistance phenotypes-the direct targets of selection and clinical intervention-remain severely limited. To address this gap, we develop ""Antimicrobial Resistance Cartography"", a set of methods for interpreting high-dimensional drug resistance in large isolate collections. As a proof-of-concept, we analysed 3,628 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from the Active Bacterial Core (ABC) surveillance program, each with MICs measured for six beta-lactam antibiotics. We demonstrate how this toolkit simplifies visualisation of antibiotic resistance data across multiple drugs, resolves common issues such as missing or censored values, and identifies genetic mutations driving correlated resistance changes across multiple antibiotics. We characterise penicillin-binding protein (PBP) substitutions that increase minimum inhibitory concentration to multiple beta-lactam subclasses, revealing subtle differences in their correlated phenotypic effects, and identifying potential constraints on resistance evolution across genetic backgrounds. AMR cartography therefore provides a versatile framework for quantifying and visualising correlated resistance across antibiotics, enhancing the interpretability of complex susceptibility data for both research and public health.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

This can significantly increase the data acquisition time required to reach a desired resolution or even make it impossible to obtain a reconstruction altogether. Here, we show that preferred orientation can be overcome by continuously exciting the sample with ultrasonic waves during vitrification. Our experiments suggest that mechanical oscillations induced in the sample support continuously shake proteins loose form the air-water interface, thereby scrambling their orientations. The simple, physical nature of this mechanism should make it applicable to a wide range of proteins. Since our method can be easily implemented in existing vitrification devices, it should find widespread adoption.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

This study identified more than 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels and more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two Arabian, an Eurasian, and an African component, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T that are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758319740260

One important aspect of such networks is experience-dependent plasticity: their activity changes after repeated exposures to external and internal physiological stimuli. This kind of functional plasticity gives rise to habituation to pharmacological interventions (resulting in loss of efficacy over time), sensitization (resulting in unacceptable side effects after repeated use), or canalizing of undesired dynamics that recur even when the original problem has been resolved (persistent disease states). Our in silico analyses reveal that memories formed in gene regulatory networks can be erased by specific further experiences without any changes of network topology (leaving the connectivity in place). We present a method for discovery of stimuli that can be used to selectively delete physiological memories, which can be used to remove unwanted behaviors in biomedical and bioengineering contexts without gene therapy or genomic editing. Remarkably, not only are the training-induced gains in causal emergence not lost after stimuli that wipe memories, but we also find a positive relationship between the causal emergence and learning ability of a network, suggesting a deep asymmetry (ratchet) in the relationship between learning/forgetting and integration of collective intelligence which may have implications for evolution.

Significance StatementWe present an AI-driven method for discovering signals that can be used to induce physiological networks to forget specific behaviors, which can be used for applications in biomedicine and bioengineering.","[{""name"":""John Templeton Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/035tnyy05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Templeton World Charity Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00x0z1472"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Astonishing Labs"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758319740260

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758319740260
