However, our understanding of how this Pan-African metapopulation would have changed through time is still limited. Further, the drivers of such changes are uncertain, and quantitative models of the respective contribution of different African regions are lacking. Here we provide a complete reconstruction of the meta-population dynamics over the last 200,000 years by quantitatively integrating an environmental niche model based on archaeological sites within a spatially explicit population genetic framework. The inferred metapopulation dynamics not only fully explains the divergence among all available contemporary and ancient genomes of African hunter-gatherers, which were used to calibrate the model, but also accurately predicts the patterns of craniometric diversification across the continent from the Middle Pleistocene to the present. Furthermore, we show how the climate-driven changes in population sizes and connectivity predict major patterns of archaeological and phenotypic diversification over the last 200,000 years across the African continent.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Expanding this space to include noncanonical amino acids (NCAAs) offers new opportunities for probing novel interactions and engineering proteins with enhanced or entirely new functions. Some NCAAs also offer practical advantages, such as increased proteolytic stability and reduced immunogenicity, as they are rarely encountered by the human immune system. Here, we present RareFold, a deep learning model capable of accurate structure prediction for proteins containing both the 20 canonical amino acids and an additional 29 NCAAs. By treating each amino acid as a distinct token, RareFold learns residue-specific atomic interaction patterns, enabling precise modelling of chemically diverse sequences. This tokenised representation also supports sequence-structure co-optimisation, allowing efficient inverse design. We leverage this capability in EvoBindRare, a design framework for generating linear and cyclic peptide binders that incorporate NCAAs. Applying EvoBindRare, we design binders targeting a ribonuclease and experimentally validate these, obtaining M affinity in both the linear and cyclic cases. RareFold thus enables binder design with an expanded chemical vocabulary, opening the door to next-generation peptide therapeutics with improved stability, specificity, and immune evasion.

Upon activation, DCs undergo changes in their transcriptome, phenotype, and function, depending on the tissue microenvironment. The role of DC activation during human chronic inflammation has yet to be explored. To address this, we aimed to investigate activated DCs across a range of chronically inflamed human tissues, with a focus on cervical lymph nodes (LNs). We performed scRNAseq and flow cytometry on healthy, acutely, chronically inflamed, and cancer-associated human cervical (LNs) and identified a novel inflammation-associated DC (iaDC) cell state, found only within chronically inflamed LNs. iaDCs were defined by a unique cytokine expression profile (CXCL9, CXCL10, IL1B) and could be phenotypically distinguished from other activated DCs by their elevated expression of CD1C, CD206, CD319, and CD274. Functionally, we found that IFNg signaling induces DC2s to enter the iaDC cell state and that this process can be abrogated by inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we observed LN iaDC residing within a specific chronic inflammatory niche, which was enriched for inflammatory monocytes, NK cells, and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Extrapolating our findings to other chronic inflammation-associated diseases, we similarly observed the emergence of iaDCs within the intestines of treatment-resistant Crohns Disease patients, synovial membranes and lymph nodes of rheumatoid arthritis patients and lungs of sarcoidosis patients. Similarly to the lymph node, iaDCs were found to reside in conserved chronic inflammation-associated spatial niches within the small intestine of affected individuals and displayed equivalent transcriptional characteristics and surrounding cellular neighborhoods. Collectively, these data highlight a previously unexplored role of iaDCs in human chronic inflammatory diseases and propose a conserved spatially restricted iaDC-populated chronic inflammatory niche associated with resistance to therapy. These findings highlight novel avenues to shape inflammatory trajectories by targeting iaDCs and their spatial niches, for example, by inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

This involves cell-surface receptors that can detect conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) or endogenous immunogenic signals, initiating signaling pathways to induce broad-spectrum disease resistance, known as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) MIK2 is an exceptionally versatile receptor involved in the perception of the vast family of Brassicales-specific endogenous SCOOP peptides as well as potential MAMPs derived from Fusarium and related fungi. Although only plant species belonging to the order of Brassicales encode genes for SCOOP peptides and show SCOOP-responsiveness, the Fusarium-derived elicitor fraction also induces PTI responses in plants from other lineages. In this study, we demonstrate that Fusarium elicitor-responsiveness and proteins belonging to the MIK2-clade are widely conserved among seed plants. We identified a MIK2-clade protein from tomato, which shares properties of AtMIK2 in the perception of the Fusarium elicitor but not of SCOOP peptides. Tomato mutants lacking the receptor show compromised PTI responses to the fungal elicitor and enhanced susceptibility to infection by Fusarium oxysporum. Our data provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory of MIK2 as a multifunctional receptor involved in plant immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Fossil evidence from early Paleozoic terrestrial environments provides rare insights into these ancient symbioses, but imaging micro-scale fossil fungi in surrounding plant tissues is challenging. We employed brightfield microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and Raman spectroscopy to investigate a newly identified endomycorrhizal fungus within a 407-million-year-old plant from the Windyfield Chert. An exquisite preservation and our advanced imaging approach enabled the description of the fungal structures to unprecedented detail. The fungus, Rugosomyces lavoisieriae gen. nov., & sp. nov., exhibits structural features resembling modern Glomeromycotina arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Combining CLSM with FLIM provides extra information by separating features based upon fluorescence lifetime. Raman spectroscopy indicates that fungal arbuscules and plant water-conducting cells have undergone geological alterations, resulting in a similar chemical composition. These findings enhance our understanding of ancient plant-fungal symbioses and demonstrate the potential of advanced imaging techniques in paleobotanical research.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

The promoter activates Antp expression specifically in satyrid eyespot center cells, sensitizes these cells to environmental temperatures, and plays a critical role in regulating satyrid eyespot size plasticity.

While much research has focused on the spike (S) glycoproteins of zoonotic alpha- and betacoronaviruses, the S proteins of gamma- and deltacoronaviruses, which predominantly infect avian hosts, remain poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of S proteins from two distinct gammacoronaviruses (75.7% sequence identity) that atypically infect marine mammals and belong to the Gammacoronavirus delphinapteri species. The cryo-EM reconstructions reveal that the spikes exhibit a unique quaternary architecture that distinguishes them from other coronaviruses. The S protein features a previously unidentified, tripodal quaternary assembly of the S1 subunit, in which S1B domains are presented in an upright position while their putative receptor binding sites are shielded by extended loops from the S1A domain of the same protomers. Additionally, the CeCoV spike proteins have evolved an additional and unique [~]200 residue N-terminal domain (S10). S10 lacks homology to known protein sequences but displays structural similarity to members of the cupin protein superfamily. This represents a remarkable case of coronaviral exaptation of a host protein integrated into the S glycoprotein. Moreover, glycoproteomic analyses reveal that CeCoV S proteins are extensively N-glycosylated (>100 N-glycans per trimer), with a notable abundance of high-mannose glycans on S10 and O-glycosylation sites within a mucin-like loop at the trimer apex, all contributing to a dense glycan shield and potentially masking immunogenic epitopes. These findings demonstrate the structural diversity and adaptability of CoV S proteins, including alternative quaternary assemblies, additional domains, and diverse glycosylation strategies, offering new insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that enable coronaviruses to expand their host range and establish infections in novel species.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Conjugative plasmids play a crucial role in ARG spread across hosts within their host range, yet the genetic and functional determinants shaping plasmid host range remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the gene content of conjugative/mobilizable plasmids from public databases and found that two distinct survival strategies were enriched in different host-range groups: a ''stealth'' strategy, which minimizes host fitness costs by employing a global regulator h-ns, was particularly enriched in broad-host-range plasmids, whereas an ''aggressive'' strategy, which protects plasmids by actively inhibiting host response including SOS response by encoding the SOS inhibitor psiB, was more common in narrow-host-range plasmids. Plasmids employing either strategy constituted the majority of all conjugative plasmids analyzed, and accumulated significantly more ARGs than plasmids with neither strategy. Our data further suggested that stealth plasmids facilitate the acquisition of emerging ARGs, while aggressive plasmids amplify the copy number of established ARGs. This ''stealth-first'' model successfully recapitulated historical ARG dissemination patterns. These findings provide critical insights into the relationship between plasmid survival strategies and host range, advancing our understanding of the global patterns underlying plasmid-mediated ARG transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

These potent norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors promote wakefulness, suppress appetite, enhance physical performance, and are purported to increase attentional abilities. Prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have yielded conflicting results about the effects of stimulants on the brains attention, action/motor, and salience regions that are difficult to reconcile with their proposed attentional effects. Here, we utilized resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from the large Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to understand the effects of stimulants on brain functional connectivity (FC) in children (n = 11,875; 8-11 years old) using network level analysis (NLA). We validated these brain-wide association study (BWAS) findings in a controlled, precision imaging drug trial (PIDT) with highly-sampled (165-210 minutes) healthy adults receiving high-dose methylphenidate (Ritalin, 40 mg). In both studies, stimulants were associated with altered FC in action and motor regions, matching patterns of norepinephrine transporter expression. Connectivity was also changed in the salience (SAL) and parietal memory networks (PMN), which are important for reward-motivated learning and closely linked to dopamine, but not the brains attention systems (e.g. dorsal attention network, DAN). Stimulant-related differences in FC closely matched the rs-fMRI pattern of getting enough sleep, as well as EEG- and respiration-derived brain maps of arousal. Taking stimulants rescued the effects of sleep deprivation on brain connectivity and school grades. The combined noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects of stimulants may drive brain organization towards a more wakeful and rewarded configuration, explaining improved task effort and persistence without direct effects on attention networks.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Although the components involved in T4P assembly and dynamics are largely conserved across divergent clades of bacteria, the mechanisms underlying T4P function and regulation differ significantly and remain poorly characterized outside of a select few model organisms. One understudied characteristic of T4P includes the spatial organization of T4P envelope-spanning nanomachines and how organizational patterns contribute to single cell behaviors. The bacterial species Acinetobacter baylyi localizes its T4P nanomachines in a unique pattern along the long axis of the cell, making it a robust model to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of intracellular organization in single cell organisms. In this work, we find that the T4P regulatory protein FimX has been co-opted away from regulating T4P dynamics to instead control T4P positioning through a chemosensory Pil-Chp pathway. We show FimX directly interacts with the Pil-Chp histidine kinase ChpA which likely influences Pil-Chp signaling and the subsequent positioning of T4P machines. These data contribute to our understanding of how bacterial regulatory systems can evolve to function in diverse biological processes.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSubcellular organization of protein complexes plays a vital role in their function in all domains of life, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying subcellular organization in bacteria remain poorly understood.

These data provide insight into how signaling systems can evolve to regulate diverse processes, and they establish a direct connection between environmental signaling cascades and the regulation of bacterial cell biology.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

The mutations nsP1:I167V, nsP2:I171V, nsP2:T224I, nsP3:A382I and nsp4: were detected in the non-structural protein, with the Sri Lankan 2025 CHIKV strains showing unique mutations within nsP3:T224I and nsP4: S90A. As some of these novel mutations have not been characterized previously, it is important to find out how they affect fitness within mosquitoes, viral replication and immune evasion.","NA","medrxiv",1748124511316

The absence of visual mental imagery, called aphantasia, has recently been recognized to occur in about 1% of the general population but the cause is uncertain. By studying rare cases of acquired aphantasia we can identify regions that when injured cause loss of visual mental imagery. Methods We analyzed aphantasia lesions, identified from case reports by systematic review, and previously studied control lesions causing other neuropsychiatric symptoms (n=887). The network of brain regions connected to each lesion location was computed using resting-state functional connectivity from healthy subjects (n=1000). First, we tested the connectivity of aphantasia lesions and controls to the fusiform imagery node, a region in the ventral visual pathway which is active during visual mental imagery tasks. Then, we performed a data-driven analysis assessing whole brain lesion connectivity that was sensitive (100% overlap) and specific (family-wise error p<0.05) for aphantasia. Finally, we compared our aphantasia lesion network to activations previously associated with visual mental imagery tasks. Results We identified 12 cases of lesion-induced aphantasia which occurred in multiple different brain regions. However, 100% of these lesion locations were functionally connected to a region in the left fusiform gyrus, recently termed the fusiform imagery node. Connectivity to this region was both sensitive (100% overlap) and specific (family-wise error p<0.05) for aphantasia. The aphantasia lesion network aligned with functional connections previously associated with visual mental imagery tasks. Conclusions and Relevance Lesions causing aphantasia are located in many different brain regions but are all functionally connected to a specific location in the left fusiform gyrus. These findings support the hypothesis that the fusiform imagery node is a key brain region involved in visual mental imagery and offers clinical insight into which locations of brain injury are likely to cause aphantasia.","NA","medrxiv",1748124511316

Although spatial multiome technologies now enable in situ measurement of both transcriptional activity and chromatin accessibility, existing computational methods either overlook spatial tissue context or are hindered by the high dropout rates characteristic of such data. Here, we introduce EYKTHYR, a computational framework that integrates gene expression and chromatin accessibility within a spatially aware model to identify TFs driving spatial gene programs. EYKTHYR mitigates dropout effects by leveraging interpretable, low-dimensional embeddings of gene expression and chromatin accessibility -- both linear with respect to their input -- enabling robust identification and scalable inference of spatial transcriptional regulators. Applied across diverse spatial multiome datasets, EYKTHYR consistently outperforms existing approaches, accurately identifying TFs that coordinate spatial gene programs in mouse brain development and regulate T-cell states within tumor microenvironments. EYKTHYR establishes a foundation for decoding how TFs interpret local intercellular signaling to shape tissue structure, offering insights into the regulatory logic underlying spatial organization in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Many details of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully understood, including the cell biology and host-virus interactions involved in coronavirus assembly and release, in which the Envelope (E) structural protein is instrumental. Deletion of E in other coronaviruses has been shown previously to either attenuate or abrogate infection. To determine the role of E on SARS-CoV-2 virus production and infectivity, we produced reporter SARS-CoV-2 with or without the E gene deleted using a bacterial artificial chromosome. Replication of {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 was attenuated in Vero E6 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and in human epithelial cell lines. Electron and immunofluorescence microscopy and virology assays showed that {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 increased cell surface expression of Spike (S) glycoprotein, leading to reduced S incorporation into {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 particles and promotion of increased cell-to-cell transmission that evades neutralizing antibody inhibition. Trans-complementation of E partially rescued {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 S incorporation and restored cell-free transmission. In addition to validating the role of E in retention of S in the ER-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), our results showed that a lack of E led to reorganization of the ERGIC during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Improved understanding of E in SARS-CoV-2 replication and host pathogenesis may help development of novel therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Minor temperature oscillations can alert the pathogen to a changing niche ecosystem, necessitating efficient sensing and rapid integration to trigger behavioral change. This is typically achieved through master regulators, which act as umbrella systems dictating pleiotropic phenotypes. Here, we uncover a pivotal role of minor temperature shifts in transition of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) from commensal to virulent lifestyles, mediated via an RNA thermosensing (RNAT) element within the untranslated region of the global regulator CiaR. By positively regulating the expression of the surface adhesin, Phosphorylcholine (PCho), in response to elevated temperature, CiaR potentiates pneumococcal infection. Engineering the RNAT structure to create translation restrictive or permissive versions allowed us to demonstrate how modulation in expression of CiaR could alter pneumococcal invasion capability, influencing infection outcomes. Moreover, intranasal administration of PCho mitigated SPN-induced bacteraemic pneumonia. Since a majority of opportunistic respiratory bacterial pathogens decorate their surface with PCho, this signaling arm could be exploited for anti-infective interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Here, we present the deepest sequence coverage screen of the bacterial N-degron pathway using combinatorial site-saturation mutagenesis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our results reveal new categories of exceptions and nuance to the N-degron pathway observed in bulk and context-specific analyses. For example, we find cases where penultimate residues can reinforce or shift the stability expected based only on the identity of position 1 (P1). We observe lowered stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in bulky residues and Gln as well as heightened stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in negatively charged residues, Gly, and Pro, particularly when these residues are at P2. We find that P1 Cys can be a component of an N-degron in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, we employ machine learning to predict protein stability, identifying several motifs with unexpected fates. Our work expands the sequence determinants of the bacterial N-degron pathway with unprecedented granularity, providing a set of sequence guidelines for proteomic investigation and protein engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

To address evidence gaps, we evaluated long COVID susceptibility in pwMSRD versus controls and its associations with multi-domain function and disability.

MethodsIn this multicenter cross-sectional study, participants completed a survey covering 71 post-infection symptoms, distinguishing new-onset from worsening symptoms. We defined long COVID using the 2024 NASEM criteria. Logistic regression assessed long COVID odds. Linear and Poisson regression evaluated associations with function and disability.

Results969 pwMSRD (82.5% female, mean age 51.8 years, 63.5% infected) and 1,003 controls (79.4% female, mean age 45.2 years, 61.2% infected) were included. PwMSRD had higher odds of long COVID (aOR=1.6 [1.2-2.1]), with a stronger association when restricting to worsening symptoms (aOR=2.3 [1.7-3.1]). Having long COVID was associated with worse physical function, cognition, and depression in both groups. PwMSRD with long COVID experienced greater physical function declines and more depression severity exacerbation than controls, and had faster disability progression compared to those without long COVID.

ConclusionPwMSRD show increased susceptibility to long COVID, primarily driven by worsening symptoms. Long COVID contributes to more functional decline and disability worsening. Recognizing and managing long COVID is essential in pwMSRD.","NA","medrxiv",1748124511316

Following mitotic stress, the ubiquitin-specific protease 28 (USP28) and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) form a stable, heritable complex to stabilize the tumor suppressor p53, triggering cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Here we determine the mechanism by which USP28 stabilizes p53 and show that USP28 is required not only for an efficient stress response but also for maintaining basal p53 levels in some cancer cells. Loss of functional USP28 allows cells to evade mitotic stress and DNA damage responses in a manner that is specific to cell type and cancer context. We identify a prevalent, shorter USP28 isoform critical for p53 stabilization. Its C-terminal domain mediates PLK1-dependent binding to 53BP1, a dimerization-driven interaction necessary for mitotic stress memory, p53 stabilization, and cell cycle arrest. Cancer-associated missense mutations in this domain disrupt 53BP1 binding, impair nuclear localization, and destabilize USP28, compromising p53 stabilization. Notably, mutations in the 53BP1-binding domain occur more frequently in tumors than those in the catalytic domain, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and implications for therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

This calls for the development of DC-targeted interventions purposed to stimulate DC infiltration and local expansion. Here we deliver a proof-of-concept for a cell-based immunotherapeutic approach promoting circulating DC progenitors infiltration in the tumor together with their local expansion. We report that engraftment of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells engineered to express the membrane bound form of FLT3L (eMSC-FLT3L) uniquely induce DC infiltration, T cells activation and anti-tumor immunity, when combined with an adjuvant like the poly(I:C) double stranded RNA mimic. Mechanistic experiments demonstrate that poly(I:C)-induced CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands (CXCL9, CCL5) are required for intra-tumoral DC and T cell recruitment and for the therapeutic effect of eMSC-FLT3L + poly(I:C) immunotherapy. Stromal cell-based delivery of CXCL9 and CCL5, together with FLT3L, by-passes the requirement for poly(I:C) agonist and is sufficient to induce T cell and DC recruitment within tumors.

McdA, a member of the ParA/MinD family of ATPases, forms dynamic gradients on the nucleoid that position McdB-bound carboxysomes. McdB belongs to a widespread but poorly characterized class of ParA/MinD partner proteins, and the molecular basis of its interaction with McdA remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminal 20 residues of H. neapolitanus McdB are both necessary and sufficient for interaction with McdA. Within this region, we identify three lysine residues whose individual substitution modulates McdA binding and leads to distinct carboxysome organization phenotypes. Notably, lysine 7 (K7) is critical for McdA interaction: substitutions at this site result in the formation of a single carboxysome aggregate positioned at mid-nucleoid. This phenotype contrasts with that of an McdB deletion, in which carboxysome aggregates lose their nucleoid association and become sequestered at the cell poles. These findings suggest that weakened McdA-McdB interactions are sufficient to maintain carboxysome aggregates on the nucleoid but inadequate for partitioning individual carboxysomes across it. We propose that, within the ParA/MinD family of ATPases, cargo positioning and partitioning are mechanistically separable: weak interactions with the cognate partner can mediate positioning, whereas effective partitioning requires stronger interactions capable of overcoming cargo self-association forces.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

These responses are mediated by mechanosensory neurons distributed across the body, whose axons project into somatotopically organized brain regions corresponding to body location. How mechanosensory neurons interface with brain circuits to transform mechanical stimulations into location-appropriate behavior is unclear. We previously described the somatotopic organization of bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) around the Drosophila head that elicit a sequence of location-aimed grooming movements (Eichler et al., 2024). Here, we use a serial section electron microscopy reconstruction of a full adult fly brain to identify nearly all of BMN pre- and postsynaptic partners, uncovering circuit pathways that control head grooming. Postsynaptic partners dominate the connectome, and are both excitatory and inhibitory. We identified an excitatory hemilineage of cholinergic interneurons (hemilineage 23b) that elicit aimed head grooming and exhibit varied connectivity to BMNs from different head locations, revealing lineage-based development of a somatotopic parallel circuit architecture. Presynaptic partners provide extensive BMN presynaptic inhibition, consistent with models of sensory gain control as a mechanism of suppressing grooming movements and controlling the sequence. This work provides the first comprehensive map of a somatotopically organized connectome, and reveals how this organization could shape grooming. It also reveals the mechanosensory interface with the brain, illuminating fundamental features of mechanosensory processing, including feedforward excitation and inhibition, feedback inhibition, somatotopy based circuit organization, and developmental origins.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Electrophysiologic measures of cortical excitability hold promise for monitoring disease progression and evaluating therapeutic responses. The power law exponent (aperiodic slope) reflects the balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity within neuronal networks, a critical aspect of normal brain function often disrupted in neurological conditions. Despite its potential, the significance of the aperiodic slope in glioma-infiltrated tissue and its underlying cellular processes has not been fully investigated. Here, we integrate multi-modal electrophysiological analysis with transcriptomic profiling to analyze the aperiodic slope in both normal and glioma-infiltrated cortex. We determine that glioma infiltration induces a flattening of the aperiodic slope, indicating a shift toward excitation dominance that varies according to tumor subtype and correlates with impairments in semantic naming. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that cortical regions with flat aperiodic slope exhibit transcriptional programs enriched in glutamatergic signaling, membrane depolarization, and excitatory synaptic transmission. The aperiodic slope responds to pharmacologically induced changes in cortical inhibition during propofol administration, a GABAA agonist. Our results establish the aperiodic slope as a robust biomarker of glioma-associated excitation-inhibition imbalance, with potential applications in tumor classification and treatment monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Plastic responses vary as a result of genetic differentiation within and among species, so accurate rangewide predictions require characterization of genotype-specific reaction norms across the continuum of historic and future climate conditions comprising a species range. Natural hybrid zones can give rise to novel recombinant genotypes associated with high phenotypic variability, further increasing the variance of plastic responses within the ranges of the hybridizing species. Experiments that plant replicated genotypes across a range of environments can characterize genotype-specific reaction norms; identify genetic, geographic, and climatic factors affecting variation in climate responses; and make predictions of climate responses across complex genetic and geographic landscapes. The North American hybrid zone of Populus trichocarpa and P. balsamifera represents a natural system in which reaction norms are likely to vary with underlying genetic variation that has been shaped by climate, geography, and introgression. Here, we leverage a dataset containing 45 clonal genotypes of varying ancestry from this natural hybrid zone, planted across 17 replicated common garden experiments spanning a broad climatic range, including sites warmer than the natural species ranges. Growth and mortality were measured over two years, enabling us to model reaction norms for each genotype across these tested environments. Genomic variation associated with species ancestry and northern/southern regions significantly influenced growth across environments, with genotypic variation in reaction norms reflecting a trade-off between cold tolerance and growth. Using modeled reaction norms for each genotype, we predicted that genotypes with more P. trichocarpa ancestry may gain an advantage under warmer climates. Spatial shifts of the hybrid zone could facilitate the spread of beneficial alleles into novel climates. These results highlight that genotypic variation in responses to temperature will have landscape-level effects.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

While antibodies targeting the 65 kDa isoform of GAD are of high diagnostic value, T cell mediated cytotoxicity has been identified as a key component of disease pathogenesis. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms by which the disease is triggered and maintained, however, remain incompletely understood. Methods: We performed single-cell transcriptome and immune repertoire sequencing (sc-seq) in CSF and blood of 8 anti-GAD65 AINS patients compared to 8 non-inflammatory controls. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were synthesized from B cell receptor (BCR) data to evaluate the B cellular immune response. Findings: We identified an increase and expansion of activated CD4+ stem cell-like memory T cells (TSCM) in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients. Expanded T cells showed increased expression of proinflammatory genes. The mAb analysis revealed a high frequency of GAD65-reactive BCRs in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients with increased somatic hypermutations compared to non-GAD-reactive BCRs and BCRs from controls. Conclusions: Sc-seq identified clonally expanded CD4+ TSCM in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients harboring cytotoxic properties likely contributing to disease pathogenesis. GAD-reactive B cells circulate in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients further supporting the concept of an antigen-specific intrathecal immune response. Future studies need to clarify the actual pathogenicity of these immune cells and the link between T and B cellular immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of anti-GAD65 AINS.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Their carbon lattice structure, denoted by chiral (n,m) indices, determines the wavelength of their near infrared fluorescence emission. Commercially available SWCNT are polydisperse, containing many (n,m) species with overlapping fluorescence peaks, leading to spectral congestion. Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) has emerged as a valuable tool to sort SWCNT according to their chiral structure and promises improved nanosensor performance as well as unique opportunities for multiplexing. Previous applications of ATPE have enabled ratiometric sensors, but simultaneous detection of multiple analytes using distinct SWCNT chiralities has yet to be realized. This hurdle is largely due to the contrasting surface chemistries needed for ATPE sorting and those needed for biosensing applications. In this work, we introduce a method for purifying multiple chiralities of SWCNT which can be functionalized with molecularly specific antibodies to create a multiplexed sensor platform. We utilize aminated DNA (DNA-NH2), which serves as both a conduit for ATPE sorting and an intermediate linker for later antibody conjugation, to realize this goal. We demonstrate that chemically modified DNA enables ATPE sorting, supporting the broad future utility of the technique. We further show that chirality-sorted SWCNT-DNA-NH2 serve as excellent base constructs for antibody conjugation, forming highly specific sensors with enhanced optical properties (compared to unsorted SWCNT sensors). Importantly, one batch of monochiral base constructs can be functionalized with different antibodies towards different biological applications. Finally, we show that we can sort and functionalize two separate SWCNT chiralities and combine them together to create a multiplexed sensor platform where each peak responds distinctly to its target. There are vast opportunities for expansion of this work through the use of alternative DNA sequences to enable sorting, various SWCNT chiralities, and virtually any commercially available antibody for molecular recognition.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Despite opposition from some HCW unions and protests across the province, mandates remained effective until July 2024. This study examined the lived experience of HCWs in BC of COVID vaccine mandates, focusing on HCWs decision-making process, the mandates impact on their lives and livelihoods, and their views on the effects of mandates on patient care. Methods: We performed a reflexive thematic analysis of responses to one open ended question and open-ended entries to closed questions from within a published survey of a convenience sample of HCWs in BC of diverse vaccination status, professions, ages, socioeconomic status, races/ethnicities, and genders. Respondents were recruited through snowball sampling via social media and professional networks of the research team. The study was approved by the York University Ethics (No. 2023-389). The article is presented in accordance with the COREQ reporting checklist. Results: Textual data from 90 HCWs were collected from within the initial 166 respondents to the survey. Most respondents were unvaccinated, had been terminated for non-compliance with vaccination mandates, experienced personal losses, and reported negative views on mandates and their impacts on patient care. We identified six themes: 1) policies conflicting with scientific evidence and professional practice; 2) conflicts with medical ethics; 3) unacknowledged or dismissed personal hardships; 4) unacknowledged or dismissed physical harms; 5) discrimination against unvaccinated HCWs and patients; and 6) negative impacts on patient care. Conclusions: This study uncovered a concerning pattern within British Columbia healthcare system, with mandatory vaccination leading to substantial social and economic harms for HCWs of all vaccination statuses as well as unvaccinated patients. Mandates appear to have exacerbated labour shortages in the healthcare sector, negatively impacted workplace morale and the quality of patient care, and eroded informed consent. In light of these findings and of available scientific evidence then and now, we conclude that the policy of mandatory vaccination for HCWs has no scientific basis and violates fundamental ethical principles in healthcare practice and policy.","NA","medrxiv",1748124511316

Investigating the development process is vital for uncovering the formation of complex biological systems. However, current approaches to studying development from gene expression rely primarily on single-cell gene expression data to infer developmental trajectories, neglecting the spatial distribution of cells within tissues and their interactions. Although spatial transcriptomics provides spatial context for gene expression, existing algorithms focus mainly on identifying spatial regions without further exploring their developmental connections. In this study, we propose an algorithm for detecting spatial-temporal domains in tissue to trace developmental path (stTrace) using spatial transcriptomics. stTrace integrates the degree of cell development, gene expression, and spatial location to identify ""spatial-temporal domains"", regions where cells share similar functions and developmental stages within the tissue. Moreover, hierarchical relationships exist among these regions, reflecting developmental connections between cells in the tissue. Our experiments on mouse embryo and human breast cancer data revealed that stTrace can detect more refined regions than traditional spatial domain identification algorithms. Furthermore, the directions of developmental paths inferred from hierarchical relationships are consistent with the dynamic trajectories derived from single-cell velocity.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Measurement of newly synthesized proteins has been successfully facilitated with Bio-Orthogonal Non-Canonical Amino acid Tagging (BONCAT) across a multitude of organisms. Here, we use non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs) L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) or L-homopropargylglycine (HPG) incorporation in place of methionine residues into the actively translating Arabidopsis proteome, allowing for that subset of proteins to be enriched for mass spectrometry quantification. Although this technique has seen occasional use in plants, optimization of the protocol to maximize functionality while minimizing organismal stress has not yet been established. Here, we provide evidence for successful implementation through the liquid immersion of seedlings in AHA or HPG-containing media that functions with significantly lower concentrations than the literature standard. Our approach splits acute exposure and incorporation phase of labelling to mitigate potential negative impacts of prolonged NCAA exposure without compromising effective enrichment capacity, and demonstrate that this results in an unperturbed growth phenotype for AHA-treated seedlings. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of this modified approach to enrich newly synthesized proteins from the whole proteome under standard stress conditions. These improvements allow for a broader use of BONCAT technologies in molecular plant research, affording a deeper understanding of the newly synthesized proteome without negatively impacting plant health.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Meloidogyne hapla, a diploid species, is a valuable model for studying root-knot nematodes due to its parasitic diversity, small genome, and a reproductive strategy that facilitates genetic analysis. Here, we present a high-quality chromosome-scale assembly of M. hapla, generated using multiple sequencing platforms including PacBio HiFi, ONT, Illumina and HiC. The 59 Mb assembly comprises 16 chromosome-length scaffolds, notably lacking canonical telomeric repeats. Instead, we identified a tandem 16-mer repeat mainly present at scaffold ends, suggesting an alternative system for chromosome-end maintenance. Genetic linkage analysis of F2 populations derived from crosses between M. hapla strains validated the assembly but also revealed anomalies indicating chromosome structure differences between parental isolates such as fissions, fusions and rearrangements. This analysis also revealed sharply delineated zones of high recombination on most chromosome arms. We also identified 1,258 genes encoding putative secreted proteins (PSP), which should be enriched in genes involved host interaction and pathogenicity. Most of the PSP genes had orthologs in other plant parasitic nematode species, and the majority were pioneers, lacking known functional domains. Notably, we found that PSPs are significantly enriched in high-recombination zones, possibly facilitating their rapid evolution. Overall, our study provides new insights into genome structure of diploid root-knot nematodes and highlights the interplay between genome architecture, recombination, and parasitism. These findings raise new questions about how genetic and genomic adaptations drive the success of root-knot nematodes as plant parasites.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Such condensates, also called membraneless organelles, are increasingly observed in cells and serve as transient hubs for spatial organization and compartmentalization of biomolecules. Along with the transiency of formation and dissolution, their ability to sequester molecules has inspired us to develop BCs as potential vehicles to transport and deliver molecular cargo. We recently reported the design of disulfide bond cross-linked phase-separating peptide (PSP) condensates that spontaneously dissolve in reducing conditions (JACS, 2024, 146, 255299). Based on the premise that the highly reducing cytoplasm could dissolve PSP condensates and release partitioned cargo, here, we demonstrate the ability of PSP condensates to deliver molecular cargo to the cytoplasm of HeLa cells efficiently. We show that PSP condensates deliver a variety of cargos that differ in their sizes and chemistries, including small molecules, peptides, GFP protein (31 kDa), DNA (1.7 kbp), and mRNA. The transfection efficiencies of PSP condensates for delivering DNA and mRNA were also significantly greater than those of a commercial transfection agent. With room to tailor the condensate properties based on cargo and cell types, these results showcase the potential of disulfide-cross-linked PSPs as effective and customizable cellular delivery vehicles, filling a critical demand gap for such delivery systems.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

However, despite this established importance, B cell activation states are underrepresented in functional genomics studies. In this study, we obtained B cells from 26 healthy female donors. We stimulated B cells in vitro with six activation conditions targeting key pathways: the B cell receptor (BCR), Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR9, CD40, and a cocktail that promotes differentiation into double negative 2 (DN2) IgD- CD27- CD11c+ CD21- B cells, a likely pathogenic B cell subset for autoimmunity that is also expanded in infectious diseases.

Here, we established a systematic CRISPR-based protein-tagging approach that enables direct, unambiguous comparison of nuclear localization and genome-wide binding profiles of endogenous ZAD-ZnFs in developing Drosophila embryos. Evidence is provided that a subset of ZAD-ZnFs forms nuclear condensates through the stacking of the N-terminal ZAD dimerization surface. Disruption of condensation activity leads to misregulation of genome-wide binding profiles and lethality, underscoring its functional and physiological significance in development. Importantly, integrative ChIP-seq and Micro-C data analyses reveal that many ZAD-ZnFs colocalize with core insulator proteins such as CTCF and CP190 to strengthen the formation of topological boundaries. We suggest that the diverse molecular functions of ZAD-ZnFs have evolutionally arisen from their ancestral role as insulator-binding proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

While PGSxE regression is potentially more powerful than single-variant genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) due to the aggregation of genetic effects and reduced multiple testing burden, standard PGS reflect many different biological mechanisms, limiting interpretation and potentially diluting pathway-specific interaction signals. Previous work has uncovered significant genome-wide PGSxBMI signal for liver function, but there is an opportunity for additional and more interpretable discoveries. Here, we leverage pathway-specific polygenic scores (pPGS) to discover novel mechanism-specific gene-adiposity interactions. We tested for adiposity interactions impacting three liver-related biomarkers (ALT, AST and GGT) using (1) a standard, genome-wide PGS, (2) an array of pPGS containing variant subsets derived from KEGG pathways, and (3) a GWIS. For ALT, we identified 49 significant pPGSxBMI interactions at a Bonferroni corrected p < 2.7x10-4, 80% of which were not explained by genes close to the 8 loci found in the associated GWIS. Across all biomarkers, we found interactions of BMI with 83 unique pPGS-based on KEGG pathways. We tested alternate pathway collections, including Hallmark gene sets and the KEGG Medicus database, finding that the choice of pathway collection strongly impacts discovery. Our results support the use of pPGS for well powered and interpretable discovery of pPGSxE interactions with adiposity-related exposures for liver biomarkers and motivate future studies using a broader collection of exposures and outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1748124511316

However, path integration is prone to cumulative error, which can be amplified when body-derived information is inconsistent between encoding and retrieval paths. Drawing on evidence from sensorimotor reactivation during memory retrieval, we hypothesized that re-enacting encoding-related movement patterns could serve as a body-derived mechanism to counteract such errors. In a novel virtual reality task with motion tracking, participants learned unique, irregular step sequences linked to specific target distances during an encoding phase. They later reproduced these distances in complete darkness under three conditions: self-paced free retrieval, retrieval with encoding-congruent movements, and retrieval with encoding-incongruent, regular gait. During free retrieval, participants naturally re-enacted encoding-related movements associated with improved distance reproduction. As predicted, distance estimation was significantly more accurate during congruent retrieval than during incongruent retrieval. These behavioral findings are consistent with a neural network model in which retrieved encoding-related motor patterns correct path integration errors in grid cells. Together, these results provide converging behavioral and computational evidence that body-derived, encoding-related motor patterns can enhance distance estimation, possibly by filtering grid cell error accumulation, offering new insights into embodied mechanisms of path integration.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

Previous work demonstrated that spike patterns in cerebellar nuclei neurons were distinct between different movement disorder mouse models. However, often these changes arise from neural dysfunction in the cerebellar cortex, through misfiring, miswiring, or degenerating Purkinje cells. Even though Purkinje cells form the sole output from the cerebellar cortex, their information is relayed to other regions of the motor network via cerebellar nuclei cells. Purkinje cells make GABAergic synapses onto cerebellar nuclei cells, and it is often assumed that changes in Purkinje cell spike patterns result in inverse changes in nuclei cell spike patterns. Here, we test this hypothesis by answering the question of whether a reliable relationship between Purkinje cell and nuclei cell spike patterns exists. Single-cell, in vivo electrophysiology recordings of both cell types from six mouse models for cerebellar movement disorders were analyzed according to parameters relating to spike rate and irregularity. We investigated whether Purkinje cell spike patterns correlated with nuclei cell spike patterns. We found that some parameters for firing irregularity were positively correlated between Purkinje and nuclei cells but no - and particularly no inverse - relationship was observed between Purkinje and nuclei cell spike rate. Overall, this study begins to illuminate that the relationship between Purkinje cells and nuclei cell spike activity in a disease state is more complex and unpredictable. The data suggest Purkinje cell spike activity changes cannot accurately predict nuclei cell changes, which ultimately drive cerebellar disease states. Our findings underscore the importance of studying cerebellar nuclei cell function in cerebellar disease, as lack of changes in Purkinje cell firing patterns can mask disease-causing firing patterns in these cerebellar output cells.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

However, EHR data may be prone to misclassification and unmeasured confounding, requiring systematic mitigation to ensure robust findings.

MethodsIn VEBIS-EHR, a retrospective multi-country COVID-19 VE cohort study, we examined unmeasured confounding using a negative control outcome (death not related to COVID-19) and misclassification from varying data extraction intervals. The evaluation spanned two periods (November-December 2023, January-February 2024), encompassing up to 18.7 million individuals across six EU/EEA countries. Vaccine confounding-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

ResultsaHRs against non-COVID-19 mortality ranged from 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.44) to 0.70 (0.66-0.73) when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Delaying EHR data extraction modestly increased the capture of outcome and exposure events, with some variation by vaccination status. Site-level fluctuations in aHRs did not meaningfully alter the overall pooled VE, suggesting stable estimates despite misclassification related to extraction timing.

ConclusionsWe observed some evidence of unmeasured confounding when using non-COVID-19 deaths as a negative outcome, though the specificity of our negative control must be considered. This result may suggest overestimation of VE, but also the need for further analysis with more specific negative control outcomes and confounding-adjustment techniques. Addressing such confounding using richer data sources and more refined approaches remains critical to ensure accurate, timely VE estimates when using real-world EHR-based data. Extending the delay between the end of observation and data extraction modestly improves the completeness of exposure and outcome data, with limited effect on pooled VE estimates.

O_LIWhat your research question was: Whether vaccine effectiveness estimates based on EHR data are internally valid according to analyses focused on two topics of concern related to EHR-based observational research - unmeasured confounding and misclassification.
C_LIO_LIWhat you found: We observed unmeasured confounding in our estimates when using non-COVID19 deaths as negative outcome, and timing of data abstraction from source EHRs was found to have a small influence on the capture and classification of exposure and outcome.
C_LIO_LIWhy it is important: Our results reinforce earlier evidence of the healthy vaccinee phenomenon indicating possible biases in the estimates of vaccine effectiveness estimates obtained from EHR data and that there appears to be little influence of EHR extraction timing on data completeness.

While oncogenic mutations in gliomas have been well-characterized, their impact on the tumor microenvironment remains poorly understood. To investigate how genomic alterations may influence the glioma microenvironment, we performed an integrative multiomic and spatial transcriptomic analysis of 93 glioma samples (46 IDH-mutant gliomas and 47 IDH-wildtype glioblastoma) from 69 patients representing both primary and recurrent stages. Using whole-genome sequencing, chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C), RNA-seq, and single-cell spatial transcriptomics (Xenium), we defined how major driver mutations influence spatial tumor organization. We found that IDH-mutant gliomas frequently harbored inflammatory microglia expressing CX3CR1 specifically within their astrocyte-like malignant neighborhoods. In contrast, glioblastomas demonstrated relatively higher T-cell infiltration and enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations. We further compared glioblastomas harboring EGFR amplifications due to extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) amplifications versus linear chromosomal 7 gains. Tumors with EGFR ecDNA displayed increased presence of mesenchymal-like malignant cells, and higher interactions between pericytes and mesenchymal-like malignant cells, likely driven by hypoxia-associated vascular proliferation. Our findings reveal that the mode of oncogene amplification--linear versus ecDNA--shapes distinct tumor architectures and transcriptional dynamics. Taken together, our study highlights the role of oncogenic drivers in shaping the glioma microenvironment, revealing subtype-specific cellular ecosystems that could inform targeted therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

This process has been interpreted as a form of active sensing and is associated with faster responses and improved perceptual accuracy. While converging evidence suggests that respiration also shapes interoceptive processing at both neural and behavioural levels, it remains unclear whether individuals actively adjust their breathing to optimize interoceptive performance. In this study, we examined whether healthy participants modulated their respiration during an interoceptive (heartbeat discrimination) and an exteroceptive (tactile detection) task. We analysed respiration both in terms of time-locked activity and inter-trial phase coherence relative to stimulus onset and assessed their relationship with perceptual accuracy. Our results demonstrated that participants systematically adjust their breathing in both amplitude and phase, synchronizing respiration to the anticipated (i.e., cued) onset of stimuli in both tasks. Crucially, task performance was enhanced during exhalation compared to inhalation, suggesting that respiratory modulation supports the perception of both interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.

Significance statementThis study reveals that humans not only synchronize their breathing to anticipated external and internal stimuli, but also perform better when perceiving them during exhalation. By showing that respiration is modulated in both interoceptive and exteroceptive contexts, our findings extend the concept of active sensing to internal bodily awareness. This has important implications for understanding the dynamic interplay between physiology and perception and may guide interventions aimed at improving clinical outcomes in conditions where interoception is disrupted.","NA","biorxiv",1748124511316

We consider the approximate version of this problem, that is, the result set is allowed to contain some false positive matches (but no false negatives), and focus on the specific case where the indexed documents are DNA strings. In this setting, state-of-the-art solutions rely on Bloom filters as a way to index all k-mers (substrings of length k) in the documents. To answer a query, the k-mers of the query string are tested for membership against the index and documents that contain at least a user-prescribed fraction of them (e.g., 75-80%) are returned.

Methods and resultsHere, we explore an alternative index design based on k-mer minimizers and integer compression methods. We show that a careful implementation of this design outperforms previous solutions based on Bloom filters by a wide margin: the index has lower memory footprint and faster query times, while false positive matches have only a minor impact on the ranking of the documents reported. This trend is robust across genomic datasets of different complexity and query workloads.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both).

In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1748124511316

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1748124511316

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.
