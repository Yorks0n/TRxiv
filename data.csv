MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082880

The disease mechanism of ME/CFS is unknown, with no effective curative treatments. In this study, we present a multi-site ME/CFS whole-genome analysis, which is powered by a novel deep learning framework, HEAL2. We show that HEAL2 not only has predictive value for ME/CFS based on personal rare variants, but also links genetic risk to various ME/CFS-associated symptoms. Model interpretation of HEAL2 identifies 115 ME/CFS-risk genes that exhibit significant intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. Transcriptome and network analyses highlight the functional importance of these genes across a wide range of tissues and cell types, including the central nervous system (CNS) and immune cells. Patient-derived multi-omics data implicate reduced expression of ME/CFS risk genes within ME/CFS patients, including in the plasma proteome, and the transcriptomes of B and T cells, especially cytotoxic CD4 T cells, supporting their disease relevance. Pan-phenotype analysis of ME/CFS genes further reveals the genetic correlation between ME/CFS and other complex diseases and traits, including depression and long COVID-19. Overall, HEAL2 provides a candidate genetic-based diagnostic tool for ME/CFS, and our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of ME/CFS, yielding novel insights into therapeutic targets. Our deep learning model also offers a potent, broadly applicable framework for parallel rare variant analysis and genetic prediction for other complex diseases and traits.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082880

Like the mitochondrion, the apicoplast cannot be generated de novo and must be inherited by daughter parasites during cell division. This inheritance relies on coordinated apicoplast positioning and fission, but the molecular mechanisms controlling these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized P. falciparum protein (Pf3D7_0613600), which we name PfAnchor, as a key regulator of apicoplast fission. Using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), we show that PfAnchor localizes to the apicoplast throughout the asexual blood-stage. Conditional depletion disrupts apicoplast fission, leading to incomplete cytokinesis and parasite death. Notably, loss of the apicoplasts elongated branched structure via azithromycin treatment rescues these defects, underscoring Anchors specific role in apicoplast fission. Immunoprecipitation identified an interaction with the dynamin-like GTPase PfDyn2, a key mediator of both apicoplast and mitochondrial fission, establishing PfAnchor as the first apicoplast-specific dynamin adaptor protein. Our findings define PfAnchor as an essential factor for apicoplast fission and inheritance in P. falciparum blood-stage parasites, highlighting parasite-specific organelle division as a potential vulnerability for therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1745014082880

However, the impact of experiencing discrimination on long-term patterns of healthcare utilization is unknown.

ObjectiveTo assess how perceived discrimination in healthcare settings is associated with longitudinal patterns of doctor visits among middle-aged and older adults in the United States.

DesignProspective cohort study of US adults in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) who were followed every 2 years for up to 14 years (2008-2020).

SettingUS population-based cohort study.

ParticipantsAdults aged 50-80 years at baseline who completed the HRS psychosocial questionnaire, answered the question on discrimination in healthcare settings, had complete covariate information, and had at least two waves of follow-up data.

ExposureDiscrimination in healthcare settings was measured at baseline as the self-reported frequency of ""receiving poorer treatment than others from doctors or hospitals."" Responses were dichotomized to indicate any experience of discrimination.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresNumber of doctor visits in the prior two years were reported by participants at each wave. Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) were used to identify distinct longitudinal trajectories (patterns) of doctor visits over time. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine associations between discrimination in healthcare and trajectories of doctor visits while adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioral, and health-related factors.

ResultsAmong 13,422 participants (mean age [~]63.0 years [{+/-}8.0]), approximately 19.4%, reported experiencing discrimination in healthcare at baseline. Results identified five major patterns of doctor visits over time: ""Low"" ([~]2 visits/year, 35.5%), ""Frequent"" ([~]4.5 visits/year, 33.3%), ""Frequent-to-High"" ([~]4.5 to 9 visits/year, 13.7%), ""High-to-Frequent"" ([~]13.5 to 6 visits/year, 10.3%), and ""High"" ([~]11+ visits/year, 6.3%). Discrimination in healthcare was more prevalent among participants with higher-utilization patterns and among those with greater disease burden and social vulnerability. Compared to participants with Low doctor visits, perceived discrimination was significantly greater in those with High-to-Frequent (relative risk ratio [RRR]=1.38; 95% CI, 1.17-1.63; P<.001) and High (RRR=1.62; 95% CI, 1.30-2.03; P<.001) patterns of doctor visits.

Conclusions and RelevanceDiscrimination in healthcare settings is associated with greater numbers of doctor visits, possibly indicating it as a marker of poor quality of care.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs perceived discrimination in healthcare settings associated with long-term patterns of doctor visits among middle-aged and older adults?

FindingsIn this prospective cohort study of United States adults aged 50 to 80, perceived discrimination in healthcare was associated with increased likelihood of belonging to high-frequency doctor visit patterns over 14 years of follow-up, even after adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related factors.

MeaningDiscrimination in healthcare may contribute to fragmented or intensive healthcare utilization patterns, underscoring the need to address discrimination as part of efforts to improve care quality and equity.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082880

In other disease areas, combining genetic risk variants enabled detection of relevant clinical endophenotypes associated with important outcomes, but this has never been applied to MS. Methods: We applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering to genomic risk scores of two cohorts (the prospective cohort study of 1455 Welsh MS patients was used as the discovery cohort and replication was performed in a multi-centre post-mortem Netherlands Brain Bank cohort of 272 MS patients) to predict relevant disease outcomes using survival analysis for time to disability milestones (expanded disability status scale, EDSS), and ANOVA to compare linear clinical outcomes. Results: Three genomic clusters were identified, in each cluster patients had similar genetic profiles. Baseline demographic characteristics were similar between clusters. Welsh patients in cluster 1 attained key disability milestones later, reaching EDSS6, 6 years later (p=0.003) and EDSS8, 13 years later (p=0.02) than those in clusters 2 and 3. Time to EDSS6 was also significantly longer for patients in cluster 1 versus cluster 2 in the NBB-MS cohort (6 years, p=0.04). Genomic clustering is an independent predictor for disease progression compared with well-validated risk factors (Hazard ratio for time to EDSS6 1.3-2.0, all p<0.05). Welsh patients in cluster 2 and 3 also had a significantly greater annual increase in T2 lesion load on serial MR imaging (p=0.04). In cluster 2, patients who had received MS disease modifying treatments (DMT) had a longer time to EDSS6 (p=0.003) compared to those that had received no DMTs, whereas no differences were observed in either cluster 1 or cluster 3. In the NBB-MS cohort, we also observed differences in symptomatology, including earlier development of swallowing problems (p=0.02) or muscle spasticity (p= 0.0008) in cluster 2 patients. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that unsupervised genetic clustering has utility to detect clinically relevant endophenotypes of MS, with genetic cluster 2 patients having a more severe phenotype and higher risk of disability. Moreover, genetic stratification is able to predict response to DMTs and could potentially be used for precision medicine in MS management.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082880

However, we also want to know  for whom is early intervention most effective for? Mega-analysis can offer up complementary insights to meta-analyses regarding the  what works and  for what, while also offering unique insights into the  for whom question.

MethodsHere we conduct a mega-analysis with linear mixed effect modeling on AEIR consortium early intervention datasets totaling n=645 children spanning several countries (e.g., USA, Switzerland, Italy, Israel, and Australia). Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) and other non-ESDM approaches (e.g., EIBI, NDBI, other community/treatment as usual approaches) was evaluated as contrasting intervention types. Models also evaluated intervention intensity, type, participant sex, age at intervention start, and pre-intervention developmental quotient. Subscales of Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) were utilized as outcome measures.

ResultsNeither intervention intensity nor participant sex affected outcomes. ESDM showed faster growth in language and non-verbal cognition compared to non-ESDM intervention. Irrespective of intervention type, earlier intervention start was associated with increased MSEL and VABS scores and decreased ADOS severity. Growth trajectories on the MSEL also varied by pre-intervention developmental quotient, with higher quotients predicting faster growth irrespective of intervention type.

ConclusionsAge at intervention start and pre-intervention developmental quotient are important individualized factors that predict early intervention response. ESDM also impacts language, non-verbal cognition, and core autism features.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082880

MethodsA systematic search of four databases identified studies assessing olfactory identification and cognitive screening in individuals aged 50 years or older. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on 11 studies (660 SCD, 574 CN).

ResultsIndividuals with SCD exhibited lower olfactory identification scores compared to CN participants (SMD = -0.67, 95%CI [-1.31, -0.03], p = .04). Meta-regression analyses indicated that larger cognitive differences between groups were associated with more pronounced olfactory deficits ({beta} = -1.79, p = .02).

However, studies show that 10-20% of patients may be non-responders and require a change in therapy. There is also the emerging concept that a significant percentage of patients may enter clinical remission, with a very high level of disease control and virtually symptom-free. These clinical scenarios and heterogeneity increase the need to develop blood-based biomarkers that can predict outcome. Identifying markers of clinical remission may also have potential for expanding access to other severe asthma patients not currently identified through serum IgE, blood eosinophils, or FeNO. In this study, blood was taken prior to therapy from severe asthma patients (n=31) with a Type 2 endotype, high serum IgE, atopy, and blood eosinophilia who qualified for both Omalizumab (anti-IgE) and Mepolizumab (anti-IL-5) and were randomised to receive either treatment. White blood cells underwent single cell RNA-sequencing and patients were assessed for clinical outcomes over a 6-month period. Non-response to either Omalizumab or Mepolizumab was predicted by a gene signature expressed in antiviral plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Clinical remission was predicted by a common gene signature in rarer CD34+ blood progenitors and circulating MAIT cells with a ROC Curve AUC of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively.

However, the reliance of BrainAge models on neuroimaging features such as gray matter volume and hippocampal atrophy, can introduce biases linked to individuals ages as these features are influenced both by normal aging and AD progression. The potential presence of such age-biases raises a critical question: can BrainAge models trained to estimate biological brain aging make meaningful contributions to AD diagnosis, or does any introduced age-bias conflate aging effects with disease pathology? Understanding how deliberate feature selection impacts this confounding effect is essential for developing reliable age-related biomarkers. Methodology We ranked neuroimaging and neuropsychological features based on their mutual information with age and their discriminative power across clinical groups (cognitively normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment [MCI], Alzheimers Disease, and stable vs. progressive MCI). Iteratively, we trained BrainAge models using different subsets of these features some optimized for predicting aging and others for discrimination of clinical AD stages. We assess the error in BrainAge delta (the difference between predicted biological age and chronological age) and evaluate its classification performance across clinical groups. Finally, we compare using deltas for classification with a logistic regression model directly trained on the neuroimaging features used in the BrainAge models. Results Neuroimaging features are more strongly correlated with aging, while neuropsychological features exhibit greater discriminative power for AD classification. BrainAge models optimized for age prediction yield deltas that are suboptimal when used for classifying AD, whereas models trained to generate deltas optimized to be used for classifying AD have reduced age prediction accuracy. This trade-off suggests that BrainAge models may not optimally separate aging-related changes from disease-specific alterations. BrainAge models have varying classification accuracy as compared to direct utilization of features in logistic regression. However, BrainAge provides a continuous measure, offering a single output that can be used across clinical stages, in contrast to classification approaches that require explicit labels for each disease stage. Conclusion Aging significantly affects BrainAge-based classification of Alzheimers disease. Feature selection plays a critical role in mitigating this effect, as the outputs of models trained to predict age, the deltas, may fail in AD classification. These findings underscore the need for task-specific feature selection and model design to ensure that BrainAge models are appropriately applied in neurodegenerative disease research.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082881

This study aims to delineate the differential involvement and vulnerability of these subdivisions in the early stages of AD progression. Methods: We conducted a resting-state functional connectivity analysis in 32 asymptomatic carriers of the PSEN1 E280A mutation for familial Alzheimer's disease and compared them to 25 non-carrier familial controls. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was applied to the precuneus and its subregions. Results: Among carriers, the 7Am subregion exhibited the most pronounced statistical differences, consisting of increased connectivity with the entorhinal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, insula-operculum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and somatosensory areas. The POS2 subregion further significantly decreased its connectivity with the anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Higher MoCA scores correlated with increased within and between precuneus and frontoparietal network connectivity, alongside decreased connectivity between 7Pm, PCV, POS2, and the medial temporal lobe. Additionally, the 7m subregion displayed significantly higher connectivity with medial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of subregional analysis in precuneus connectivity, uncovering patterns that do not exist when the precuneus is treated as a single region of interest -as is common in neuroimaging studies. Notably, even in preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, early connectivity changes are evident, supporting their potential as biomarkers of disease progression.

India faces an excess burden of OC, but the most common site of occurrence is the cancer of the buccal mucosa, which is relatively rare in EA populations. We conducted a GWAS of buccal mucosa cancer (BMC) comprising 2,160 BMC cases and 2,325 controls from different geographical locations in India. Single-SNP association tests detected one novel locus (6q27) and one novel signal within the known OC risk locus 5p13.33, at the genome-wide significance level (P-value<5x10^-8). We additionally conducted a GWAS of 397 BMC cases and 439 controls from Taiwan and performed multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis of OC on 5255 cases and 8748 controls across EA, Indian and Taiwanese populations. We identified a novel risk locus harbouring the tumour suppressor gene NOTCH1 through a gene-level analysis of the multi-ancestry GWAS data. Pathway analysis suggested that PD-1 signaling, and Interferon Gamma signaling may be important in the etiology of BMC. Within data from the Indian BMC GWAS, we further identified statistically significant evidence of both multiplicative interactions (P-value=0.026) indicating stronger polygenic risk of BMC among individuals with history of chewing tobacco compared to those without. Our study provides insights into the etiologies of BMC in India, highlighting both its similarities and differences with other types of oral cavity cancers, as well as the interactions between polygenic gene score and tobacco chewing.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082881

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082881

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women. Future studies are required to ascertain the association between semaglutide and hair loss.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082881

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082881

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1745014082881
