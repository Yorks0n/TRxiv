Yet, how sap feeders affect floral attractiveness to pollinators remains poorly understood, despite the critical role of this tripartite interaction in natural and agricultural ecosystems. These intricate interactions may be further enriched by pronounced sexual dimorphisms in dioecious species. In this study, we examined how infestation by the oligophagous aphid Brachycaudus lychnidis affects sex-specific interactions among the dioecious plant Silene latifolia and its specialist moth pollinator Hadena bicruris. We exposed male and female plants to aphid herbivory and evaluated its effects on floral traits (visual cues, floral scent, and nectar chemistry) and pollinator behaviour. Contrary to sexual selection theory, female plants were not less attractive than males under control conditions. Instead, our results suggest that females exhibit plasticity in floral trait expression depending on pollination success. Moreover, both sexes produced a diverse array of potentially bioactive nectar metabolites, with females showing higher abundances of many compounds that may influence female pollinator behaviour. Aphid infestation altered floral traits differently between sexes, with stronger declines in female floral attractiveness, suggesting sex-specific defence strategies and possible involvement of indirect defences in stabilizing this specialized plant-pollinator-herbivore system.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

In particular, the extent to which broad host range is enabled by genetic variation versus transcriptional plasticity is unclear. To investigate how variation and plasticity contribute to generalism, we studied the generalist necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea that infects more than 1,500 plant species. Using a cross-infection matrix of 72 B. cinerea isolates infected on 57 plant genotypes distributed across 15 eudicot species, we identified general and host-dependent fungal components of lesion formation. Transcriptome profiling at 48 hours post-inoculation revealed two distinct pathogen gene modules: (1) a set of general lesion-associated genes enriched in primary metabolism, showing similar expression across hosts but varied among isolates; and (2) a set of high-entropy, host specific-inducible genes, organized into distinct co-regulated modules that respond dynamically to specific host cues. Both gene sets were genomically dispersed, lacking structural clustering, and were under different levels of selective constraints. Our results demonstrate that B. cinerea employs a modular transcriptional strategy that integrates a core metabolic program along with a plastic, host-responsive regulatory network to achieve broad host colonization. This study presents the most comprehensive cross-species co-transcriptomic dataset to date for any fungal phytopathogen, highlighting transcriptional plasticity as a key mechanism underlying generalism in plant-fungal interactions. Moreover, the identification of conserved fungal gene targets across diverse hosts offers a foundation for developing broad-spectrum resistance strategies in multiple crops.","[{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IOS2020754;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

While resistance to chemicals that target neuronal ion channels is well-appreciated, dissecting toxin resistance mechanisms is hampered by its complex genetic basis. Here, we investigated how Drosophila sechellia has evolved resistance to octanoic acid (OA), a historically-important paradigm of adaptation to a natural toxin. OA is an abundant component of Morinda citrifolia noni fruit - the exclusive niche of D. sechellia - and is toxic to many other insects, including its close relatives Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster. We experimentally evolved D. simulans populations with increased OA resistance, identifying hundreds of loci displaying signatures of selection. Cross-referencing of these loci with the results of a genome-wide, CRISPR knockout screen for OA tolerance genes in D. melanogaster S2R+ cells highlighted two proteins of interest: Kraken, a putative detoxification enzyme of the serine hydrolase family expressed most strongly in the digestive and renal systems, and Alkbh7, a ubiquitously-expressed, mitochondrial-localised protein, whose mammalian orthologue functions in fatty acid metabolism. In D. sechellia, kraken and Alkbh7 display both signs of selection and elevated expression, mirrored by their higher transcription in artificially-evolved, OA-resistant D. simulans. In D. melanogaster, loss-of-function of kraken, but not Alkbh7, led to increased susceptibility to OA; conversely, overexpression of Alkbh7, but not kraken, increased OA resistance. Importantly, mutation of these genes in D. sechellia demonstrated a contribution of these proteins to the natural resistance of this species, identifying the first specific loci underlying this multigenic trait. Our results suggest an adaptive role of these genes in shaping OA resistance both under laboratory selection and during D. sechellia's evolutionary history. More generally, this work emphasises the experimental power of drosophilids to dissect multilayered molecular mechanisms of toxin resistance, with applications in the development of novel insecticides.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

It is thus critical to better understand their immune system and mechanisms of antiviral immunity. Despite an increasing number of studies, much is still unknown about the molecular mechanisms that govern bat-virus interactions, especially given the large diversity of bat species. Dicer is a conserved ribonuclease with multiple activities that can modulate antiviral immunity, including the detection of viral RNA as part of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, the maturation of micro RNAs, and the direct inhibition of innate immunity in mouse and human cells. In view of these complex activities of Dicer, we tested its antiviral activity in Myotis myotis nasal epithelial cells. Surprisingly, we did not see strong evidence of RNAi in these cells, but instead saw a proviral effect of Dicer for two alphaviruses, Sindbis and Semliki forest virus. We also observed a striking relocalization of Dicer to cytoplasmic foci upon infection with these viruses, which did not occur in the several human cell lines we tested. These foci contained dsRNA and viral plus strand RNA, suggesting that they are sites of viral replication. Finally, we found that factors specific to M. myotis cells are needed for Dicer relocalization. Overall, we propose that Dicer can play different roles in different bat species and/or cell types, and is being repurposed by alphaviruses to promote viral replication.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-IDEX-0002;ANR-20-SFRI-0012;IMCBio ANR-17-EURE-0023;ANR-21-CE35-0018-01;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SPF202209015746;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Understanding spatial factors may have implications for urban rewilding, as its success will depend on local tolerance of wildlife and may potentially increase human-wildlife interactions, such as bin-raiding and public wildlife feeding. We examined how urbanisation, geographic region, and public wildlife feeding influence reported bin-raiding, public attitudes, and the use of control measures towards the world's most urbanised terrestrial carnivore, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes. Online survey data were obtained from 1,275 participants in the United Kingdom. Fox bin-raiding was associated with increased levels of public wildlife feeding, more negative attitudes towards foxes, and greater use of professional and do-it-yourself pest control measures. However, the role of urbanisation and geographic differences varied among these relationships. Specifically, urbanisation and geographic region significantly predicted reports of fox bin-raiding, with urban residents - particularly those living in London - more likely to report such behaviour. Urbanisation influenced people's use of professional pest control of foxes within their area, and geographic region influenced the use of do-it-yourself control measures. Neither urbanisation nor geographic region significantly predicted public attitudes towards foxes. Together, these findings highlight the complex interactions between spatial context, human attitudes and behaviour, and animal ecology, underscoring the importance of nuanced, context-specific strategies to support human-wildlife coexistence and urban rewilding initiatives.","[{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/X018342/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) enables direct observation of these dynamics in individual diffusing receptors, either freely diffusing in solution, using confocal microscopy, or immobilized on surfaces, using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) camera-based microscopy. However, these modalities are limited to distinct timescales - faster than milliseconds or slower than hundreds of milliseconds, respectively - due to constraints of observation time and camera frame rate, while the slow dynamics observed in immobilized receptors may be perturbed by tethering. To overcome these limitations, we employed smFRET in combination with Anti-Brownian Electrokinetic (ABEL) trapping to extend the observation window of untethered A2A adenosine receptors (A2AAR) embedded in lipid nanodiscs from milliseconds to seconds. This approach enabled us to characterize the conformational heterogeneity in both apo and ligand-bound A2AAR, effectively bridging the gap between fast dynamics measured in freely diffusing receptors and slow dynamics observed in immobilized receptors. Our results, taken together with previous studies, demonstrate that both inactive-like and active-like conformations are populated in apo and ligand-bound A2AAR and dynamically interconvert. Apo and antagonist-bound receptors are predominantly locked in inactive-like or active-like states, exhibiting only slow exchange dynamics on timescales longer than hundreds of milliseconds. In contrast, agonist-binding not only shifts the receptor population toward the active-like state but also accelerates the conformational exchange by nearly three orders of magnitude: from hundreds of milliseconds to sub-millisecond timescales. These results underscore the dual role of agonists in modulating both the equilibrium and dynamics of receptor conformations. Our study highlights the power of ABEL-FRET to probe structural dynamics of GPCRs, offering valuable insights into GPCR conformational landscapes and aiding the development of more effective GPCR-targeted therapeutics.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101149735;MemProDx;""},{""name"":""Hasselt University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04nbhqj75"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BOF21BL11;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BO1891/10-2;BO1891/15-1;BO1891/16-1;BO1891/18-2;""},{""name"":""Freistaat Thüringen"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ACP2020;ACP Explore project;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

In parallel, we made diphtheria toxin-mediated cell type ablation compatible with human cells, thereby enabling in-depth interrogation of the sequence of events during depletion and reappearance of stem cells. Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid. Thus, stem cell-derived retinoic acid actively suppresses the regenerative state in colonocytes, explaining how surviving cells sense stem cell loss.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803608;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Structurally homologous to mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), CDNF has been shown to interact with ER-localized chaperone BiP. The ER plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, folding, and quality control, with BiP being a key player in maintaining protein homeostasis. CDNF is protective against ER stress and involved in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling and interaction with BiP. Recent studies have shown that CDNF interacts with UPR sensor proteins PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, suggesting an overlap in CDNF binding with UPR sensors and BiP. In rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD), CDNF protects and restores the function of brain dopamine neurons and was successful in PD phase 1 clinical studies. CDNF has shown therapeutic potential for several neurological diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and ischemic stroke. Despite extensive knowledge on CDNF's impact on cellular function and neuronal degeneration, its detailed molecular mechanism of action in the ER remains unclear. Here, we have characterized the CDNF interaction with BiP both structurally and functionally and solved the crystal structures of CDNF-BiP complexes to 1.5 [A] resolution, complemented with molecular dynamics simulations. Results show CDNF's role as an antagonist of BiP nucleotide exchange, and thus in its chaperone function, binding to the ADP-bound state.

For example, even simple 2D shapes with varying contours have been shown to evoke vivid impressions of different materials (Pinna & Deiana, 2015). However, such static representations capture only a single moment in time. When a material moves, its contours shift, evolve, or deform over time, creating contour motion. Does this contour motion convey diagnostic information about material properties, independent of surface appearance? Existing studies on the role of dynamic cues in material perception either use fully rendered 3D stimuli, where contour motion is confounded with rich surface information, or motion-only displays (dynamic dot stimuli or noise patches), which eliminate surface cues but also lack clearly defined contours. As a result, the relative contribution of contour motion to material perception remains unclear. To address this gap, we measured how human observers perceive materials from dynamic line drawings (""line""), compared to animations of fully textured stimuli that carry optical and motion information (""full""), as well as dynamic dot stimuli (""dot""). Stimuli were rendered versions (full, dot, line) of material animations from five material categories (jelly, liquid, smoke, fabric, and rigid-breakable). In one experiment, participants rated five material attributes (dense, flexible, wobbly, fluid, airy motion), and in a second experiment, participants were asked to choose one of the two materials that is more similar to a third material across all possible combinations. Results from both experiments consistently reveal that 1) Dynamic line drawings vividly convey mechanical material properties, and 2) the similarity in material judgments between line and full conditions was larger than that between dot and full conditions.

While high-resolution structural techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have advanced our mechanistic understanding of protein-substrate interactions, traditional sample preparation methods are too slow to capture rapid biochemical events. Time-resolved cryo-EM has emerged as a promising approach to visualize structural dynamics on microsecond-to-millisecond timescales, but its widespread adoption has been limited by costly equipment and challenges in achieving rapid mixing, application, and vitrification of samples in a reproducible manner. To address these limitations, we developed ""Mix-it-up"" (MIU), a modified spray device designed for rapid on-grid mixing and vitrification of cryo-EM samples. By manually applying one sample onto the EM grid, blotting, and subsequently spraying the second sample, we achieve on-grid mixing with a vitrification delay of as low as ~120 milliseconds. We demonstrate MIUs time-resolved capabilities through high-resolution structure determination of mixed samples, pH-induced viral capsid contraction, and ligand-dependent complex formation. These findings establish MIU as a cost-effective, versatile tool for studying rapid biochemical processes and lay the groundwork for future applications to time-resolved cryo-EM.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM143805;GM154216;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood2,3. To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

By contrast, Plasmodium falciparum parasites use multiple RBC receptors for invasion. Whether DARC is one of these receptors has never been systematically explored. We used flow cytometry and microscopy-based approaches to investigate whether P. falciparum parasites preferentially invade specific Duffy RBC phenotypes and explored two potential explanations for invasion preference - differences in RBC biophysical properties and surface protein composition. P. falciparum parasites showed a consistent preference for Duffy-positive RBCs, and some biophysical properties and surface protein expression varied between Duffy-positive and Duffy-negative RBCs. We then used our in vitro invasion data to parametrise an evolutionary- epidemiological model of the relationship between P. falciparum and the FYBES allele. Our model accounts for immunity against P. falciparum virulence, gained through exposure, and thus mutations that impede infection are not always advantageous. The inhibition of P. falciparum invasion that we observed in vitro leads to FYBES frequencies increasing at low levels of P. falciparum transmission but decreasing at high levels of transmission. The impact of P. falciparum on the prevalence of Duffy negativity may therefore be most apparent in lower transmission settings. Our findings are the first to show a link between Duffy negativity and P. falciparum and suggest that DARC may direct or indirectly be involved in P. falciparum invasion of human RBCs which could, together with P. vivax, explain the distribution of Duffy negativity in sub-Saharan Africa.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220266/Z/20/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2235451;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MPTMPS-00005320;""},{""name"":""NUCATS T32, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ryan Fellowship, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""CSB postdoc fellowship, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""IVADO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Canada First Research Excellence Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM147400;""},{""name"":""Pew-Stewart Scholars Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Awards at the Scientific Interface"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

It provides the first national-scale map of banana cultivation in Benin and identifies high-risk areas for targeted intervention.
C_LIO_LIThe study highlights the dominance of informal networks for exchange of planting material ([~]80% of farmers), limited farmer awareness of BBTV ([~]60% unaware), and low recognition of symptoms or transmission routes, all of which contribute to the spread and persistence of disease.
C_LIO_LIAlthough women represented only a quarter of respondents, they demonstrated comparable levels of market orientation and access to planting materials and land. The findings call for spatially targeted, socially informed BBTV management strategies that integrate clean planting material systems, farmer education, and accessible control methods.
C_LIO_LIBBTV was detected in 140 out of 747 fields surveyed, with the highest prevalence in the humid southern regions. No cases were found in the northern Sudanian zone, reflecting known agroecological patterns of disease distribution.
C_LIO_LIModelling of three control strategies - decapitation, uprooting, and injection - revealed injection as most effective nationally (70% reduction in disease incidence), while uprooting was most effective in vulnerable communities with high disease pressure.
C_LIO_LIThe study reveals an interconnected system in which socioeconomic vulnerability, informal seed networks, limited disease awareness, and spatial clustering of banana cultivation collectively drive BBTV dynamics in Benin, highlighting the need for epidemiologically effective, socially informed, and spatially targeted interventions.

Societal Impact StatementBanana and plantain are critical for food security and income generation in West Africa, particularly for smallholder farmers in countries such as Benin. However, banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) poses a major threat to sustainable production. This study integrates high-resolution remote sensing, field epidemiology, mathematical modelling, and socioeconomic analysis to improve understanding of the spread of BBTV and to evaluate the effectiveness of different disease control strategies. Our findings reveal that BBTV risk is highest in southern Benin, where socioeconomic vulnerability is also greatest. Low disease awareness, limited adoption of effective control methods and informal exchange of planting material exacerbate this risk. By identifying priority areas and strategies tailored to local social, economic, and agroecological contexts, this research offers a roadmap for designing targeted, sustainable BBTV management programs. These insights can support smallholder resilience, reduce disease burden, and safeguard banana-based livelihoods across sub-Saharan Africa.","[{""name"":""Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV070408;INV010652;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

The molecular changes during initiation and establishment of symbiosis are of great interest, but quantitatively monitoring such changes can be challenging, particularly when the microorganisms differ greatly in size or are intimately associated. Here, we analyze output from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) LC-MS/MS proteomics experiments investigating the well-studied interaction between the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the heterotrophic bacterium Mesorhizobium japonicum. We found that detection of bacterial proteins decreased in coculture by 50% proteome-wide due to the abundance of algal proteins. As a result, standard differential expression analysis led to numerous false-positive reports of significantly downregulated proteins, where it was not possible to distinguish meaningful biological responses to symbiosis from artifacts of the reduced protein detection in coculture relative to monoculture. We show that data normalization alone does not eliminate the impact of altered detection on differential expression analysis of the cross-kingdom symbiosis. We assessed two additional strategies to overcome this methodological artifact inherent to DDA proteomics. In the first, we combined algal and bacterial monocultures at a relative abundance that mimicked the coculture, creating a ""mono-mix"" control to which the coculture could be compared. This approach enabled comparable detection of bacterial proteins in the coculture and the monoculture control. In the second strategy, we enhanced detection of lowly abundant bacterial proteins by using sample fractionation upstream of LC-MS/MS analysis. When these simple approaches were combined, they allowed for meaningful comparisons of nearly 10,000 algal proteins and over 4,000 bacterial proteins in response to symbiosis by DDA.

In this work, we sequenced the complete genome of the new species Embleya australiensis MST-11070 and validated the assembly using optical mapping. The genome of E. australiensis MST-11070 consists of a 7.1 Mb linear chromosome and three additional replicons, including a 4.2 Mb linear replicon, EEC1, significantly larger than all previously described secondary replicons from bacteria. EEC1 is typified by its similar composition to the chromosome in terms of GC-content, codon usage and gene functions. It also carries terminal inverted repeats identical to the chromosome. EEC1 is enriched in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including the only copy of the BGCs for the spore pigment and the surfactant peptide SapB, metabolites essential for the organisms lifecycle. EEC1 contains an origin of replication with at least some chromosomal properties, and its replication is likely to depend on functions provided by chromosomally located genes. Further comparison of Embleya spp. genomes suggests that EEC1-like replicons are conserved across the genus, in contrast to other known large linear extrachromosomal replicons (megaplasmids) in the order. EEC1 is thus a hallmark of the Embleya genus and is central to its evolution within the Streptomycetaceae family. We propose EEC1 as a secondary chromosome, distinct from previously described secondary chromosomes that utilise plasmid-like replication mechanisms (chromids) and the largest secondary replicon reported in bacteria, to date.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/P021506/1;BBS/E/J/000PR9790;BB/X01097X/1;BB/M011216/1;""},{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF22OC0078997;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

These interactions can support the persistence of resistant cells even in the absence of treatment, undermining standard aggressive therapies and motivating drug holiday-based approaches that leverage ecological dynamics. A key challenge in implementing such strategies is efficiently identifying interaction between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subpopulations. Evolutionary game theory provides a framework for characterizing these interactions. We investigate whether spatial patterns in single time-point images of cell populations can reveal the underlying game theoretic interactions between sensitive and resistant cells. To achieve this goal, we develop an agent-based model in which cell reproduction is governed by local game-theoretic interactions. We compute a suite of spatial statistics on single time-point images from the agent-based model under a range of games being played between cells. We quantify the informativeness of each spatial statistic and demonstrate that a simple machine learning model can classify the type of game being played. Our findings suggest that spatial structure contains sufficient information to infer ecological interactions. This work represents a step toward clinically viable tools for identifying cell-cell interactions in tumors, supporting the development of ecologically informed cancer therapies.

Author summaryDrug resistance is a major challenge in cancer treatment, often leading to relapse despite initially successful therapy. While mutations are a key driver, ecological interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells also play a critical role. These interactions are complex and dynamic, and few molecular biomarkers exist, making them difficult to study and account for in treatment planning. We use evolutionary game theory, a framework for quantifying interactions between cells, to investigate whether it is possible to infer these interactions using just a single time-point image of the cells. We develop an agent-based model where cells reproduce based on local interactions and quantify the resulting patterns in how cells are distributed across space using a suite of spatial statistics. We find that specific interaction types produce distinct spatial patterns that are evident in these metrics, and we train a simple machine learning model to classify the interaction type based on the metrics. Our results suggest that spatial data alone can offer valuable insights into tumor dynamics, potentially enabling more informed and adaptable cancer treatments based on eco-evolutionary principles.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01CA280829;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

This groundbreaking discovery, made in part possible through the genomic analysis of archaic remains, reshaped our understanding of human origins, and opened new research avenues to study the effects and consequences of archaic introgression. While significant progress has been made in identifying and quantifying archaic introgression, most studies have focused on contemporary individual genomic data. As a result, relatively little is known about the evolution of archaic variants within modern human populations shortly after interbreeding occurred. While analysis of ancient DNA from modern humans offers the potential to address this scientific gap, its poor quality has hindered its exploration. However, recent studies have shown that imputation using contemporary reference panels can accurately infer missing genotypes in ancient genomes. Here, we investigate the feasibility of using imputation to improve both global and local archaic ancestry inference in ancient genomes, by downsampling to different low-coverage values and imputing 20 high-coverage (>10X) ancient genomes, representing individuals from diverse temporal and geographical contexts.

We tested the reliability of detecting and quantifying archaic introgression using D-statistics and the f4-ratio. We identified consistent results from the imputed and the original ancient genomes, suggesting that genomic estimates to detect and quantify introgression work well in imputed genomes. Regarding Local Ancestry Inference we find that we can identify more introgressed segments in imputed genomes than in non-imputed genomes. Surprisingly, we find that imputation accuracy is even higher in regions of archaic ancestry compared to other regions of the genome, facilitating the detection of introgressed segments in imputed genomes. Imputation also allows detection of Denisovan segments in Siberian and Alaskan individuals. We show that segments identified even at 0.0625X coverage can be used to reconstruct the history of introgressed haplotypes. For example, comparisons with archaic segments in contemporary humans reveal that the oldest individual analyzed, UstIshim, carried segments that are now found exclusively in either European or East Eurasian populations, indicating that these segments co-occurred in a shared ancestral population. By comparing only ancient individuals, we demonstrate that clustering based solely on the identified archaic segments effectively groups individuals into genetic clusters that correspond to populations defined by geography and time. This analysis shows a clear distinction between individuals with Denisovan introgression and those without, as well as a more detailed separation between Mesolithic and Neolithic Europeans, with the latter closely resembling Central Eurasian individuals. Furthermore, despite the small sample size in this study, we are able to reconstruct the origins of genes identified as candidates for adaptive introgression in contemporary populations, such as the BCN2 gene, which is an adaptively introgressed gene identified in contemporary West Eurasians. Additionally, we identify new candidates for adaptive introgression including LEMD2 and MLN in Europe. In this gene-region, imputation helps resolve the introgressed haplotype, which is closest to the Vindija Neanderthal haplotype.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-2018-STG, 804994;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGY0075/2019;""},{""name"":""French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE45-0010;""},{""name"":""Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""24/PATH-S/12372;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

ResultsIn this study we benchmark structure prediction methods on unseen antibody-antigen complexes reveals that: (i) increased sampling improves the chances of generating correct models in a roughly log-linear way, (ii) for all methods, a significant challenge is identifying the correct models among those generated, (iii) AlphaFold3 outperforms AlphaFold2, Boltz-1 and Chai-1, and (iv) AlphaFold3s performance declines significantly for complexes lacking structural similarities to the training set, indicating that it has primarily learnt to detect remote structural similarities rather than to learn the physics of interactions.

In this study, we fit a family of two-population models to in-vitro data from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), tracking drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells under varying environmental conditions. The dataset, originally presented by Kaznatcheev et al., includes conditions with and without the drug Alectinib and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We compare combinations of growth models (logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy) and drug efficacy terms (Norton-Simon, linear, ratio-dependent) to identify which best explains the observed dynamics. Our models incorporate density dependence, frequency-dependent competition, and drug response, enabling mechanistic interpretation of tumor cell interactions. The logistic model with ratio-dependent drug efficacy best fits monoculture data. Using growth parameters from monocultures, we infer inter-type competition coefficients in co-cultures. We find that growth rate and carrying capacity are stable across CAF conditions, while competition and drug efficacy parameters shift, altering interaction dynamics. Notably, CAFs promote coexistence between resistant and sensitive cells, whereas Alectinib induces competitive exclusion. Our results underscore the need to evaluate both model fit and biological plausibility to guide therapeutic modeling of cancer.

Author summaryHow cancer cells grow, compete, and respond to treatment depends not only on the drug, but also on their ecological context, including interactions with other cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explore how different mathematical models capture the behavior of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells under various conditions. We focus on two cell populations: one sensitive to treatment, and one resistant. Using in-vitro data, we compare growth models and drug response types to identify which model best explains the observed population dynamics. We also investigate how different factors, such as the drug Alectinib and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), change the way cancer cells interact. Our game-theoretic approach allows us to quantify how these external conditions affect competition between cell types, revealing when resistant and sensitive cells can coexist. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of tumor ecology and may support the development of adaptive cancer therapies that anticipate evolutionary responses to treatment.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover.","[{""name"":""Denver Zoo"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02cxp1807"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Lion Recovery Fund, Wildlife Conservation Network"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Adventure Travel Conservation Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD115268;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks.

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","[{""name"":""Levy-Longenbaugh Donor-Advised Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DBI-2321666;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0019749;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM157729;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription.

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

One of the most promising applications of these FMs is perturbation response modeling. This task aims to forecast how cells will respond to drugs or genetic interventions. Accurate perturbation response models could drastically accelerate drug discovery by reducing the space of interventions that need to be tested in the wet lab. However, recent studies have shown that FM-based models often struggle to outperform simpler baselines for perturbation response prediction. A key obstacle is the lack of understanding of the components driving performance in FM-based perturbation response models. In this work, we conduct the first systematic pan-modal study of perturbation embeddings, with an emphasis on those derived from biological FMs. We benchmark their predictive accuracy, analyze patterns in their predictions, and identify the most successful representation learning strategies. Our findings offer insights into what FMs are learning and provide practical guidance for improving perturbation response modeling.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Viruses can inhibit nucleotide immune signaling by producing proteins that sequester or cleave the immune signals. Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6. Our study explains how phages commonly evade bacterial immune signaling, and offers a structure-guided analytical approach for discovery of viral immune-manipulating proteins in any database of choice.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

We transformed our library into 72 diverse strains of E. coli. Each strain natively harbors a different suite of antiphage systems whose activation typically inhibits growth. By tracking plasmids that were selectively depleted, we identified over 100 candidate phage trigger-E. coli pairs. Two phage trigger proteins were investigated in detail, revealing a novel antiphage system that detects multiple phage tail fiber proteins and identifying major capsid protein as the activating ligand of the antiphage system Avs8.

The mechanisms that initiate endocytic actin assembly are incompletely understood. In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, actin assembly is initiated by Dip1, an Arp2/3 activator. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of actin assembly has remained a mystery. Here we show that S. cerevisiae Ldb17, the homolog of Dip1, functions as an on-switch for endocytic actin assembly. Unexpectedly, the regulation of Ldb17 is more complicated than that of constitutively active Dip1. Ldb17 is controlled by a coat protein, Sla1, via separate recruitment and activation steps. This regulation was likely lost in the S. pombe lineage and this simplification may be related to other changes in actin assembly between these species. Our findings add a key missing piece in the understanding of endocytosis in S. cerevisiae and reveal an intriguing evolutionary tinkering of the actin on-switch.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""212288;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Neurons exhibit a wide variety of selective response properties, but the reasons for this diversity are unknown. Here, we related the distribution of neuronal tuning properties to the information capacity of the population. Our results from theory, simulations, and analysis of recordings from macaque primary visual cortex (V1) reveal that diversity of amplitude and bandwidth drive complementary changes to the representational geometry of a population. Amplitude diversity pushes the centers of the representations further apart, whereas bandwidth heterogeneity decorrelates the center locations. These geometric changes separate out representations for distinct stimuli, creating more efficient encoding. We study how both types of diversity affect the population code for two different perceptual tasks: discrimination and identification. While both types of diversity improve encoding for both tasks, their distinct impacts on geometry make each more beneficial for one of the two tasks. Amplitude diversity impacts coding efficiency more for discrimination than it does for identification, while bandwidth diversity has a stronger impact on identification. These complementary effects indicate the importance of both types of diversity for perception. Finally, because tuning diversity exists across species and brain areas, our results suggest a fundamental neural coding strategy that may be applicable to a wide range of behavior.

SignificanceThe visual system supports many perceptual tasks, such as discriminating and identifying specific visual stimuli. This flexibility is supported by the coordinated responses of neurons in the visual cortex. What neuronal response properties affect our perceptual abilities? Here, we show how two types of response diversity shape the geometry of neural responses to improve the population code for two types of perceptual tasks. Each diversity type creates a different geometric transformation. One transformation improves our ability to discriminate similar targets, while the other improves our ability to find one target among many distractors.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DA059220;5T90DA059110;""},{""name"":""National Eye Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wkg3b53"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5T32EY007136;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""543019;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

We combined chemically imposed immune activation with single-cell transcriptomics to profile ETI responses across all leaf cell types in Arabidopsis. Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions. Our findings uncover a layered immune architecture in plants, challenges the assumption of uniform immune execution, and provides a framework for exploring cell-type-specific resistance logic in multicellular hosts.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101039824;""},{""name"":""Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.193.104;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF-842-2015;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753827036450

Despite their impact on genome stability and evolution, the mechanisms governing SINE transcription remain poorly understood. Although DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation have been implicated in their repression, we find these pathways play only a minor role in mouse embryonic stem cells. Instead, we identify the ChAHP complex as a key repressor of SINE B2 elements. ChAHP directly inhibits POL III transcription by blocking TFIIIB recruitment without affecting TFIIIC binding. This selective interference prevents transcription initiation and highlights a distinct regulatory mechanism.

As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation.

By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types.
