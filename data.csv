In healthy controls (HC) regulation of CBF is complex and involves multiple mechanisms including cardiac output (CO), cerebral perfusion pressure, PO2 and PCO2, flow-metabolism coupling, and innervation of cerebral vessels. In ME/CFS multiple other mechanisms have also been identified.

Aim of the studyWe previously found that both CBF and CO were reduced in ME/CFS patients during tilt testing, and we hypothesized that the relation between CBF and CO is abnormal and different from HC. In this retrospective study we analyzed this relation in a large group of patients. To compare the patient data with those of HC, we focused on patients with a normal heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) response to upright tilt. Also, the influence of clinical data was analyzed.

MethodsA total of 534 ME/CFS patients and 49 HC underwent tilt testing with measurements of HR, BP, CBF, and CO. In 46 (9%) patients CO and CBF changes were in the normal range of HC, and in 488 (91%) an abnormal CO and CBF reduction was found.

Resultspatients with a CO and CBF reduction in the range of HC had less severe disease and were more likely to be male. In patients with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction the slope of the regression line of CO versus CBF reduction was almost 1. A multiple regression analysis of the latter group, including patients with PetCO2 measurements (440/488: 90%) showed that the CO reduction for the major part predicted the CBF reduction, with a limited role for the PetCO2 reduction and the tilt duration. Other data did not add to the model.

ConclusionsTwo different patient groups with a normal HR and BP response during the tilt were identified: those with a CO and CBF in the normal range of HC and those with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction during the tilt (91% of patients). The former group had milder disease and included more men. In the largest group of patients there was an almost 1:1 relation between the CO and CBF reduction, suggesting absence of compensatory vasodilation in the cerebral vasculature. This may be an appropriate target for clinical and therapeutic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

However, the extent to which these viral prospecting efforts have enhanced preparedness for disease outbreaks remains poorly characterized, especially in terms of whether they are necessary, sufficient, or feasible ways to spur medical countermeasure development. We find that several viruses which pose known threats to human health lack approved vaccines and that known viruses discovered in human patients prior to 2000 have caused most major 21st-century outbreaks. With Filoviridae as a case study, we show there is little evidence to suggest that viral prospecting has accelerated countermeasure development or that systematically discovering novel zoonotic viruses in animal hosts before they cause human outbreaks has been feasible. These results suggest that prospecting for novel viral targets does not accelerate a rate-limiting step in countermeasure development and underscore questions about the importance of zoonotic viral discovery for outbreak preparedness. We consider limitations to these conclusions and alternative but related approaches to preparedness and response.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study examined the relationships between macronutrients, dietary components, and sleep parameters, considering their interdependencies.

MethodsData from 4,825 users of sleep and nutrition apps for at least 7 days were analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis investigated associations between quartiles of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats), dietary components (sodium, potassium, dietary fiber, and sodium-to-potassium ratio), and sleep variables (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], and % wakefulness after sleep onset [%WASO]). Nutrients were divided into quartiles, with the lowest intake group as the reference. Compositional data analysis accounted for interdependencies among macronutrients. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

ResultsHigher protein intake was associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.27). Higher total fat intake was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.27) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.25, -0.07). Higher carbohydrate intake was associated with shorter %WASO in the 3rd (B = -0.82, 95% CI = -1.37, -0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.57, 95% CI = -1.13, -0.01), while higher total fat intake was linked to longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.06, 1.18). Higher dietary fiber intake was consistently associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.19) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26), shorter SL in the 2nd (B = -1.71, 95% CI = -2.66, -0.76), 3rd (B = -2.23, 95% CI = -3.19, -1.27), and 4th quartiles (B = -2.30, 95% CI = -3.27, -1.33), and shorter %WASO in the 2nd (B = -1.06, 95% CI = -1.61, -0.51), 3rd (B = -1.04, 95% CI = -1.59, -0.48), and 4th quartiles (B = -1.05, 95% CI = -1.61, -0.48). A higher sodium-to-potassium ratio was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.02) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.28, -0.10), longer SL in the 2nd (B = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.08, 1.98) and 4th quartiles (B = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.53, 2.47), and longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.15, 1.28). Compositional data analysis, involving 6% changes in macronutrient proportions, showed higher protein intake correlated with longer TST (B = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.35), while more monounsaturated fats were linked to longer SL (B = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.93, 7.34) and %WASO (B = 2.21, 95% CI = 0.63, 3.78). Higher polyunsaturated fat intake correlated with shorter TST (B = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.39, -0.05), shorter SL (B = -4.72, 95% CI = -6.58, -2.86), and shorter %WASO (B = -2.00, 95% CI = -3.08, -0.92).

ConclusionsThese findings highlight the intricate relationships between dietary factors and sleep outcomes. Prospective studies are warranted to determine whether dietary interventions result in positive sleep outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

MethodsThis study uses the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to investigate the potential relationship between vaccinations and the incidence of NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD. Potential risk factors, such as age, sex, type of vaccine, and previous history of autoimmune diseases, were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

ResultsOur analysis included 161 cases: 72 NMOSD, 82 AE, and 7 MOGAD. The COVID-19 vaccine was implicated in 19/72 (26.3%) NMOSD, 43/82 (52.4%) of AE and 6/7 (85.7%) of MOGAD. The subacute temporal profile (OR 24.4, p = 0.004) and the presence of any comorbidity (OR 12.49, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with hospitalization for those with NMOSD. The subacute onset of symptoms and encephalopathy was statistically significant for hospitalization (OR 6.15, p = 0.048) and (OR 10.3, p = 0.005) respectively for patients with AE. Anti-NMDAR (N-methyl D-aspartate) antibodies were observed in 16/24 (66.7%) of AE. Treatment often involved high-dose corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

ConclusionsMost cases of vaccine induced NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD occurred secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The subacute onset of symptoms and the presence of encephalopathy was most associated with hospitalization.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

We identified biomarkers of T1D by combining plasma cis and trans protein QTLs (pQTLs) for 2,922 proteins in the UK Biobank with a T1D genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 157k samples. T1D risk variants at over 20% of known loci colocalized with cis or trans pQTLs, and distinct sets of T1D loci colocalized with immune, pancreatic secretion, or gut-related proteins. We identified 23 proteins with evidence for a causal role in using pQTLs as genetic instruments in Mendelian Randomization which included multiple sensitivity analyses. Proteins increasing T1D risk were involved in immune processes (e.g. HLA-DRA) and, more surprisingly, T1D protective proteins were enriched in pancreatic secretions (e.g. CPA1), cholesterol metabolism (e.g. APOA1), and gut homeostasis. Genetic variants associated with plasma levels of T1D-protective pancreatic enzymes such as CPA1 were enriched in cis-regulatory elements in pancreatic exocrine and gut enteroendocrine cells, and the protective effects of CPA1 and other enzymes on T1D were consistent when using instruments specific to acinar cells. Finally, pancreatic enzymes had decreased acinar expression in T1D, including CPA1 which was altered prior to onset. Together, these results reveal causal biomarkers and highlight processes in the exocrine pancreas, immune system, and gut that modulate T1D risk.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

In cases of sinusitis, among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in children, healthcare providers must distinguish between bacterial and viral causes based on clinical signs and symptoms. However, due to the overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper respiratory infections, antibiotics are often over-prescribed. Objectives: Currently, there are no electronic health record (EHR)-based methods, such as lab tests or ICD-10 codes, to retroactively assess the appropriateness of these prescriptions, making manual chart reviews the only available method for evaluation, which is time-intensive and not feasible at a large scale. In this study, we propose using natural language processing to automate this assessment. Methods: We developed, trained, and evaluated generative models to classify the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions in 300 clinical notes from pediatric patients with sinusitis seen at a primary care practice in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia network. We utilized standard prompt engineering techniques, including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting, to refine an initial prompt. Additionally, we employed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to train a medium-sized generative model Llama 3 70B-instruct. Results: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning did not enhance performance, the combination of few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting proved beneficial. Our best results were achieved using the largest generative model publicly available to date, the Llama 3.1 405B-instruct. On our test set, the model correctly identified 91.4% of the 35 notes where antibiotic prescription was appropriate and 71.4% of the 14 notes where it was not appropriate. However, notes that were insufficiently, vaguely, or ambiguously documented by physicians posed a challenge to our model, as none evaluation sets were accurately classified. Conclusion: Our generative model demonstrated strong performance in the challenging task of chart review. This level of performance may be sufficient for deploying the model within the EHR, where it can assist physicians in real-time to prescribe antibiotics in concordance with the guidelines, or for monitoring antibiotic stewardship on a large scale.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

However, lipid consumption at the individual-level does not vary greatly within most cohorts, and multiple lipids are rarely measured in any one study.

METHODSMean country-level lipid intakes were compared to Age-Standardized Alzheimer-Disease-Incidence-Rates(ASAIR) in 183 countries across all inhabited continents. Penalized spline regression and multivariable-adjusted linear regression, including a lag between intake and incidence, were used to assess the relationships between five lipid intakes and ASAIR. Validation was conducted using longitudinal within-country changes between 1990 and 2019.

RESULTSOmega6 Polyunsaturated-Fatty-Acid(PUFA) intake exhibited a positive linear relationship with ASAIR(multivariable-adjusted model: {beta}=2.44; 95%CI: 1.70, 3.19; p=1.38x10-9). ASAIR also increased with saturated-fat, trans-fat, and dietary-cholesterol up to a threshold. The association between Omega6-PUFA and ASAIR was confirmed using longitudinal intake changes.

Despite the far-reaching epidemiological implications of this trend, the extent to which antimicrobial resistance load varies within human populations and the drivers that contribute most to this variation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate in a representative cohort of 7,095 Finnish adults1 that socio-demographic factors, lifestyle, and gut microbial community composition shape resistance selection and transmission processes. Antimicrobial resistance gene load was linked not only to prior use of antibiotics, as anticipated, but also to frequent consumption of fresh vegetables and poultry, two food groups previously reported to contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Interestingly, ARG load was not associated with high-fat and -sugar foods. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance gene load was systematically higher in females and the generally healthier high-income demographics in urban and densely populated areas. Data from this prospective cohort with a 17-year follow-up suggests that the prognostic potential of antimicrobial resistome is comparable to blood pressure for mortality and sepsis. These findings highlight population-level risks and socio-demographic dimensions of antimicrobial resistance that are particularly relevant in the current context of global urbanization and middle-class growth.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

Viral RNA samples were fast tracked for genomic surveillance following the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by diagnostic laboratories or public health network units in Ceara (Brazil) and analyzed using paired-end sequencing and integrative genomic analysis. Validation of a key structural variation was conducted with gel electrophoresis for the presence of a specific ORF7a deletion within the ""BE.9"" lineages. A simple intercalating dye-based qPCR assay protocol was tested and optimized through the repositioning primers from the ARTIC v.4.1 amplicon panel, which was able to distinguish between ""BE.9"" and ""non-BE.9"" lineages, particularly BQ.1. Three ML models were trained with the melting curve of the intercalating dye-based qPCR that enabled lineage assignment with elevated accuracy. Amongst them, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model had the best performance and after fine-tuning showed ~96.52% (333/345) accuracy in comparison to the test dataset. The integration of these methods may allow rapid assessment of emerging variants and increment molecular surveillance strategies, especially in resource-limited settings. Our approach not only provides a cost-effective alternative to complement traditional sequencing methods but also offers a scalable analytical solution for enhanced monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants for other laboratories through easy-to-train ML algorithms, thus contributing to global efforts in pandemic control.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

Insertions or deletions of nucleotides not divisible by three shift the reading frames, resulting in significantly different protein sequences. These events are disruptive but can also create variability important for evolution. Previous studies suggest that genetic code and gene sequences evolve to minimize frameshift effects, maintaining similar physicochemical properties to their reference proteins. Here, we focused on tandem repeat sequences, known as frameshift hotspots. Using cutting-edge bioinformatics tools, we compared reference and frameshifted protein sequences within tandem repeats across 50 prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteomes. Our analysis revealed several intriguing sequence-structure-function correlations. We showed that in contrast to the general tendency, frameshifts within these regions, especially with short repeats, lead to significant changes: increased hydrophobicity and arginine content, new aggregation-prone and transmembrane regions. Overall, frameshifts have stronger effects on tandem repeat regions compared to non-repetitive sequences, and therefore can be a primary cause of altered functions, cellular localization, and the development of various pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625

Yet the reasons behind these disparities remain poorly understood. While recent research has linked gut microbes to these variations, the role of oral bacteria, a main port of entry for the coronavirus, remains unexplored.We investigated the relationship between oral microbiota and COVID-19 mortality rates across eightcountries. Raw sequencing data of 16S rRNA regions from oral microbiota in 244 healthy subjects from eight countries were obtained from public databases. We employed a generalized linear model (GLM) to predict COVID-19 mortality rates using oral microbiota composition. GLM revealed that high abundances of hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producing bacteria, particularly Treponema, predicted low COVID-19 mortality rates with a markedly low p-value. Unsupervised clustering using a combination of LIGER and t-SNE yielded four oral microbiome ""orotypes."" Orotypes enriched in H2S-producing bacteria coincided with lower mortality rates, while orotypes harboring Haemophilus or Rothia were associated with increased vulnerability. To validate our findings, we analyzed influenza mortality data from the same countries, observing similar protective trends. Our findings suggest that oral bacteria-produced H2S may serve as a critical initial defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection.H2S from oral bacteria may prevent infection through antiviral activity, blocking ACE2 receptors, suppressing cytokines, and boosting antioxidants. This highlights the oral microbiomes role in COVID-19 outcomes and suggests new preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Prior studies suggest high frequencies of infralesional lower motor abnormalities in muscles that are potential targets for nerve transfer surgery, a procedure that has the potential to restore upper limb function. Methods: In this prospective, two-center cohort study, we used multipoint stimulation motor unit number estimation (MPS-MUNE) to evaluate the number of motor units in clinically relevant infralesional muscles, including the predominantly C7-innervated anconeus and the predominantly C8-innervated extensor indicis (EI) in 15 individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (26 limbs) and 17 healthy controls. Results: Both CMAP and MUNE values were significantly lower (p < 0.05) for those with cervical spinal cord injury (EI CMAP: 2.0 mV +/- 1.57, EI MUNE: 33 +/- 30.5, Anconeus CMAP:2.7 mV +/- 1.9, Anconeus MUNE: 39 +/- 50.6) versus controls (EI CMAP: 6.6mV +/- 1.0, EI MUNE:137 +/- 33.9, Anconeus CMAP:6.6 mV +/- 1.3, Anconeus MUNE: 146 +/- 42.3). The test-retest reliability as measured by intraclass correlation coefficient and confidence interval (CI) for the EI and anconeus were 0.84 (CI: 0.45-0.95) and 0.78 (CI: 0.36-0.93), respectively. Discussion: This study shows significant loss of infralesional motor units after cervical spinal cord injury. We demonstrate the potential utility of MPS-MUNE for evaluating the health of LMNs. The LMN abnormalities observed underscore the significance of this approach to evaluating potential targets for nerve transfer surgery for the restoration of upper limb function.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

Here, we report on 57 individuals, 52 probands and 5 affected family members, with protein truncating variants (n=36), (micro)deletions (n=20) or an inversion (n=1) affecting ZFHX4 with variable developmental delay and intellectual disability, distinctive facial characteristics, morphological abnormalities of the central nervous system, behavioral alterations, short stature, hypotonia, and occasionally cleft palate and anterior segment dysgenesis. The phenotypes associated with 8q21.11 microdeletions and ZFHX4 intragenic loss-of-function variants largely overlap, identifying ZFHX4 as the main driver for the microdeletion syndrome, although leukocyte-derived DNA shows a mild common methylation profile for (micro)deletions only. We identify ZFHX4 as a transcription factor that is increasingly expressed during human brain development and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, ZFHX4 interacting factors identified via IP-MS in neural progenitor cells, suggest an important role for ZFHX4 in cellular and developmental pathways, especially during histone modifications, cytosolic transport and development. Additionally, using CUT&RUN, we observed that ZFHX4 binds with the promoter regions of genes with crucial roles in embryonic, neuron and axon development. Since loss-of-function variants in ZFHX4 are found with consistent dysmorphic facial features, we investigated whether the disruption of zfhx4 causes craniofacial abnormalities in zebrafish. First-generation (F0) zfhx4 crispant zebrafish, (mosaic) mutant for zfhx4 loss-of-function variants, have significantly shorter Meckels cartilages and smaller ethmoid plates compared to control zebrafish. Furthermore, behavioral assays show a decreased movement frequency in the zfhx4 crispant zebrafish in comparison with control zebrafish larvae. Although further research is needed, our in vivo work suggests a role for zfhx4 in facial skeleton patterning, palatal development and behavior.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

Based on these studies, we find that estimates of attributable mortality range from 10 to over 271,000 deaths, depending on timescale, spatial extent, climate hazard, and cause of death. We calculate that this loss of life amounts to up to US$ trillions in monetary value when using standard valuation approaches. So far, end-to-end attribution studies capture only a small fraction of the presumed global burden of climate change, with few studies addressing infectious and non-communicable diseases, and no subnational or event-specific studies focused on a location outside of Europe and the United States.

A key challenge in applying machine learning to high-dimensional data is deriving important features in an interpretable manner to provide meaningful insights into the underlying biological mechanisms

We developed a class-based directional feature importance (CLIFI) metric for decision tree methods and demonstrated its use for the The Cancer Genome Atlas proteomics data. We incorporated this metric into four algorithms, Random Forest (RF), LAtent VAriable Stochastic Ensemble of Trees (LAVASET), and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), and a new extension incorporating the LAVA step into GBDTs (LAVABOOST). Both LAVA methods incorporate topological information from protein interactions into the decision function.

The different models performance in classifying 28 cancers resulted in F1-scores of 93% (RF), 92% (LAVASET), 89% (LAVABOOST) and 86% (GBDT), with no method outperforming all others for individual cancer type prediction. The CLIFI metric allowed the visualisation of the model decision making functions, and the distributions indicated heterogeneity in several proteins (MYH11, ER, BCL2) for different cancer types (including brain glioma, breast, kidney, thyroid and prostate cancer).

We have developed an integrated, directional feature importance metric for multi-class decision tree-based classification models that facilitates interpretable feature importance assessment. The CLIFI metric can be used in conjunction with incorporating topological information into the decision functions of models to add inductive bias for improved interpretability.

The lack of robust in vitro models to study early tumor progression has hindered the development of effective therapies. Here, we develop engineered GBM organoids (eGBOs) harboring GBM subtype-specific oncogenic mutations to investigate the underlying transcriptional regulation of tumor progression. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses revealed that these mutations disrupt normal neurodevelopment gene regulatory networks resulting in changes in cellular composition and spatial organization. Upon xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice, eGBOs form tumors that recapitulate the transcriptional and spatial landscape of human GBM samples. Integrative single-cell trajectory analysis of both eGBO-derived tumor cells and patient GBM samples revealed the dynamic gene expression changes in developmental cell states underlying tumor progression. This analysis of eGBOs provides an important validation of engineered cancer organoid models and demonstrates their utility as a model of GBM tumorigenesis for future preclinical development of therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625

Academic publishers are adapting to the transformative role of AI chatbots in producing or facilitating scientific research. This study aimed to examine the policies established by scientific, technical, and medical academic publishers for defining and regulating the responsible authors use of AI chatbots.

MethodsThis study performed a cross-sectional audit on the publicly available policies of 163 academic publishers, indexed as members of the International Association of the Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM). Data extraction of publicly available policies on the webpages of all STM academic publishers was performed independently in duplicate with content analysis reviewed by a third contributor (September 2023 - December 2023). Data was categorized into policy elements, such as  proofreading and  image generation. Counts and percentages of  yes (i.e., permitted),  no, and  N/A were established for each policy element.

ResultsA total of 56/163 (34.4%) STM academic publishers had a publicly available policy guiding the authors use of AI chatbots. No policy allowed authorship accreditations for AI chatbots (or other generative technology). Most (49/56 or 87.5%) required specific disclosure of AI chatbot use. Four policies/publishers placed a complete ban on the use of AI tools by authors.

ConclusionsOnly a third of STM academic publishers had publicly available policies as of December 2023. A re-examination of all STM members in 12-18 months may uncover evolving approaches toward AI chatbot use with more academic publishers having a policy.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons. This work has interesting technical applications, and provides a biologically-inspired model of cortical memory.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625

Disease progression and failure to respond to anthracycline based chemotherapy, standard first-line treatment, is associated with poor patient outcomes. To address this, we investigated the contribution of STS cancer stem cells (STS-CSCs) to doxorubicin resistance. We identified a positive correlation between CSC abundance and doxorubicin IC50 in resistant cell lines. We investigated if a common genetic signature across STS-CSCs could be targeted. Utilizing patient derived samples from five sarcoma subtypes we identified Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for H3K27 methylation as being enriched in the CSC population. EZH2 activity and a shared epigenetic profile was observed across subtypes. Targeting of EZH2 using Tazemetostat, an FDA approved inhibitor specifically ablated the STS-CSC population. Treatment of doxorubicin resistant cell lines with tazemetostat resulted in a decrease in the STS-CSC population. Further, co-treatment was not only synergistic in the parent cell lines, but restored chemosensitivity in doxorubicin resistant lines. These data confirm the presence of shared genetic programs across distinct subtypes of CSC-STS that can be therapeutically targeted.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the reemergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024.

MethodsIn this study, we combined OROV genomic, molecular, and serological data from Brazil from 1 January 2015 to 29 June 2024, along with in vitro and in vivo characterization. Molecular screening data included 93 patients with febrile illness between January 2023 and February 2024 from the Amazonas State. Genomic data comprised two genomic OROV sequences from patients. Serological data were obtained from neutralizing antibody tests comparing the prototype OROV strain BeAn 19991 and the 2024 epidemic strain. Epidemiological data included aggregated cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 1 January 2014 to 29 June 2024.

FindingsIn 2024, autochthonous OROV infections were detected in previously non-endemic areas across all five Brazilian regions. Cases were reported in 19 of 27 federal units, with 83.2% (6,895 of 8,284) of infections in Northern Brazil and a nearly 200-fold increase in incidence compared to reported cases over the last decade. We detected OROV RNA in 10.8% (10 of 93) of patients with febrile illness between December 2023 and May 2024 in Amazonas. We demonstrate that the 2023-2024 epidemic was caused by a novel OROV reassortant that replicated approximately 100-fold higher titers in mammalian cells compared to the prototype strain. The 2023-2024 OROV reassortant displayed plaques earlier than the prototype, produced 1.7 times more plaques, and plaque sizes were 2.5 larger compared to the prototype. Furthermore, serum collected in 2016 from previously OROV-infected individuals showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralizing capacity against the reassortment strain compared to the prototype.

InterpretationThese findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to a better understanding of the 2023-2024 OROV reemergence. The recent increased incidence may be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new reassortant virus that also evades previous immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

Robust perception is thought to be facilitated by nonlinear response properties, including temporal adaptation (reduced responses to re-peated stimuli) and contrast gain (shift in the contrast response function with pre-exposure to a stimulus). Temporal adaptation and contrast gain have both been shown to aid object recognition, however, their joint effect on perceptual and neural responses remains unclear. Here, we collected behavioural measurements and electrocorticography (EEG) data while human participants (both sexes) classified objects embedded within temporally repeated noise patterns, whereby object contrast was varied. Our findings reveal an in-teraction effect, with increased categorization performance as a result of temporal adaptation for higher but not lower contrast stimuli. This increase in behavioral performance after adaptation is associated with more pronounced contrast-dependent modulation of evoked neural responses, as well as better decoding of object information from EEG activity. To elucidate the neural computations underlying these effects, we endowed deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) with various temporal adaptation mechanisms, including intrinsic suppression and temporal divisive normalisation. We demonstrate that incorporating a biologically-inspired contrast response function to modify temporal adaptation helps DCNNs to accurately capture human behaviour and neural activation profiles. Moreover, we find that networks with multiplicative temporal adaptation mechanisms, such as divisive normalization, show higher robustness against spatial shifts in the inputs compared to DCNNs employing additive mechanisms. Overall, we reveal how interaction effects between nonlinear response properties influence human perception in challenging viewing contexts and investigate potential computations that mediate these effects.

Significance statementHumans are able to perceive the environment even when viewing conditions are suboptimal. This robust perception has been linked to nonlinear neural processing of incoming visual information. Here, we examine the joint impact of two neural response properties, temporal adaptation and contrast gain, during object recognition, demonstrating interaction effects on categorization performance and in evoked neural responses. Using convolutional neural networks, we investigate various temporal adaptation mechanisms mediating the neural responses and perception, demonstrating that introducing contrast-dependent modulation of the unit activations captures human behaviour and neural object representations. Our findings shed light on how neural response properties give rise to robust perception and offer a framework to study the underlying neural dynamics and their impact on perception.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625

In neurons, mitochondrial lactate reported blood lactate levels with high fidelity. The exchange of lactate across the inner mitochondrial membrane was found to be mediated by a high affinity H+-coupled transport system involving the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC. Assessment of electron transport chain activity and determination of lactate flux showed that mitochondria are tonic lactate producers, a phenomenon driven by energization and stimulated by hypoxia. We conclude that an overflow mechanism caps the redox level of mitochondria, while saving energy in the form of lactate.

ObjectivesTo determine immune-cell-specific transcriptomic profiles associated with IPF mortality.

MethodsWe profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 18 participants [University of South Florida: IPF, COVID-19, post-COVID-19 Interstitial Lung Disease (Post-COVID-19 ILD), controls] by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and identified 16 immune-cell-specific transcriptomic profiles. The Scoring Algorithm of Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS) was used to calculate Up-scores based on these 16 gene profiles. Their association with outcomes was investigated in peripheral blood, Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) and lung tissue of N=416 IPF patients from six cohorts. Findings were validated in an independent IPF, PBMC scRNA-seq dataset (N=38).

Measurements and main resultsCox-regression models demonstrated that 230 genes from CD14+CD163-HLA-DRlow circulating monocytes predicted IPF mortality [Pittsburgh (p=0.02), Chicago (p=0.003)]. PBMC proportions of CD14+CD163-HLA-DRlow monocytes were higher in progressive versus stable IPF (Yale, 0.13{+/-}0.05 versus 0.09{+/-}0.05, p=0.034). Receiving operating characteristic identified a 230 gene, Up-score >41.84 (Pittsburgh) predictive of mortality in Chicago (HR: 6.58, 95%CI: 2.15-20.13, p=0.001) and in pooled analysis of BAL cohorts (HR: 2.20, 95%CI: 1.44-3.37, p=0.0003). High-risk patients had decreased expression of the T-cell co-stimulatory genes CD28, ICOS, ITK and LCK (Pittsburgh and Chicago, p<0.01). 230 gene-up-scores negatively correlated with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) in IPF lung tissues (LGRC, rho=-0.2, p=0.02). Results were replicated using a subset of 13 genes from the 230-gene signature (pooled PBMC cohorts - HR: 5.34, 95%CI: 2.83-10.06, p<0.0001).

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

HighlightsPromoter editing generates unimodal setpoints from a single synthetic promoter

DIAL setpoints are tuned by the length of an excisable spacer within the promoter

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1723414068625

Occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus (58.3%) and Escherichia coli (45.8%) in skin and stool samples were respectively determined based on cultural and morphological characteristics. Conventional biochemical tests were carried out on the 14 and 10 presumptive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolates and then 10 and 8 presumptive isolates were detected respectively. The antibacterial activity of the test agent was determined using the agar well diffusion technique; five different concentrations (20% v/v, 40% v/v, 60% v/v, 80% v/v, and 100% v/v) of the test agents were evaluated against the bacterial isolates. The earwax showed antibacterial activity against both isolates (except the 20% v/v for Staphylococcus aureus) at all concentrations used with antibacterial activity directly proportional to earwax concentration and a better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (zone of inhibition 20mm) aureus than Escherichia coli. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out on the 10(41.7%) and 8(33.3%) presumptive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli respectively based on Kirby Bauer method.

For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625

Here we show that language models trained on tokens generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625
"The Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect: Pupils size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation","10.1101/2024.06.27.599713","biorxiv",102.08,0,0,0,89.03,"Schaefer, M.; Mathot, S.; Lundqvist, M.; Lundstrom, J.

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625

Here, we estimate biological age of 11 organs from 44,526 individuals in the UK Biobank using an antibody-based proteomics platform to model disease and mortality risk. Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimers disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements. Remarkably, the accrual of aged organs progressively increases mortality risk while a youthful brain and immune system are uniquely associated with disease-free longevity. These findings support the use of plasma proteins for monitoring organ health and the efficacy of drugs targeting organ aging disease.","NA","biorxiv",1723414068625
