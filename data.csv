Yet, deciphering their molecular language - that is, understanding how protein sequences and structures encode and determine biological functions - remains a cornerstone challenge in modern biology. Here, we introduce Evola, an 80 billion frontier protein-language generative model designed to decode the molecular language of proteins. By integrating information from protein sequences, structures, and user queries, Evola generates precise and contextually nuanced insights into protein function. A key innovation of Evola lies in its training on an unprecedented AI-generated dataset: 546 million protein question-answer pairs and 150 billion word tokens, designed to reflect the immense complexity and functional diversity of proteins. Post-pretraining, Evola integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine the model based on preference signals and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for external knowledge incorporation, improving response quality and relevance. To evaluate its performance, we propose a novel framework, Instructional Response Space (IRS), demonstrating that Evola delivers expert-level insights, advancing research in proteomics and functional genomics while shedding light on the molecular logic encoded in proteins.

The epidemic remains uncontrolled, with spillbacks into poultry, wild birds and other mammals including humans. Here, we present molecular and virological evidence that the cattle B3.13 genotype H5N1 viruses rapidly accumulated adaptations in polymerase genes that enabled better replication in bovine cells, as well as cells of other mammalian species including humans and pigs. We find evidence of several mammalian adaptations gained early in the evolution of these viruses in cattle including PB2 M631L, which is found in all cattle sequences, and PA K497R, which is found in the majority. Structurally, PB2 M631L maps to the polymerase-ANP32 interface, an essential host factor for viral genome replication. We show this mutation adapts the virus to co-opt bovine ANP32 proteins and thereby enhances virus replication in bovine and primary human airway cells. Importantly, we show that ongoing evolution during 2024 in the PB2 gene, including a convergently arising D740N substitution, further increases polymerase activity in a range of mammalian cells. Thus, the continued circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle allows virus adaption improving replicative ability in cattle and increasing zoonotic spillover risk.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

It is debated whether M1 actively participates in generating the activity pattern or it only passively reflects patterned inputs. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this learned activity pattern causally drives the learned movement. We addressed these issues using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with holographic optogenetic stimulation of specific ensembles of M1 L2/3 neurons in mice engaged in a skilled lever-press task. We briefly and synchronously stimulated ~20 neurons whose activity onset in voluntary trials precedes movement onsets. This stimulation, despite lacking temporal patterns, induced movements that resembled the learned movement, while producing spatiotemporal activity patterns in other M1 neurons not directly stimulated that resembled the activity during the voluntary learned movement. Trial-by-trial variability of optogenetically triggered population activity in the non-target neurons correlated with the variability in the induced movements. These trial-by-trial variabilities were predicted by the initial state of M1 population activity immediately preceding the optogenetic stimulation. Stimulation of the neurons whose activity followed voluntary movement onsets failed to induce the learned movement. Thus, the learned activity pattern in M1 L2/3 can be generated when the M1 network is prepared at the optimal initial state and receives precise triggering inputs, supporting the active role of M1 in learned activity generation. The resulting activity pattern then causally drives the learned movement.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

ME/CFS symptoms can range from mild to severe, and include immune system effects alongside incapacitating fatigue and post-exertional disease exacerbation. In this study, we examined immunological profiles of people living with ME/CFS by flow cytometry, focusing on cytotoxic cells, to determine whether people with mild/moderate (n= 43) or severe ME/CFS (n=53) expressed different immunological markers. We found that people with mild/moderate ME/CFS had increased expression of cytotoxic effector molecules alongside enhanced proportions of early-immunosenescence cells, determined by the CD28-CD57- phenotype. In contrast, people with severe ME/CFS had higher proportions of activated circulating lymphocytes, determined by CD69+ and CD38+ expression, and expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-17, following stimulation in vitro. These changes were consistent across different cell types including CD8+ T cells, mucosal associated invariant T cells and Natural Killer cells, indicating generalised altered cytotoxic responses across the innate and adaptive immune system . These immunological differences likely reflect different disease pathogenesis mechanisms occurring in the two clinical groups, and opening up opportunities for the development of prognostic markers and stratified treatments.","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

In this work, we have characterized the transport and accumulation of different tattoo inks in the lymphatic system using a murine model. Upon quick lymphatic drainage, we observed that macrophages mainly capture the ink in the lymph node (LN). An initial inflammatory reaction at local and systemic levels follows ink capture. Notably, the inflammatory process is maintained over time as we observed clear signs of inflammation in the draining LN two months following tattooing. In addition, the capture of ink by macrophages was associated with the induction of apoptosis in both human and murine models. Furthermore, the ink accumulated in the LN altered the immune response against a COVID-19 vaccine. We observed a reduced antibody response following vaccination with a mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which was associated with a decreased expression of the Spike protein in macrophages in the draining LN. Considering the unstoppable trend of tattooing in the population, our results are crucial in informing the toxicology programs, policymakers, and the general public regarding the potential risk of the tattooing practice associated with an altered immune response.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Objective: The primary objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the global prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes and symptoms in individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, while the secondary objective is to assess risk factors for long COVID in the same population. Data Sources: Studies on long COVID published from July 5, 2021, to May 29, 2024, searched from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were used for this systematic review. Supplemental updates to the original search period were made. Study Selection: There were four inclusion criteria: (1) human study population with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis; (2) appropriate index diagnosis date; (3) outcome must include either prevalence, risk factors, duration, or symptoms of long COVID; and (4) follow-up time of at least two months after the index date. The exclusion criteria were: (1) non-human study population; (1) case studies or reviews; (2) studies with imaging, molecular, and/or cellular testing as primary results; (3) studies with specific populations such as healthcare workers, residents of nursing homes, and/or those living in long-term care facilities; and (4) studies that did not meet the sample size threshold needed to estimate overall prevalence with margin of error of 0.05. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two screeners independently performed screenings and data extraction, and decision conflicts were collectively resolved. The data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis framework with a DerSimonian-Laird inverse variance weighted estimator. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary estimand (target population parameter of interest) was the prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes among individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, and the secondary estimand was effect sizes corresponding to ten common risk factors of long COVID in the same population. Results: A total of 442 studies were included in this mega-systematic review, and 429 were meta-analyzed for various endpoints, avoiding duplicate estimates from the same study. Of the 442 studies, 17.9% of the studies have a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity is evident among meta-analyzed studies, where the I2 statistic is nearly 100% in studies that estimate overall prevalence. Global estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID was 36% among COVID-19 positive individuals (95% confidence interval [CI] 33%-40%) estimated from 144 studies. Geographical variation was observed in the estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID: Asia at 35% (95% CI 25%-46%), Europe at 39% (95% CI 31%-48%), North America at 30% (95% CI 24%-38%), and South America at 51% (95% CI 35%-66%). Stratifying by follow-up duration, the estimated pooled prevalence for individuals with longer follow-up periods of 1 to 2 years (47% [95% CI 37%-57%]) compared to those with follow-up times of less than 1 year (35% [95% CI 31%-39%]) had overlapping CI and were therefore not statistically distinguishable. Top five most prevalent long COVID subtypes among COVID-19 positive cases were respiratory at 20% (95% CI 14%-28%) estimated from 31 studies, general fatigue at 20% (95% CI 18%-23%) estimated from 121 studies, psychological at 18% (95% CI 11%-28%) estimated from 10 studies, neurological at 16% (95% CI 8%-30%) estimated from 23 studies, and dermatological at 12% (95% CI 8%-17%) estimated from 10 studies. The most common symptom based on estimated prevalence was memory problems estimated at 11% (95% CI 7%-19%) meta-analyzed from 12 studies. The three strongest risk factors for long COVID were being unvaccinated for COVID-19, pre-existing comorbidity, and female sex. Individuals with any of these risk factors had higher odds of having long COVID with pooled estimated odds ratios of 2.34 (95% CI 1.49-3.67) meta-analyzed from 6 studies, 1.59 (95% CI 1.28-1.97) from 13 studies, and 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.92) from 22 studies, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This study shows long COVID is globally prevalent in the COVID-19 positive population with highly varying estimates. The prevalence of long COVID persists over extended follow-up, with a high burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection. Our findings highlight long COVID and its subtypes as a continuing health challenge worldwide. The heterogeneity of the estimates across populations and geographical regions argues for the need for carefully designed follow-up with representative studies across the world.","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

Recently, recurrent de novo variants in the U4 RNA, transcribed from the RNU4-2 gene, and in at least two other RNU genes were discovered to cause neurodevelopmental disorder. We detected inherited and de novo heterozygous variants in RNU4-2 (n.18_19insA and n.56T>C) and in four out of the five RNU6 paralogues (n.55_56insG and n.56_57insG) in 135 individuals from 62 families with non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a rare form of hereditary blindness. We show that these variants are recurrent among RP families and invariably cluster in close proximity within the three-way junction (between stem-I, the 5' stem-loop and stem-II) of the U4/U6 duplex, affecting its natural conformation. Interestingly, this region binds to numerous splicing factors of the tri-snRNP complex including PRPF3, PRPF8 and PRPF31, previously associated with RP as well. The U4 and U6 variants identified seem to affect snRNP biogenesis, namely the U4/U6 di-snRNP, which is an assembly intermediate of the tri-snRNP. Based on the number of positive cases observed, deleterious variants in RNU4-2 and in RNU6 paralogues could be a significant cause of isolated or dominant RP, accounting for up to 1.2% of all undiagnosed RP cases. This study highlights the role of non-coding genes in rare Mendelian disorders and uncovers pleiotropy in RNU4-2, where different variants underlie neurodevelopmental disorder and RP.","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

Here, we extend a new class of biosensors for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, the pYtag system, to visualize endogenous RTK activity in Drosophila. We build biosensors for three Drosophila RTKs that function across developmental stages and tissues. By characterizing Torso::pYtag during terminal patterning in the early embryo, we find that Torso activity differs from downstream ERK activity in two surprising ways: Torso activity is narrowly restricted to the poles but produces a broader gradient of ERK, and Torso activity decreases over developmental time while ERK activity is sustained. This decrease in Torso activity is driven by ERK pathway-dependent negative feedback. Our results suggest an updated model of terminal patterning where a narrow domain of Torso activity, tuned in amplitude by negative feedback, locally activates signaling effectors which diffuse through the syncytial embryo to form the ERK gradient. Altogether, this work highlights the usefulness of pYtags for investigating receptor-level regulation of developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

In plants, centromeres are loaded with CENH3-variant nucleosomes, which direct kinetochore formation and spindle microtubule interaction. Plant centromeres are frequently composed of megabase-scale satellite repeat arrays, or retrotransposon nests. In monocentric genomes, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, extended regions of pericentromeric heterochromatin surround the CENH3-occupied satellite arrays. A zone of suppressed meiotic crossover recombination contains the centromere and extends into the pericentromeres. Here, we explore how Arabidopsis natural genetic variation influences centromere-proximal crossover frequency, and segregation distortion through meiosis, when homologous centromeres are structurally heterozygous. Results: We used fluorescent crossover reporters to survey the effect of natural variation on centromere-proximal recombination in twelve F1 hybrids, capturing Arabidopsis Eurasian and relict diversity. The majority of F1 hybrids showed either elevated or suppressed centromere-proximal crossovers (49 of 60), relative to inbreds. We relate hybrid crossover frequencies to patterns of centromeric structural variation, and in a subset of accessions, to epigenetic patterns of CENH3 loading and DNA methylation. The fluorescent reporters also allow segregation distortion through meiosis to be compared between inbred and hybrid strains. We observed a minority of hybrids (18 of 60) with distorted segregation through meiosis compared to inbreds, with and without simultaneous change to centromere-proximal crossover frequency. Conclusions: We reveal a complex relationship between centromere structural variation, epigenetic state, crossover recombination, and segregation distortion. We propose a model for how Arabidopsis centromere structural heterozygosity may cause segregation distortion during female meiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Migration of i-cells is controlled by sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed, surprisingly, that the newly regenerated individual derives nearly exclusively from i-cell progeny rather than from recycled somatic cells, as seen in other hydrozoans. Given the similarity of this phenomenon to embryogenesis, we propose that the ability of Hydractinia cell aggregates to regenerate is a side effect of the animal's i-cell-mediated development.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Previous studies have demonstrated that one dose of psilocybin leads to persisting neural and behavioral changes. The durability of psilocybin's effects suggests that there are likely alterations of gene expression at the transcriptional level. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the dorsal medial frontal cortex of male and female mice. Samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 24, or 72 hours after psilocybin or ketamine administration and from control animals. At baseline, major excitatory and GABAergic cell types selectively express particular serotonin receptor transcripts. The psilocybin-evoked differentially expressed genes in excitatory neurons were involved in synaptic plasticity, which were distinct from genes enriched in GABAergic neurons that contribute to mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. The effect of psilocybin on gene expression was time-dependent, including an early phase at 1-2 hours followed by a late phase at 72 hours of transcriptional response after administration. Ketamine administration produced transcriptional changes that show a high degree of correlation to those induced by psilocybin. Collectively, the results reveal that psilocybin produces time-dependent and cell-type specific changes in gene expression in the medial frontal cortex, which may underpin the drug's long-term effects on neural circuits and behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

However, as single-cell FMs begin to train on increasingly large corpora, significant privacy and ethical concerns arise. Moreover, unlike text data, single-cell data is unordered and exhibits a unique tabular structure that most existing single-cell FMs overlook. In this study, we propose Tabula, a privacy-preserving and tabular-structure aware FM designed with federated learning (FL) and tabular modeling. Tabula combines the advantages of FMs and FL, enabling collaborative model training across multiple clients without compromising data privacy. In contrast to earlier single-cell FMs-which treat single-cell data like natural language (viewing cells as ""words"" defined by genes)-Tabula introduces a novel pretraining strategy that explicitly models the tabular structure of single-cell data. Extensive experimental results show that Tabula outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks (including cell type annotation, gene imputation, gene perturbation, multi-batch integration, and multi-omics integration) while requiring only half the data for pretraining and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, Tabula accurately reveals pairwise and even combinatorial regulatory logic across diverse biological systems, including hematopoiesis, pancreatic endogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiogenesis. Thus, Tabula provides a new foundation model that explicitly incorporates the tabular nature of single-cell data alongside FL, paving the way for creating a ""virtual cell"" for human health under critical privacy preservation.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

The ability to orient towards sounds is a key component of social interactions, yet auditory spatial attention remains relatively understudied in ASD, despite some prior research indicating differences in this domain. Here, we investigate the neural signatures associated with passive auditory spatial attention in children with ASD (n = 21, ages 6-17) relative to age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children (n = 31), using source-localized magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened passively, while watching a silenced movie, to non-social auditory stimuli designed to either remain lateralized to one hemifield (""stay"" trials), or to change in location from one side to the contralateral hemifield (""jump"" trials). Linear mixed effect modeling showed decreased cortical activation in the auditory cortex in the ASD group in response to jump trials, relative to the TD group. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed increased alpha-band functional connectivity in the ASD group between auditory cortex seeds and frontoparietal regions known to be recruited during auditory spatial attention. Right prefrontal alpha-band connectivity estimates were associated with worse behaviorally assessed auditory processing scores and increased ASD symptomatology. Our results align with the hypothesis that auditory spatial attention generally, and specifically orientation to sounds even when experienced passively, differs in ASD individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

While we have substantial knowledge of the molecular parts and rules of cytoskeletal assembly, we know less about how structures are remodeled, for example to interconvert centrioles from the ciliary base to the centrosome. To study this in an evolutionary context we use the chytrid fungus, Rhizoclosmatium globosum, a member of the zoosporic fungi which have centrioles and cilia, lost in other fungal lineages. Chytrids undergo reorganization of their microtubule cytoskeleton as they cycle from zoospore to multinucleated coenocyte. We use comparative bioinformatics, RNA sequencing, and expansion microscopy to map the microtubule cytoskeleton over the chytrid lifecycle. We find that when zoospores encyst, cilia are retracted into the cytoplasm and degraded, and centrioles detach but are protected from degradation. A shortened proximal centriole then forms the mitotic centrosome and ultimately elongates to form cilia at the end of the mitotic cycles, driven by a conserved transcriptional program. Thus, structural remodeling of the chytrid centriole is coupled temporally to ciliated stages rather than mitotic cycles, which may serve as a mechanism to tune microtubule organization to meet the needs of different lifecycle stages.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Here, we address this question using a multi-omic approach that integrates super-resolution imaging and metabolic analyses to profile macrophages from a mouse model of mitochondrial disease arising from a heteroplasmic mutation (m.5019A>G) in the mitochondrial tRNA for alanine. These m.5019A>G macrophages exhibit defects in respiratory chain complexes and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) due to decreased intra-mitochondrial translation. To adapt to this metabolic stress, mitochondrial fusion, reductive glutamine metabolism, and aerobic glycolysis are all increased. Upon inflammatory activation, type I interferon (IFN-I) release is enhanced, while the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxylipins are restrained in m.5019A>G macrophages. Finally, an in vivo endotoxemia model using m.5019A>G mice reveal elevated IFN-I levels and sickness behaviour.

We found that signal correlations predict future noise correlations, suggesting that stimulus-induced co-activation leads to increased effective connectivity between neuron pairs. Moreover, simple linear network models were able to account for the observed temporal dependencies between signal and noise correlations, but only if both Hebbian-like plasticity and stochastic changes of either inputs or recurrent synapses contribute to representational drift. In conclusion, our findings suggest that continuous sensory input-driven Hebbian-like plasticity can balance ongoing stochastic synaptic changes, thereby preventing the network's functional degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Characterising key epidemiological parameters for H5N1 is critical should this become widespread.

AimTo identify and estimate critical epidemiological parameters for H5N1 from past and current outbreaks, and to compare their characteristics with human influenza subtypes.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews reporting parameter estimates from primary data or meta-analyses. To address gaps, we searched Google Scholar for studies of any design providing relevant estimates. We estimated the basic reproduction number for the outbreak in the US and estimated the serial interval using data from previous household clusters in Indonesia. We also applied a branching process model to simulate transmission chain size and duration to assess if simulated transmission patterns align with observed dynamics.

ResultsFrom 32 studies, we identified H5N1s epidemiological profile as having lower transmissibility (R0 < 0.2) but higher severity compared to human subtypes. Evidence suggests H5N1 has longer incubation ([~]4 days vs [~]2 days) and serial intervals ([~]6 days vs [~]3 days) than human subtypes, impacting transmission dynamics. Key gaps remain regarding latent and infectious periods.

ConclusionsWe characterised critical epidemiological parameters for H5N1 infection. The current U.S. outbreak shows lower pathogenicity but similar transmissibility compared to prior outbreaks. Longer incubation and serial intervals may enhance contact tracing feasibility. These estimates offer a baseline for monitoring changes in H5N1 epidemiology.","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

Lsr2 is a nucleoid-associated protein that interacts with DNA in vivo and regulates many genes. Purified Lsr2 forms nucleoprotein filaments with DNA molecules leading to highly compacted DNA conformations. However, the physical mechanism underlying Lsr2-mediated DNA compaction, resulting in gene regulation, remains elusive. We employed a combination of biochemical assay, single-molecule imaging, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the governing principles of Lsr2-mediated DNA compaction. We show that, while Lsr2 alone undergoes phase separation, addition of DNA substantially lowers the required concentration for its phase separation. Strikingly, our single-molecule and simulation data establish that Lsr2 forms condensates with long stretches of AT-rich DNA, providing strong evidence for sequence-dependent co-condensation. This observation is contrary to the classical view of sequence-dependent binding of individual protein molecules to DNA, our findings rather suggest that protein-DNA co-condensates 'sense' the average binding energy landscape.

We look at whole-genome sequence data for three datasets to differentiate within field diversity in fields of similar size: one dataset from a newly sampled field population from the United Kingdom and two publicly available datasets from fields from the United States and Switzerland.

Inspection of population structure and diversity features, such as minor allele frequency distribution and clonality, show no within-field structure, the most abundant SNPs are present in low frequency, and European fields have higher clonality. Knowing that effectors play particularly important roles in (a)virulence, we specifically assess effector diversity characteristics. Whereas on a whole-genome scale, we can see separation of the populations at the regional scale, we do not find such separation for the effectors. Moreover, we find that multiple effector haplotypes can be found interspersed within the field and even occur within what has been considered clonal isolates or isolates from a single lesion.

Current analyses predominantly focus on identifying outliers in single genes that can be attributed to cis-acting variants within the gene locus. This approach overlooks causal variants with trans-acting effects on splicing transcriptome-wide, such as variants impacting spliceosome function. We present a transcriptomics-first method to diagnose individuals with rare diseases by examining transcriptome-wide patterns of splicing outliers.

Using splicing outlier detection methods (FRASER and FRASER2) we characterized splicing outliers from whole blood for 390 individuals from the Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR) and Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) consortia. We examined all samples for excess intron retention outliers in minor intron containing genes (MIGs). Minor introns, which make up about 0.5% of all introns in the human genome, are removed by small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in the minor spliceosome.

This approach identified five individuals with excess intron retention outliers in MIGs, all of which were found to harbor rare, biallelic variants in minor spliceosome snRNAs. Four individuals had rare, compound heterozygous variants in RNU4ATAC, which aided the reclassification of four variants. Additionally, one individual had rare, highly conserved, compound heterozygous variants in RNU6ATAC that may disrupt the formation of the catalytic spliceosome, suggesting a novel gene-disease candidate. These results demonstrate that examining RNA-sequencing data for transcriptome-wide signatures can increase the diagnostic yield of individuals with rare diseases, provide variant-to-function interpretation of spliceopathies, and uncover novel disease gene associations.","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

This suggests that different brain areas serve distinct functions supporting complex behavior. However, a common observation is that essentially anything that an animal senses, knows, or does can be decoded from neural activity in any brain area (4-6). If everything is everywhere, why have distinct areas? Here we show that the function of a brain area is more related to how different types of information are combined (formatted) in neural representations than merely whether that information is present. We compared two brain areas: the middle temporal area (MT), which is important for visual motion perception (7, 8), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which is linked to decision-making and reward expectation (9,10)). When monkeys based decisions on a combination of motion and reward information, both types of information were present in both areas. However, they were formatted differently: in MT, they were encoded separably, while in dlPFC, they were represented jointly in ways that reflected the monkeys' decision-making. A recurrent neural network (RNN) model that mirrored the information formatting in MT and dlPFC predicted that manipulating activity in these areas would differently affect decision-making. Consistent with model predictions, electrically stimulating MT biased choices midway between the visual motion stimulus and the preferred direction of the stimulated units (11), while stimulating dlPFC produced 'winner-take-all' decisions that sometimes reflected the visual motion stimulus and sometimes reflected the preference of the stimulated units, but never in between. These results are consistent with the tantalizing possibility that a modular structure enables complex behavior by flexibly reformatting information to accomplish behavioral goals.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are mosquito-borne diseases of major human concern. Differential diagnosis is complicated in children and adolescents by their overlapping clinical features (signs, symptoms, and complete blood count results). Few studies have directly compared the three diseases. We assessed clinical features of cases aged 2-17 years experiencing these diseases. Methods. We characterized 1,405 dengue, 517 chikungunya, and 522 Zika pediatric cases occurring from January 2006 through December 2023 in a Nicaraguan cohort study. Clinical records and laboratory results across the first 10 days of illness were examined from a primary care health center. All cases were laboratory-confirmed. Data were analyzed with generalized additive models, generalized mixed models, and machine learning models. Findings. The prevalence of many clinical features exhibited by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika cases differed substantially overall, by age, and by day of illness. Dengue cases were differentiated most by abdominal pain, leukopenia, nausea/vomiting, and basophilia; chikungunya cases were differentiated most by arthralgia and the absence of leukopenia and papular rash; and Zika cases were differentiated most by rash and lack of fever and lymphocytopenia. Dengue and chikungunya cases exhibited similar temperature dynamics during acute illness, and their temperatures were higher than Zika cases. Sixty-two laboratory-confirmed afebrile dengue cases, which would not be captured by any widely used international case definition, presented very similarly to afebrile Zika cases, though some exhibited warning signs of disease severity. The presence of arthralgia, the presence of basophilia, and the absence of fever were the most important model-based predictors of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, respectively. Interpretations. These findings substantially update our understanding of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in children while identifying various clinical features that could improve differential diagnoses. The occurrence of afebrile dengue warrants reconsideration of current case definitions. Funding.

Cardiovascular involvement is frequently reported in LC, often accompanied by a spectrum of related symptoms. Dysregulated lipid profiles and elevated atherogenic indices have been implicated in LC, yet no comprehensive systematic review and meta analysis has specifically addressed these biomarkers. Objective: This study aims to systematically evaluate atherogenic indices and lipid related biomarkers in individuals with LC compared to healthy controls. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and SciFinder from September to November 2024. Eligible studies reported lipid biomarker data for LC patients and controls, yielding 44 studies encompassing 8,114 participants (3,353 LC patients and 4,761 controls). Results: LC patients exhibited significant elevations in Castelli Risk Indexes 1 (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.199; 95% confidence intervals, CI: 0.087;0.312) and 2 (SMD = 0.202; 95% CI: 0.087;0.318). Atherogenic ratios, including triglyceride (TG)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (SMD = 0.294; 95% CI: 0.155;0.433), (TG + low-density lipoprotein, LDL + very low-density lipoprotein, VLDL)/(HDL + apolipoprotein, ApoA) (SMD = 0.264; 95% CI: 0.145;0.383), and ApoB/ApoA (SMD = 0.515; 95% CI: 0.233;0.796), were also significantly elevated. Additionally, LC patients demonstrated increased levels of LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and ApoB, alongside reduced HDL and ApoA levels. Results were free from publication bias. Conclusion: LC is associated with a pro atherogenic lipid profile, marked by increased atherogenic components and decreased protective lipid biomarkers. These findings highlight a potential heightened risk for cardiovascular complications in LC patients, warranting further clinical and mechanistic investigations.","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

Of the associated RNA-guided Cas effector nucleases, Cas12a2 stands out as the only known example exhibiting RNA-triggered collateral cleavage of three distinct substrates: single-stranded (ss)RNA, ssDNA, and double-stranded (ds)DNA. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of collateral cleavage, including which of these activities dominates during the Cas12a2-mediated immune response. Here, we show that Cas12a2 cleaves collateral DNA substrates over RNA substrates, even when RNA substrates are more abundant. This preference relies on a positive cooperativity mechanism that requires the four aromatic clamp residues that stabilize unwound and distorted dsDNA in the RuvC nuclease active site. Leveraging the cleavage preference for collateral DNA, we demonstrate that RNA-activated Cas12a2 can cleave a ssDNA probe in the presence of high concentrations of non-target RNA, while the RNA-targeting Cas13a cannot. This work thus reveals how Cas12a2 decides amongst different collateral cleavage substrates, with immediate implications for understanding Cas12a2-based immunity, improving molecular diagnostics, and laying a mechanistic foundation for future Cas12a2-based technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

We report a virtual spatial navigation task designed to test the impact of different levels and types of uncertainty about reward on place cell populations. When the reward location changed on a trial-by-trial basis, inducing expected uncertainty, a greater proportion of place cells followed along, and the reward and the track end became anchors of a warped spatial metric. When the reward location then unexpectedly moved, the fraction of reward place cells that followed was greater when starting from a state of expected, compared to low, uncertainty. Overall, we show that different forms of potentially interacting uncertainty generate remapping in parallel, task-relevant, reference frames.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

In contrast to somatic tissues, mutations driving clonal expansions in spermatogonia (CES) are also transmitted to the next generation. This results in an effective increase of de novo mutation rate for CES drivers. CES was originally discovered through extreme recurrence of de novo mutations causing Apert syndrome. Here, we develop a systematic approach to discover CES drivers as hotspots of human de novo mutation. Our analysis of 54,715 trios ascertained for rare conditions, 6,065 control trios and population variation from 807,162 mostly healthy individuals identifies genes manifesting rates of de novo mutations inconsistent with plausible models of disease ascertainment. We propose 15 genes hypermutable at loss-of-function (LoF) sites as candidate CES drivers. Additional 17 genes feature hypermutable missense mutations at individual positions, suggesting CES acting through gain-of-function (GoF). Among candidates are 5 of 13 known CES drivers, 11 cancer drivers, and 16 members of major signaling pathways; notably, 12 genes show CES evidence in direct sperm sequencing. CES increases the average mutation rate ~16-fold for LoF genes in both control trios and sperm and ~500-fold for pooled GoF sites in sperm. Positive selection in the male germline elevates the prevalence of genetic disorders and increases polymorphism levels, masking the effect of negative selection in human populations. Despite the excess of mutations in disease cohorts for 15 LoF CES driver candidates, only 5 show clear evidence of disease causality, suggesting that CES may lead to false-positive disease associations","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

However, it remains largely unclear how plants regulate their resistance to restrict bacterial infection in response to humidity. Here, we demonstrate that abscisic acid (ABA)-catabolizing ABA 8'-hydroxylase, encoded by CYP707A3 , plays a critical role in this resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Elevated humidity induces CYP707A3 expression, which is essential for reducing ABA levels and promoting stomatal opening, thereby limiting bacterial water-soaking and infection following leaf invasion. High humidity also increases cytosolic Ca2+ levels via the Ca2+ channels CNGC2 and CNGC4, with partial involvement from CNGC9, activating the calmodulin-binding transcription activator CAMTA3 to drive CYP707A3 induction. However, Pst DC3000 counteracts this defense response using type III secretion effectors, particularly AvrPtoB, facilitating water-soaking. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the competition between plants and bacteria for leaf water under elevated humidity.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Furthermore, it has not been established whether mitochondria in germ plasm possess unique characteristics essential for their function. In this study, we demonstrate that mitochondria are indispensable for PGCs development in non-teleost fishes and that their role is not dependent on their origin from germ plasm. Using sturgeon embryos, we showed that UV radiation applied to the vegetal pole effectively eliminates germ plasm, including mitochondria, and prevents PGCs formation. Remarkably, we restored germ plasm function and PGCs development by injecting mitochondria derived from donor eggs, even when these mitochondria were not originally part of the germ plasm. Transplanted mitochondria were successfully identified in larval PGCs using a fluorescent PKH26 tracer, and in interspecies transplantation experiments, their presence was confirmed using species-specific mtDNA and mtRNA primers in larvae and individual PGCs. Our findings reveal that mitochondria are critical but not germ plasm-specific determinants of PGCs formation. This study provides novel insights into the developmental pathways of germ cells and establishes a previously unrecognized flexibility in mitochondrial functionality within the germline. These findings also offer a potential method for conserving matrilineal genetics in critically endangered species like sturgeons, while simultaneously opening new avenues for studying germlines with high interspecies mitochondrial heteroplasmy and contributing to broader evolutionary and conservation biology.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Recent work has implicated three brain areas in posterior cerebral cortex - the place memory areas (PMAs) that are anterior to the three visual scene perception areas (SPAs) - in this function. However, PMAs' relationship to the broader cortical hierarchy remains unclear due to limited group-level characterization. Here, we examined the PMA and SPA locations across three fMRI datasets (44 participants, 29 female). SPAs were identified using a standard visual localizer where participants viewed scenes versus faces. PMAs were identified by contrasting activity when participants recalled personally familiar places versus familiar faces (Datasets 1-2) or places versus multiple categories (familiar faces, bodies, and objects, and famous faces; Dataset 3). Across datasets, the PMAs were located anterior to the SPAs on the ventral and lateral cortical surfaces. The anterior displacement between PMAs and SPAs was highly reproducible. Compared to public atlases, the PMAs fell at the boundary between externally-oriented networks (dorsal attention) and internally-oriented networks (default mode). Additionally, while SPAs overlapped with retinotopic maps, the PMAs were consistently located anterior to mapped visual cortex. These results establish the anatomical position of the PMAs at inflection points along the cortical hierarchy between unimodal sensory and transmodal, apical regions, which informs broader theories of how the brain integrates perception and memory for scenes. We have released probabilistic parcels of these regions to facilitate future research into their roles in spatial cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies from immunised cattle, primarily because of their ability to produce antibodies with ultra-long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) domains. Such antibodies have been shown to have potent and cross-reactive neutralisation phenotypes in other virus infections. Following extended immunisation with different forms of spike protein and using single B-cell sorting and phage display techniques, we isolated 33 mAbs, including 10 with ultra-long CDRH3s (>50 amino acids). Of these, mAbs P7 and 99 exhibited remarkable neutralisation breadth and potency. Notably, mAb P7, which possessed an ultra-long CDRH3, neutralised all tested variants, including SARS-CoV-1, with IC50 values ranging from 0.01 ug/mL to 1.06 ug/mL. This antibody was also cross-reactive against a panel of RBDs from diverse sarbecovirus species. Structural studies revealed that mAb 99 targets a region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Although the structure of the P7 Fab-RBD complex was not resolvable, data suggest P7 induces trimer dissociation by binding to an occluded RBD epitope, likely mediated by the extended CDRH3 structure. Syrian hamster challenge experiments, using several VOCs, showed that mAbs P7 and 99 significantly reduced lung viral load. These findings highlight the potential of bovine-derived, especially those possessing ultra-long CDRH3s, as effective therapeutics against current and future sarbecovirus threats.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) has inherently low catalytic efficiency, making it a key target for photosynthesis and crop improvement. However, introducing mutations to the chloroplast-encoded Rubisco large subunit (rbcL), which contains the enzymes catalytic sites, is technically challenging. In this study, we successfully generated a range of chloroplast-genome-edited Arabidopsis thaliana plants targeting rbcL by a targeted base editor, ptpTALECD. The M309I and D397N substitutions in rbcL resulted in an increased Rubisco catalytic rate (kcat) without any reductions of Rubisco content, thereby enhancing photosynthetic rates and plant growth under both current atmospheric CO2 concentrations (i.e., 381 mol mol-1) and projected future concentrations (i.e., 549 mol mol-1). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis showed that the M309I and D397N substitutions, although located far from the catalytic site, induce structural alterations in the catalytic (60s) loops. Our findings highlight the potential of Rubisco engineering to improve plant photosynthesis and growth, and underscore the unique opportunities that chloroplast genome editing offers for enhancing photosynthesis and crop productivity and reducing atmospheric CO2 levels in a non-GMO context.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

While mu opioid receptors are central to the analgesic effects of opioid drugs, the endogenous opioid neurocircuitry underlying pain and placebo analgesia remains poorly understood. The ventrolateral column of the posterior periaqueductal gray is a critical hub for nociception and endogenous analgesia mediated by opioid signaling. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the cell-type identities, the sub-second neural dynamics involved in pain modulation, the role of endogenous peptide neuromodulators, and the contextual factors influencing these processes. Using spatial mapping with single-nuclei RNA sequencing of pain-active neurons projecting to distinct long-range brain targets, alongside cell type-specific and activity-dependent genetic tools for in vivo optical recordings and modulation of neural activity and opioid peptide release, we identified a functional dichotomy in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Neurons expressing mu opioid receptors encode active nociceptive states, whereas enkephalin-releasing neurons drive pain relief during recovery from injury, in response to learned fear predictions, and during placebo analgesia. Finally, by leveraging the functional effects of placebo analgesia, we used direct optogenetic activation of vlPAG enkephalin neurons to drive opioid peptide release, resulting in a robust reduction in pain. These findings show that diverse need states converge on a shared midbrain circuit that releases endogenous opioids with high spatiotemporal precision to suppress nociceptive activity and promote analgesia.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

However, their development remains a considerable challenge. Here, we introduce a therapeutic ""living glue"" for the automatic detection and on-demand treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This living glue employs a genetically engineered, non-pathogenic Escherichia coli with a highly sensitive blood-inducible gene circuit to monitor gastrointestinal bleeding, a key indicator of severe IBD. Upon detection, the bacteria respond by producing potent adhesive and therapeutic proteins at bleeding sites, enabling robust attachment to inflamed tissues and sustained treatment. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model, a single rectal administration of the living glue markedly improved weight recovery, reversed colonic shortening, and reduced intestinal bleeding. Additionally, the living glue decreased intestinal inflammation, promoted mucosal repair, and restored gut barrier integrity, demonstrating comprehensive therapeutic effects in alleviating IBD symptoms.

How LE8 can foster healthy brain aging and interact with genetic risk factors to render the aging brain less vulnerable to dementia is not well understood.

ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of LE8 on the white matter brain aging and the moderating effects of the APOE4 allele.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cross-sectional study uses genetic, imaging, and other health-related data collected in the UK Biobank cohort. Participants included non-pregnant whites with LE8 variables, diffusion tensor imaging data, and genetic data on APOE4 available, and excluded the extreme white matter hyperintensities. The baseline assessment was performed from 2006 to 2010. The diffusion tensor imaging data were collected since 2014.

ExposuresLE8 variables, encompassing diet, physical activity, smoking, sleep, body mass index, lipids, hemoglobin, and blood pressure.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe white matter brain age was predicted from regional fractional anisotropy measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging data using the random forest regression method. The outcome white matter brain age gap was calculated by subtracting individuals chronological age from their predicted brain age.

ResultsThe analysis included 9,430 women and 9,387 men (mean age 55.45 [SD: 7.46] years). Higher LE8 scores were associated with lower white matter brain age gap, indicating delayed brain aging. The findings are consistent for each of the individual LE8 variables. The effect was stronger among non-APOE4 carriers (124 days younger per 10-point increase, 95% CI, 102 to 146 days; P<0.001) than APOE4 carriers (84 days younger per 10-point increase, 95% CI, 47 to 120 days; P<0.001). Notably, early middle-aged women with APOE4 showed significant interactions between LE8 scores and brain aging (P interaction = 0.048), not observed in men.

Conclusions and RelevanceAdherence to LE8 is associated with delayed brain aging, moderated by genetic factors such as APOE4. These findings highlight the potential of behavioral and lifestyle interventions in reducing dementia risk, emphasizing tailored prevention plans for those with different genetic predispositions to dementia and sex.","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

However, few biocontainment strategies can support the longer-term microbial survival that may be desired in a target environment without repeated human intervention. Here, we introduce the concept of an orthogonal obligate commensalism for the autonomous creation of environments that are permissive for survival of a biocontained microbe. We engineer one microbe to produce a non-standard amino acid (nsAA), and we engineer synthetic auxotrophy in a second microbe via reliance on this nsAA for growth. We show that this obligate commensalism is highly effective, with the survival of our commensal organism during co-culture dependent on the presence of our producer strain. We also show that this commensalism is orthogonal to a small microbial consortium isolated from maize roots, with survival of the synthetic auxotroph conditional upon the presence of the nsAA-producing strain in the consortium. Overall, our study demonstrates a transition from a chemical to a biological dependence for biocontained organisms that could lay the groundwork for biocontained synthetic ecologies.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

An open question is how experience interacts with innate constraints to enable functional specialization. We investigate this question by comparing vOTC function across sighted and congenitally blind adults. In sighted adults, a region in lateral vOTC called the fusiform face area (FFA) responds preferentially to faces, whereas distinct left-lateralized portions of vOTC respond to written language 1,2,5-12. In blind people, lateral vOTC responds to face touching, braille and speech, but their functional co-localization has not been tested 13-16. The same group of congenitally blind adults (n=20) touched faces and spatial layouts (Experiment 1) and performed a reading (braille) and spoken language task (Experiment 2). Sighted adults performed analogous tasks in the visual modality (n=28). Using within subject analyses, we replicate the separation of faces and written language in sighted adults: written language responses are found only in left vOTC and within that hemisphere they are separate from faces. By contrast, left and right vOTC responds to language in people born blind and in the left hemisphere face and language responses overlap. These findings suggest that visual experience contributes to segregating responses to face and language in vOTC. Co-localization of face and language responses suggests an innate predisposition for communication-relevant processing in lateral vOTC.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736287684369

Modification of pre-existing ligands with fragments that can alter the protein surface can lead to the creation of novel compounds ( targeted glues) able to induce neo-interactions between the target and an E3 ligase, resulting in targeted protein degradation. By screening a library of potential BRD9 targeted glue compounds, we have discovered a potent and selective, reversibly covalent BRD9 degrader, AMPTX-1. Co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that cell treatment with AMPTX-1 induces selective recruitment of BRD9 to the E3 ligase DCAF16. Degradation is dependent on the engagement of the surface Cys58 of DCAF16 and formation of a covalent adduct to DCAF16 is facilitated by the ternary complex formation with BRD9. BRD9 degradation is achieved in vivo after oral dosing, demonstrating that covalent recruitment of DCAF16 is a viable strategy for targeted protein degradation and can be achieved with drug-like, orally bioavailable compounds with promising in vivo activity.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369

Using population genetics, kinship analyses and the study of networks of identity-by-descent haplotype segment sharing, we elucidate the social and genetic dynamics of these communities between 4800-3900 cal BCE. Despite changes in settlement patterns, burial practices, and material culture, we document a high degree of genetic continuity. While one set of individuals we analyzed from a large community cemetery was genetically diverse, another site was more homogenous and closed, with numerous consanguineous relationships and evidence of patrilineality and patrilocality. These results document radically different kinship systems in contemporaneous ECA communities using similar material culture and living only about 100 km apart.","NA","biorxiv",1736287684369
