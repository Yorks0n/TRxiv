However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

Two-part population-based surveys, which test the infection status and also assess symptoms, have been used to estimate{psi} . Here, we identified a widely prevalent confounding effect that compromises these estimates and devised a formalism to adjust for it. The symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not all specific to SARS-CoV-2. They can be triggered by a host of other conditions, such as influenza virus infection. By not accounting for the source of the symptoms, the surveys may misclassify individuals experiencing symptoms from other conditions as symptomatic for SARS-CoV-2, thus underestimating{psi} . We developed a rigorous formalism to adjust for this confounding effect and derived a facile formula for the adjusted prevalence,{psi} adj. We applied it to data from 50 published serosurveys, conducted on the general populations from 28 nations.

The frequency and pace of these major genome structural changes are unknown, and it remains unclear whether or how they impact long-term genome evolution. Here, we compare whole chromosomal sequences of 3,631 genomes from 2,291 species spanning all major animal clades and show that animal karyotypes evolve primarily via karyotype contraction, associated with increased rates of chromosomal fusion-with-mixing and dispersion that largely obey chromosomal algebra1, or karyotype expansion, which breaks up ancestral linkage groups and forms new chromosomal elements via non-algebraic changes. We show that chromosomal changes can be associated with major extinction events. Using a multi-scale encoding of pan-animal genome homology and a manifold representation of genomic changes, we find that genome evolution is not only driven by changes at the chromosomal level, but that subchromosomal mixing and irreversibility define clade-specific evolution. Using this  evolutionary genome topology approach, we calculate extrema of irreversible genomic configurations and identify species that occupy intermediate manifold positions, providing evidence for distinct macro-evolutionary trajectories. We propose that investigation of mixed state accumulation around important gene loci (such as Hox) will be crucial in capturing and further study of clade-specific regulatory innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1726438134846

The unique insights from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge evolutionary distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly-acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability or homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between genes in marine annelids (including Hox), they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements gave rise to new genetic elements that may have facilitated the adaptation to freshwater and terrestrial environments in clitellates. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping through genome-wide chromosome scrambling in clitellates consistent with the punctuated equilibrium model, which sharply contrasts with the highly conserved chromosomal architecture observed in most animal taxa. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of this animal lineage resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large evolutionary distances.","NA","biorxiv",1726438134846

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

As the foundation for lifelong mental health is established during childhood and adolescence, early prevention and treatment of mental health problems, such as through psychotherapy, are crucial. In Germany, current outpatient psychotherapeutic care capacities appear inadequate, while systematic evaluations of the care situation are lacking. This study investigates the state of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany and evaluates various methodological approaches for its assessment. We conducted a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Publications from January 2018 to December 2023 were sourced from PubPsych, PubMed, APA PsycInfo, Google Scholar, and ProQuest. Included studies reported quantitative primary data on the mental health of community samples of children and adolescents in Germany or their outpatient psychotherapeutic care. We included 41 publications comprising epidemiological studies, administrative data, and psychotherapist and patient reports. A lack of systematic and standardized research approaches resulted in significant variance in data. Nonetheless, qualitative analysis revealed that approximately one four children and adolescents in Germany is affected by mental health problems, while one in six to seven children and adolescents requires psychotherapeutic treatment. Yet, only up to one in fifty receives guideline-based psychotherapy. Most requests for initial psychotherapeutic consultations are unmet, with waiting times for guideline-based psychotherapy exceeding six months for at least half of the patients. Overall, our findings suggest that outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany is still insufficient. They advocate for a systematic, multimodal, and longitudinal assessment of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care, along with an expansion of treatment capacities to enhance access for children and adolescents in Germany.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

We address this central issue by investigating the RNA binding activity of the Drosophila Hox TF Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in alternative splicing and morphogenesis. Relying on molecular and genetic interactions, we uncover a homodimerization-dependent mechanism by which Ubx regulates splicing. Notably, this mechanism enables the decoupling of Ubx-DNA and -RNA binding activity in splicing. We identify a critical residue for Ubx-RNA binding and demonstrate the essential role of Ubx-RNA binding ability for its homeotic functions. Overall, we uncover a unique mechanism for Ubx-mediated splicing and underscore the critical contribution of synergistic DNA/RNA binding for its morphogenetic functions. These findings advance our understanding of co-transcriptional regulation and highlight the significance of TF-DNA/RNA synergistic function in shaping gene regulatory networks in living organisms.

Our physical RC system, using an Escherichia coli strain, demonstrates superior performance compared to multi-linear regression or support-vector machine and comparable performance to multi-layer perceptron in various regression and classification tasks. Additionally, the performances of RC based on genome-scale metabolic models for several bacterial species correlate with the diversity and complexity of phenotypes they produce. These findings highlight the potential of bacterial RC systems for complex computational tasks typically reserved for digital systems and suggest future research directions, including optimizing feature-to-nutrient mappings and integrating with emerging technologies for enhanced computing capabilities.","NA","biorxiv",1726438134846

Here, we define the INV proteome and find that it is molecularly heterogeneous, and enriched for transmembrane cargo molecules including integrins, transporters, and ATG9A, a lipid scramblase associated with autophagy. ATG9A is known to reside in  ATG9 vesicles: small vesicles that contribute to autophagosome formation.

Even when effective vaccines became available, many communities remained at high risk of surges in COVID-19-related hospitalizations due to waning immunity, low uptake of booster vaccinations, and the continual emergence of new variations of SARS-CoV-2. Some risk metrics, such as the CDC's Community Levels, were developed to predict the impact of COVID-19 on the community-level healthcare system based on routine surveillance data. However, they had limited utility as they were not routinely updated based on accumulating data and were not directly linked to specific outcomes, such as surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations beyond local capacities. Regression models could resolve these limitations, but they have limited interpretability and do not convey the reasoning behind their predictions. In this paper, we evaluated decision tree classifiers that were developed in ""real-time"" to predict surges in local hospitalizations due to COVID-19 between July 2020 and November 2022. These classifiers would have provided visually intuitive and interpretable decision rules for local decision-makers to understand and act upon, and by being updated weekly, would have responded to changes in the epidemic. We showed that these classifiers exhibit reasonable predictive ability with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) >80%. These classifiers maintained their performance temporally (i.e, over the duration of the pandemic) and spatially (i.e., across US counties). We also showed that these classifiers outperformed the CDC's Community Levels for predicting high hospital occupancy.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

Improved understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases is required to develop novel biomarkers and targeted treatments. Moreover, it is unclear whether shared or distinct pathogenic processes underpin the LVV spectrum. To address this, we performed plasma proteomic profiling, quantifying 184 plasma proteins using Olink immunoassays in two independent cohorts totalling 405 individuals. In Cohort 1, comparison of patients with TAK (N=96) and large vessel-GCA (LV-GCA) (N=35) versus healthy controls (HCs) (N=35) revealed 52 and 72 significant differentially abundant proteins, respectively. Correlation with disease activity status identified novel TAK and LV-GCA disease activity markers. Cohort 2 consisted of patients presenting acutely with possible cranial GCA (C-GCA); C-GCA was subsequently confirmed (n=150) or excluded (n=89). 31 proteins were associated with C-GCA. Analyses stratified by temporal artery biopsy results revealed enrichment of the proteomic signal in biopsy-proven GCA, suggesting the presence of distinct endotypes within C-GCA. Cross-disease comparison revealed that active TAK, LV-GCA and biopsy-proven C-GCA had highly similar plasma proteomic profiles. Twenty-six proteomic associations were shared across all three groups including IL6, monocyte/macrophage related proteins (CCL5, CCL7, CSF1), tissue remodelling proteins (VEGFA, TIMP1, TNC) and proteins not previously linked to LVV (TNFSF14, IL7R). We also observed disease-specific associations including increased CXCL9 in LV-GCA and C-GCA but not in TAK and decreases in the extracellular matrix protein COMP in TAK but not in LV-GCA or C-GCA. Evaluation of publicly available transcriptomic data from LV-GCA aortic tissue revealed that 47 of the 112 proteins significantly altered in [&ge;]1 LVV type had significantly altered mRNA expression in LVV aortic tissue. Similarities in LVV proteomic profiles suggest shared pathobiology involving innate immunity, particularly monocyte/macrophages, lymphocyte homeostasis and tissue remodelling processes. Our results highlight a signature of immune-stromal cross talk in LVV and identify potential novel therapeutic targets in this axis (e.g. TNFSF14). The correspondence of plasma signatures to tissue phenotype highlights the potential for non-invasive monitoring of arterial inflammation and injury.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

MR relies on a set of assumptions to obtain unbiased effect estimates, one of these assumptions is that there is no pathway from the genetic variants to the outcome that does not act through the exposure. Increasing genome-wide association study (GWAS) sample sizes for the exposure enables discovery of instrumental variables with smaller effect sizes. We illustrate through simulations how smaller effect sizes could arise from genetic variants that act through traits that have greater liability to confound an exposure-outcome relationship. When such genetic variants are selected as instruments this can bias the MR effect estimate obtained from that instrument in the same direction as the confounded observational association but with larger magnitude. Through simulation we illustrate how the total bias of the MR estimates increases across a range of standard MR estimation methods increases as the proportion of the genetic instruments that are associated with the confounder increases. However, if such heritable confounders are known and can be instrumented, the confounder free effect estimate can be obtained through applying a pre-estimation filtering to standard MR methods, removing instruments that explain more variation in that confounder than the exposure, or by estimating effects through multivariable MR. We highlight the potential for SNPs identified in GWAS to be associated with potential confounders through examination of a recent GWAS of C-Reactive Protein. Finally, we illustrate our approach through estimation of the causal effect of age at menarche on type 2 diabetes, hypothesising that the MR effect estimate may be biased by confounding due to the inclusion of genetic variants associated with early life adiposity as instruments.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

Lacking recent comprehensive reviews, the field of Hill-type modelling is however dense and hard-to-explore, with detrimental consequences on innovation. Here we present the first systematic review of Hill-type muscle modelling. It aims to clarify the literature by detailing its contents and critically discussing the state-of-the-art by identifying the latest advances, current gaps, and potential future directions in Hill-type modelling. For this purpose, fifty-seven criteria-abiding Hill-type models were assessed according to a completeness evaluation, which identified the modelled muscle properties, and a modelling evaluation, which considered the level of validation and reusability of the models, as well as their modelling strategy and calibration. It is concluded that most models (1) do not significantly advance beyond historical gold standards, (2) neglect the importance of parameter identification, (3) lack robust validation, and (4) are not reusable in other studies. Besides providing a convenient tool supported by extensive supplementary material for navigating the literature, the results of this review highlight the need for global recommendations in Hill-type modelling to optimize inter-study consistency, knowledge transfer and model reusability.","NA","biorxiv",1726438134846

Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles from January 1, 2019 to February 9, 2024. Studies reporting effectiveness data from at least two doses of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccination in adults with medical conditions at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were included. Outcomes of interest were SARS-CoV-2 infection (overall, symptomatic, and severe), hospitalization due to COVID-19, and death due to COVID-19. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated with random effects models. Subgroup analyses by specific medical conditions, number of vaccinations, age, and SARS-CoV-2 variant were conducted. Heterogeneity between studies was estimated with chi-square testing. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluations framework. Results: Sixty-five observational studies capturing the original/ancestral-containing primary series to Omicron-containing bivalent original-BA4-5 vaccinations were included in the meta-analysis. mRNA-1273 was associated with significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.79-0.92]; I2=92.5%), symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.65-0.86]; I2=62.3%), severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.78-0.89]; I2=38.0%), hospitalization due to COVID-19 (RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.82-0.94]; I2=38.7%), and death due to COVID-19 (RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76-0.93]; I2=1.3%) than BNT162b2. Findings were generally consistent across subgroups. Evidence certainty was low or very low because sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials are impractical in this heterogeneous population. Conclusion: Meta-analysis of 65 observational studies showed that vaccination with mRNA-1273 was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and death than BNT162b2 in patients with medical conditions at high risk of severe COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

Methods: We conducted a 50-state non-probability internet survey conducted in 6 waves between October 6, 2022 and January 29, 2024, with respondents age 18 and older. Respondents completed the American Conspiratorial Thinking Scale (ACTS) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Survey-weighted regression models were used to examine sociodemographic and clinical associations with ACTS score, and associations with vaccination status. Results: Across the 6 survey waves, there were 123,781 unique individuals. After reweighting, a total of 78.6% of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed with at least one conspiratorial idea; 19.0% agreed with all four of them. More conspiratorial thoughts were reported among those age 25 - 54, males, individuals who finished high school but did not start or complete college, those with household income between $25,000 and $50,000 per year, and those who reside in rural areas, as well as those with greater levels of depressive symptoms. Endorsing more conspiratorial thoughts was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of being vaccinated against COVID-19. Discussion: A substantial proportion of US adults endorsed at least some conspiratorial thinking, which varied widely across population subgroups. The extent of correlation with non-vaccination suggests the importance of considering such thinking in designing public health strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and inflammatory proteins may contribute to the development of FM. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins (cytokines/chemokines), and FM using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and meta-analysis approaches. Methods: MR analyses were conducted using genetic data from European populations, employing methods such as MR-IVW, MR-Egger, and MR-weighted median. Reverse MR was also performed, with FM treated as the exposure. A meta-analysis was conducted to consolidate the findings. Results: Ruminococcus gauvreauii was identified as a risk factor for FM, while Enterorhabdus, Parabacteroides, Butyricicoccus, and Prevotella 9 were found to be protective. Five inflammatory proteins C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), S100-A12, Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), Monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2/CCL8), and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) exhibited protective associations, while Natural killer cell receptor 2B4 (NKCR-2B4/CD244) and Interleukin-12 subunit beta (IL-12{beta}) were associated with an increased risk of FM. Conclusion: This study highlights the role of gut microbiota and inflammatory proteins (cytokines/chemokines) in the pathogenesis of FM. Through Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, the findings suggest their involvement in immune regulation, inflammatory responses, and viral pathways. These findings provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets for modulating gut health and immune responses, opening new avenues for future research and clinical interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

The primary aim of our study is to elucidate the complex network of interactions between SARS-CoV-2, tuberculosis, and lung cancer employing a bioinformatics and network biology approach. Lung cancer is the leading cause of significant illness and death connected to cancer worldwide. Tuberculosis (TB) is a prevalent medical condition induced by the Mycobacterium bacteria. It mostly affects the lungs but may also have an influence on other areas of the body. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes a risk of respiratory complications between lung cancer and tuberculosis. SARS-CoV-2 impacts the lower respiratory system and causes severe pneumonia, which can significantly increase the mortality risk in individuals with lung cancer. We conducted transcriptome analysis to determine molecular biomarkers and common pathways in lung cancer, TB, and COVID-19, which provide understanding into the association of SARS-CoV-2 to lung cancer and tuberculosis. Based on the compatible RNA-seq data, our research employed GREIN and NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to perform differential gene expression analysis. Our study exploited three RNA-seq datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)--GSE171110, GSE89403, and GSE81089--to identify distinct relationships between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SARS-CoV-2, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. We identified 30 common genes among SARS-CoV-2, tuberculosis, and lung cancer (25 upregulated genes and 5 downregulated genes). We analyzed the following five databases: WikiPathway, KEGG, Bio Carta, Elsevier Pathway and Reactome. Using Cytohubbas MCC and Degree methods, We determined the top 15 hub genes resulting from the PPI interaction. These hub genes can serve as potential biomarkers, leading to novel treatment strategies for disorders under investigation. Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified as the molecules that control the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of interest, either during transcription or after transcription. We identified 35 prospective therapeutic compounds that form significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SARS-CoV-2, lung cancer, and tuberculosis, which could potentially serve as medications. We hypothesized that the potential medications that emerged from this investigation may have therapeutic benefits.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

We have previously reported that higher dose corticosteroids cause harm in patients with hypoxia but not receiving ventilatory support (non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation), but the balance of efficacy and safety in patients receiving ventilatory support is uncertain.

MethodsThis randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) assessed multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adult patients receiving ventilatory support were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual care with higher dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 10 mg once daily for 5 days or until discharge if sooner) or usual standard of care alone (which includes dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for 10 days or until discharge if sooner). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalisation and (among participants not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline) the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Recruitment closed on 31 March 2024 when funding for the trial ended. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsBetween 25 May 2021 and 9 January 2024, 477 COVID-19 patients receiving ventilatory support were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus higher dose corticosteroids versus usual care alone (of whom 99% received corticosteroids during the follow-up period). Of those randomised, 221 (46%) were in Asia, 245 (51%) in the UK and 11 (2%) in Africa. 143 (30%) had diabetes mellitus. Overall, 86 (35%) of 246 patients allocated to higher dose corticosteroids versus 86 (37%) of 231 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0.87; 95% CI 0.64-1.18; p=0.37). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (128 [52%] in the higher dose corticosteroids group vs 120 [52%] in the usual care group; RR 1.04, 0.81-1.33]; p=0.78). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (76 [37%] of 206 vs 93 [45%] of 205; RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63-1.00]; p=0.05).

InterpretationIn patients hospitalised for COVID-19 receiving ventilatory support, we found no evidence that higher dose corticosteroids reduced the risk of death compared to usual care, which included low dose corticosteroids.

Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) has been demonstrated as an effective intervention to mitigate these risks. However, challenges to health care implementation in the custodial sector result in suboptimal and variable access to OAT in prisons nationally.

Main recommendationsAmong a national multi-disciplinary expert panel, we conducted a modified Delphi study which yielded 19 recommendations to government, relevant health authorities and custodial health services. These recommendations cover five core domains: induction or continuation of OAT, OAT options and administration, transition of care to the community, special populations, organisational support. Key recommendations include prompt recognition and treatment of opioid withdrawal, active linkage to community-based OAT providers upon release, and ensuring appropriate organisational support through local protocols, adequate funding, and monitoring of key program indicators.

Changes in management as a result of this statementThis consensus statement addresses a significant gap in national policy on OAT in Australian prisons. The recommendations set forth best practice standards grounded in evidence and expert consensus. We expect that implementing these recommendations will enhance the quality, consistency, and continuity of OAT both within prison and upon release. Optimizing OAT provision is crucial for improving health outcomes and addressing overdose, which is the leading cause of death among people released from prison.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1726438134846

In particular, clustering remains one of the most common tools to dissect the chemical space. Unfortunately, most current approaches present unfavorable time and memory scaling, which makes them unsuitable to handle million- and billion-sized sets. Here, we propose to bypass these problems with a time- and memory-efficient clustering algorithm, BitBIRCH. This method uses a tree structure similar to the one found in the Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH) algorithm to ensure O(N) time scaling. BitBIRCH leverages the instant similarity (iSIM) formalism to process binary fingerprints, allowing the use of Tanimoto similarity, and reducing memory requirements. Our tests show that BitBIRCH is already > 1,000 times faster than standard implementations of the Taylor-Butina clustering for libraries with 1,500,000 molecules. BitBIRCH increases efficiency without compromising the quality of the resulting clusters. We explore strategies to handle large sets, which we applied in the clustering of one billion molecules under 5 hours using a parallel/iterative BitBIRCH approximation.","NA","biorxiv",1726438134846

MethodsWe utilised age-structured population and mortality data for all UK countries from 2005 to 2023. Mortality rates were calculated for each age group, and excess mortality was estimated using the Office for National Statistics (ONS) method.

ResultsOur most concerning finding is an increase in all-cause mortality rates for middle-aged adults (30-54 years) starting around 2012. The COVID-19 pandemic may have further impacted these rates, but the pre-existing upward trend suggests that current elevated mortality rates might have been reached regardless of the pandemic. This finding is more alarming than the slowdown in the decline of cardiovascular disease death rates for individuals under 75 noted by the British Heart Foundation.

ConclusionOur results highlight the importance of considering both immediate pandemic impacts and long-term mortality trends in public health strategies. This underscores the need for targeted interventions and improved healthcare planning to address both ongoing and future challenges.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

DesignRetrospective cross-sectional study.

Participants5,351 patients (9,564 eyes) who underwent macular OCT imaging and Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) tests (24-2 or 10-2 test patterns) at a university hospital from 2006 to 2023. The dataset included 47,653 paired OCT-VF data points, including various ocular conditions.

MethodsWe trained a segmentation-free 3DCNN model based on the EfficientNet3D-b0 architecture on a comprehensive OCT dataset to estimate VF. We evaluated the models performance using Pearsons correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. We assessed residual variability using a jackknife resampling approach and compared OCT-VF and HFA datasets using generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusting the number of VF tests, follow-up duration, age, and clustering by eye and patient.

Main Outcome MeasuresCorrelations between estimated and measured VF thresholds and mean deviations (MDs), and residual variability of OCT-VF and HFA.

ResultsWe observed strong correlations between the estimated and measured VF parameters (Pearsons r: 24-2 thresholds 0.893, MD 0.932; 10-2 thresholds 0.902, MD 0.945; all p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the estimated and measured MD, with a slight proportional bias. GEE analysis demonstrated significantly lower residual variability for OCT-VF than for HFA (24-2 thresholds: 1.10 vs. 2.48 dB; 10-2 thresholds: 1.20 vs. 2.48 dB; all p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected), with lower variability across all test points, severities, and ages, thus highlighting the robustness of the segmentation-free 3DCNN approach in a heterogeneous clinical sample.

ConclusionsA segmentation-free 3DCNN model objectively estimated VF from OCT images with high accuracy and significantly lower residual variability than subjective HFA measurements in a heterogeneous clinical sample, including patients with glaucoma and individuals with other ocular diseases. The improved reliability, lower variability, and objective nature of OCT-VF highlight its value for enhancing VF assessment and monitoring of various ocular conditions, potentially facilitating earlier detection of progression and more efficient disease management.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

ResultsThere were 576 total corrections for the included 486 articles. Forty-three percent (n=245) corrections specifically pertained to COVID-19. Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to be about spelling (0% vs 23.6%), locations (1.2% vs 16.3%), or title/degree (0% vs 10.6%), and more likely to be about a vaccine/vaccination (21.2% vs 0.3%), incidence/cases of conditions (12.2% vs 0.3%), or disease testing (7.8% vs 0.3%; p<0.001).

Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to result in an equivocal tone (16.7% vs 88.8%), but they were more likely to both overstate (54.7% vs 8.5%) and understate (23.7% vs 2.4%) the situation in the original text (p<0.001). Ten reporters (of 346) accounted for 24% of the corrections. The reporter with the single most corrections accounted for 7% of the corrections.

ConclusionsDifferential tone of the corrections suggests bias in the reporting of COVID-19 topics in a top news outlet. The reporting of unbiased information is a first step in addressing issues of misinformation in public health messaging.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

To date, the cnidarian Turritopsis dohrnii is the only known species capable of undergoing reverse development after the onset of sexual reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1726438134846

Traditional dynamic disease modeling is an essential tool for characterization and prediction, but often requires extensive expertise and specialized software, which may not be readily available in low-resource environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an AI-powered modeling assistant that utilizes advanced capabilities from OpenAIs latest models and functionality. This tool enhances the accessibility and usability of infectious disease models and simulation frameworks by allowing users to generate or modify model configurations through intuitive natural language inputs or by importing explicit model descriptions. Our prototype integrates with an established open-source disease simulation framework called the Compartmental Modeling Software (CMS) to provide a seamless modeling experience from setup to analysis. The AI assistant efficiently interprets disease model parameters, constructs accurate model files, executes simulations in a controlled environment, and assists in result interpretation using advanced analytics tools. It encapsulates expert knowledge and adheres to best practices to support users ranging from novices to expert modelers. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of this AI assistant, particularly its performance in complex scenarios where it might generate inaccurate specifications. By enhancing the ease of disease modeling and supporting ongoing capacity-building initiatives, we believe that AI assistants like this one could significantly contribute to global health efforts by empowering researchers, especially in regions with limited resources, to develop and refine their disease models independently. This innovative approach has the potential to democratize disease modeling in global health, offering a scalable solution that adapts to diverse needs across a wide-range of geographies, languages, and populations.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1726438134846

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846

As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns.

Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.","NA","medrxiv",1726438134846
