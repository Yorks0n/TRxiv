Reconstruction of visual input from human fMRI data has garnered significant attention in recent years. Comparatively less focus has been directed towards vision reconstruction from single-cell recordings, despite its potential to provide a more direct measure of the information represented by the brain. Here, we achieve high-quality reconstructions of videos presented to mice, from the activity of neurons in their visual cortex. Using our method of video optimization via gradient descent through a state-of-the-art dynamic neural encoding model we reliably reconstruct 10-second movies at 30 Hz from two-photon calcium imaging data. We achieve a {approx} 2-fold increase in pixel-by-pixel correlation compared to previous reconstructions of static images from mouse V1, while also capturing temporal dynamics. We find that critical for high-quality reconstructions are the number of neurons in the dataset and the use of model ensembling.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

However, evidence for a dominant female role in these societies has been scarce. We studied social organisation, mobility patterns and gendered practices in Neolithic Southwest Asia using 131 paleogenomes from Catalhoyuk East Mound (7100-5950 BCE), a major settlement in Central Anatolia with an uninterrupted occupation and an apparent egalitarian structure. In contrast to widespread genetic evidence for patrilocality in Neolithic Europe, the Catalhoyuk individuals revealed no indication of patrilocal mobility. Analysing genetic kin ties among individuals buried in the same house (co-burials) across 35 Catalhoyuk buildings, we identified close ties concentrated within buildings and among neighbours in Catalhoyuk's Early period, akin to those in the preceding Pre-Pottery Neolithic in Southwest Asia. This pattern weakened over time: by the late 7th millennium BCE, subadults buried in the same building were rarely closely genetically related, despite sharing similar diets. Still, throughout the site's occupation, genetic connections within Catalhoyuk buildings were much more frequently connected via the maternal than the paternal line. We also identified differential funerary treatment of female subadults compared to those of males, with a higher frequency of grave goods associated with females. Our results reveal how kinship practices changed while key female roles persisted over one thousand years in a large Neolithic community in western Eurasia.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Sampling many trees and sequences under an evolutionary model, we train the network to learn a function that enables predicting the former from the latter. Under a commonly used model of protein sequence evolution and exploiting GPU acceleration, it outpaces fast distance methods while matching maximum likelihood accuracy on simulated and empirical data.

We examined the subcellular distribution of MICOS, a spatial and functional organizer of mitochondria, and discovered that it dynamically enriches at the tip of a minor population of mitochondria in the cell periphery that we term METEORs. METEORs have a unique composition; MICOS enrichment sites are depleted of mtDNA and matrix proteins and contain high levels of the Ca2+ uniporter MCU, suggesting a functional specialization. METEORs are also enriched for the myosin MYO19, which promotes their trafficking to a small subset of filopodia. We identify a positive correlation between the length of filopodia and the presence of METEORs and show that elimination of mitochondria from filopodia impairs cellular motility.

Here, we characterize EVs produced by the dominant human gut methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii, which, unlike most archaea, contains a peptidoglycan cell wall. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that M. smithii EVs are enriched in various proteins responsible for chromatin structure, including histones, and DNA repair. Consistently, the M. smithii EVs carry DNA, with fragments covering the entire cellular chromosome. Notably, the EVs are strongly enriched in extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) molecules which originate from excision of a 2.9-kb chromosomal fragment and a proviral genome. The eccDNA encodes two of the key methanogenesis enzymes and could boost their expression inside the cells through the gene dosage effect. Furthermore, four of the top ten most abundant EV proteins are implicated in methanogenesis. Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) suggests that EVs are formed by budding from the cell membrane and are trapped under the cell wall prior to liberation through local disruptions in the cell wall. Collectively, our results reveal parallels with EV biogenesis in bacteria and suggest that M. smithii EVs facilitate the export of both cellular and viral DNA as well as key metabolic proteins in the gut environment, with potential impact on methane production.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

This approach aims to perform simultaneous antibody sequencing and epitope mapping using a combination of single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bottom-up proteomics techniques based on mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We evaluate the performance of the deep-learning tool ModelAngelo in determining de novo antibody sequences directly from reconstructed 3D volumes of antibody-antigen complexes. We demonstrate that while map quality is a critical bottleneck, it is possible to sequence antibody variable domains from cryoEM reconstructions with accuracies of up to 80-90%. While the rate of errors exceeds the typical levels of somatic hypermutation, we show that the ModelAngelo-derived sequences can be used to assign the used V-genes. This provides a functional guide to assemble de novo peptides from LC-MS/MS data more accurately and improves the tolerance to a background of polyclonal antibody sequences. Following this proof-of-principle, we discuss the feasibility and future directions of this approach to characterize antigen-specific antibody repertoires.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

However, large size also poses biophysical challenges, especially regarding the transport of nutrients to all cells; these constraints are typically overcome through multicellular innovations (e.g., a circulatory system). Here we show that an emergent biophysical mechanism -- spontaneous fluid flows arising from metabolically-generated density gradients -- can alleviate constraints on nutrient transport, enabling exponential growth in nascent multicellular clusters of yeast lacking any multicellular adaptations for nutrient transport or fluid flow. Surprisingly, beyond a threshold size, the metabolic activity of experimentally-evolved snowflake yeast clusters drives large-scale fluid flows that transport nutrients throughout the cluster at speeds comparable to those generated by the cilia of extant multicellular organisms. These flows support exponential growth at macroscopic sizes that theory predicts should be diffusion limited. This work demonstrates how simple physical mechanisms can act as a  biophysical scaffold to support the evolution of multicellularity by opening up phenotypic possibilities prior to genetically-encoded innovations. More broadly, our findings highlight how cooption of conserved physical processes is a crucial but underappreciated facet of evolutionary innovation across scales.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Many proteins exert their functions through interactions with other proteins, and a significant challenge is designing these interactions effectively. While most efforts have focused on larger, more stable proteins, shorter peptides offer advantages such as lower manufacturing costs, reduced steric hindrance, and the ability to traverse cell membranes when cyclized. Here, we present an AI method to design novel linear and cyclic peptide binders of varying lengths based solely on a protein target sequence. Our approach does not specify a binding site or the length of the binder, making the procedure completely blind. We demonstrate that high-affinity binders can be selected directly from predicted confidence metrics, and adversarial designs can be avoided through orthogonal in silico evaluation, tripling the success rate. We selected a single designed linear sequence for lengths ranging from 8 to 20 residues and evaluated the affinity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Of the sequences tested, 6 out of 13 (46%) displayed affinity with dissociation constants (Kd) in the micromolar range; the strongest binder had a Kd of 19 nM, and the weakest had a Kd of 7.9 M. Our protocol, EvoBind2 (https://github.com/patrickbryant1/EvoBind), enables binder design based solely on a protein target sequence, suggesting the potential for a rapid increase in the number of proteins that can be targeted for various biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

The olfactory nerve is widely accepted as the neuroinvasive route by which the etiological agent SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain, but the trigeminal nerve is an often-overlooked additional route. Based on this consensus, we initially conducted a pilot experiment investigating the olfactory nerve route of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion via intranasal inoculation in AC70 human ACE2 transgenic mice. Notably, we found that the trigeminal ganglion is an early and highly efficient site of viral replication, which then rapidly spread widely throughout the brain where neurons were primarily targeted. Despite the extensive viral infection across the brain, obvious evidence of tissue pathology including inflammatory infiltration, glial activation, and apoptotic cell deaths were not consistently observed, albeit inflammatory cytokines were significantly induced. However, the expression levels of different genes related to neuronal function, including the neurotransmitter dopamine pathway as well as synaptic function, and markers of neuronal damage were altered as compared to mock-infected mice. Our findings suggest that the trigeminal nerve can be a neuroinvasive route complementary to the olfactory nerve and that the ensuing neuroinvasion presented a unique neuropathological profile. This study provides insights into potential neuropathogenic mechanisms utilized by coronaviruses.

IMPORTANCECOVID-19 presents with extrapulmonary signs and symptoms, the most notable of which involve the central nervous system, such as seizures and alterations in consciousness, and can eventually lead to death if severe enough. Some neurological signs and symptoms may continue to persist in some patients even after the resolution of active viral infection in the form of post-acute sequelae. Since the trigeminal nerve is a commonly under-studied route of entry into the brain in studies of coronaviruses and the neuropathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 are not entirely elucidated, there is a need to thoroughly investigate this route of neuroinvasion. The significance of our research is in providing insights into the possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion as well as the discovery of potential neuropathogenic mechanisms which may help guide the development of novel medical countermeasures.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Policymakers face the challenge of allocating finite resources for testing and surveillance across locations, with the goal of maximising the information obtained about the underlying trends in prevalence and incidence. We model this decision-making process as an iterative node classification problem on an undirected and unweighted graph, in which nodes represent locations and edges represent movement of infectious agents among them. To begin, a single node is randomly selected for testing and determined to be either infected or uninfected. Test feedback is then used to update estimates of the probability of unobserved nodes being infected and to inform the selection of nodes for testing at the next iterations, until a certain resource budget is exhausted. Using this framework we evaluate and compare the performance of previously developed Active Learning policies, including node-entropy and Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement. We explore the performance of these policies under different outbreak scenarios using simulated outbreaks on both synthetic and empirical networks. Further, we propose a novel policy that considers the distance-weighted average entropy of infection predictions among the neighbours of each candidate node. Our proposed policy outperforms existing ones in most outbreak scenarios, leading to a reduction in the number of tests required to achieve a certain predictive accuracy. Our findings could inform the design of cost-effective surveillance strategies for emerging and endemic pathogens, and reduce the uncertainties associated with early risk assessments in resource-constrained situations.","NA","medrxiv",1719266945338

This article presents an evidence-based model for the prediction of the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to the terrorist attack and the war.

Main bodyThe creation of the model consisted of several steps. Firstly, the Israeli population was divided into six groups based on the intensity, context, and type of traumatic exposure (direct exposure to terror, close proximity to terror, soldiers in combat and support units, intense exposure to rocket attacks, moderate exposure to rocket attacks, and indirectly affected communities), and the population size of each group was assessed using official national databases. Secondly, an estimation of the expected prevalence of PTSD in each of the exposure groups was based on a review of the relevant literature. A random-effects meta-analysis of the prevalence rates was conducted separately per each exposure group. Finally, the predicted number of PTSD causalities in the population was calculated by multiplying the group size and the PTSD prevalence estimation. Based on population size and estimated PTSD prevalence within each exposure category, the model predicts that approximately 5.3% (N=519,923) of the Israeli population (95% prediction interval, 160,346-879,502), may develop PTSD as a result of the terrorist attack and the war.

ConclusionsThe predicted number of individuals with PTSD following mass trauma is expected to be considerable. The presented model can assist policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in preparing and devising adequate interventions for the mental health needs of large populations. Moreover, this model can be applied in other instances of mass-trauma exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1719266945338

MrDAG combines three causal inference strategies in a unified manner. It uses genetic variation as instrumental variables to account for unmeasured confounders. It performs structure learning to detect and orientate the direction of the dependencies within exposures and outcomes. Finally, interventional calculus is employed to derive principled causal effect estimates. MrDAG was motivated to unravel how lifestyle and behavioural exposures impact mental health. It highlights education and smoking as key effective points of intervention given their downstream effects on mental health. These insights would have been difficult to delineate without modelling the causal paths between multiple exposures and outcomes at once.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

This was a proof of principle study to test the feasibility of the trial to optimise the design of an appropriately powered study.

DesignTwo-centre, double-blind, two-arm parallel, randomised placebo-controlled, dietary intervention feasibility trial. Patients with radiographic knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence score 2-3), with pain of at least 4 on a scale of 0-10 were recruited. The intervention was a high glucoraphanin broccoli, (source of SFN), or a matched placebo (no SFN) soup. Pain and measures of physical function were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks.

ResultsThe mean WOMAC pain score (scale 0 - 20) was decreased by 4.2 (95% CI: 1.03,7.38) following intervention, Similar patterns of improvement were observed for other pain and function outcome measures. Study data, sample collections and intervention adherence were 100% compliant except where COVID restrictions applied. Acceptability for randomisation was 100% and acceptability for the intervention was 92%. There were three related adverse events, two of which were expected.

ConclusionsHigh glucosinolate broccoli soup is a novel approach to managing OA that is widely accessible and can be used on a large scale. This study shows that it is an acceptable way of delivering dietary bioactives and has potential for therapeutic benefit. The primary outcome of pain improved in the intervention group compared to the placebo and the confidence interval encompassed the minimal clinically important difference. The data provide justification for proceeding to a large scale, appropriately powered intervention trial.","NA","medrxiv",1719266945338

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface and to a new and highly relevant livestock species, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded.

Despite the fundamental importance of BLTPs for cellular function, the architecture, composition, and lipid transfer mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here, we present the subunit composition and the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic C. elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel whose interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously uncharacterized proteins, here named ""Intake"" and ""Spigot"", both of which interact with the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids enter the tunnel. Intake has three transmembrane helices, one of which borders the entrance to the tunnel; Spigot has one transmembrane helix and extends 80 [A] along the cytosolic surface of LPD-3. Experiments in multiple model systems indicate that Spigot plays a conserved role in ER-PM contact site formation. Our LPD-3 complex structural data, together with molecular dynamics simulations of the transmembrane region in a lipid bilayer, reveal protein-lipid interactions that suggest a model for how the native LPD-3-complex mediates bulk lipid transport and provide a foundation for mechanistic studies of BLTPs.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Among these approaches, the amplicon-based metagenomics relies on specific genetic markers, such as the 16S rRNA gene, while the shotgun metagenomics annotates the whole bacterial DNA. Despite the 16S being the gold standard marker, studies highlighted its inefficiency in characterising and quantifying divergent bacterial groups such as the Candidate Phyla Radiation. On the other hand, shotgun metagenomics is highly informative and accurate but it is more expensive and requires computational resources and time. In this study, we propose RecA as a pan-bacterial genetic marker, particularly suitable for the Candidate Phyla Radiation. Indeed, we found that applying a Random Forest machine learning model on RecA amino acid sequences provides an accurate and fast taxonomic annotation across the whole bacterial tree of life. Ultimately, we produced Forestax, a tool for the characterisation and quantification of bacterial communities in metagenomics data, on the basis of RecA sequences. The analyses showed that RecA-based metagenomics has a taxonomic accuracy comparable to other multi-gene approaches, reinforcing RecA as a powerful marker for taxonomic annotation in bacteria. In perspective, RecA could be considered as a broad-spectrum marker for amplicon-based studies to overcome the limits of 16S rRNA.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Using this, we identify a novel cellular behavior associated with electrical signaling, in which ciliary arrest is coupled with apical-basal contraction of the cell. This behavior, and the associated calcium transients, are synchronized in the multicellular state and result in coordinated ciliary arrest and colony wide contraction, suggesting information is spread amongst the cells.

The type of architecture that evolves depends strongly on migration rate, as weakly selected loci experience swamping and do not make stable contributions to divergence. Simulations from previous studies showed that even when mutations are strongly selected and should resist migration swamping, the architecture of adaptation can collapse and become transient at high mutation rates. Here, we use an analytical two-population model to study how this ""mutation swamping"" phenomenon depends upon population size, strength of selection, and parameters determining mutation effects. To do this, we developed a mathematical theory based on the diffusion approximation to predict the threshold mutation rate above which swamping occurs, and find that this performs well across wide range of parameter space, based on comparisons with individual-based simulations. The mutation swamping threshold depends most strongly on the average effect size of mutations, and weakly on the strength of selection, but is only minimally affected by population size. Across a wide range of parameter space, we observe that mutation swamping occurs when the trait-wide mutation rate is 10-3-10-2, suggesting that this phenomenon is potentially relevant to complex traits with a large mutational target. On the other hand, based on the apparent stability of genetic architecture in many classic examples of local adaptation, our theory suggests that per-trait mutation rates are often relatively low.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

The hypervirulence is strongly linked to the overproduction of hypermucovisous capsule, but the underlining regulatory mechanism of hypermucoviscosity (HMV) has been elusive, especially at the post-transcriptional level mediated by small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs). Using a recently developed RNA interactome profiling approach, we interrogate the Hfq-associated sRNA regulatory network and establish the intracellular RNA-RNA interactome in HvKP. Our data reveal numerous interactions between sRNAs and HMV-related mRNAs, and identify a plethora of sRNAs that repress or promote HMV. One of the strongest repressors of HMV is ArcZ, which is activated by catabolite regulator CRP and targets many HMV-related genes including mlaA and fbp. We discover that MlaA and its function in phospholipid transport is crucial for capsule retention and HMV, inactivation of which abolished Klebsiella virulence in mice. ArcZ overexpression significantly reduced bacterial burden in mice and reduced HMV in multiple carbapenem-resistant and hypervirulent clinical isolates with diverse genetic background, indicating it is a potent RNA inhibitor of bacterial pneumonia with therapeutic potential. In summary, our work unravels a comprehensive map of the RNA-RNA interaction network of HvKP and identifies a novel CRP-ArcZ-MlaA regulatory circuit of HMV, providing mechanistic insights into the posttranscriptional virulence control in a superbug of global concern.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Pristionchus pacificus displays two types of feeding behaviours: predatory and bacterial feeding. Previously, we showed that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays important roles in regulating predatory feeding in P. pacificus. However, the role of other neurotransmitters in predatory feeding remains unclear. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated mutants of the dense-core vesicle (DCV)-based neuropeptide secretion system and genes related to seven neurotransmitters. Predatory assays revealed that the vesicular glutamate transporter Ppa-EAT-4, glutamic acid decarboxylase Ppa-UNC-25 which is involved in GABA synthesis, and the calcium-dependent activator protein for DCV secretion Ppa-UNC-31, play roles in predatory feeding behaviour. We assessed the pharyngeal movement necessary for predation as well as locomotion rate in these mutants. While the Ppa-eat-4 and Ppa-unc-31 mutants decreased predation movement, the Ppa-unc-25 mutant showed a reduction only in bacterial events compared to wild type animals. Additionally, Ppa-unc-25 and Ppa-unc-31 decreased in motor movement, potentially reducing predation efficiency. Together, these results suggest that glutamate, GABA and DCV secretion modulate feeding behaviours in P. pacificus. Our mutant collection of neurotransmitter-related genes will be useful for future analysis of neurobiology and behavioural evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

In the endoplasmic reticulum, two distinct metal ion dependent enzyme families (i.e., multifunctional lysyl hydroxylases-glucosyltransferases LH/PLODs and galactosyltransferases GLT25D/COLGALT) alternatively operate on collagen lysine side chains ultimately generating the highly conserved -(1,2)-glucosyl-{beta}-(1,O)-galactosyl-5-hydroxylysine pattern. Malfunctions in the collagen lysine post-translational modification machinery is linked to multiple developmental pathologies as well as extracellular matrix alterations causing enhanced cellular proliferation and invasiveness of several solid tumors, prompting for an in-depth characterization of LH/PLOD and GLT25D/COLGALT enzyme families. Here, we present an integrative molecular study of GLT25D1/COLGALT, highlighting an elongated head-to-head homodimeric assembly characterized by an N-terminal segment of each monomer wrapping around its dimerization partner. Each monomer encompasses two Rossman fold-type domains (GT1 and GT2) separated by an extended linker. Both domains were found capable of binding Mn2+ cofactors and UDP--galactose donor substrates, resulting in four candidate catalytic sites per dimer. Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies identify the C-terminal GT2 domain as the functional GLT25D1/COLGALT1 catalytic site, highlighting an unprecedented Glu-Asp-Asp motif critical for metal ion binding, and suggesting structural roles for the N-terminal GT1 essential for correct quaternary structure assembly. Conversely, dimerization was not a requirement for GLT25D1/COLGALT1 enzymatic activity in vitro, suggesting that the elongated enzyme homodimer assembly, resembling that of LH/PLOD binding partners, could represent a functional hallmark for correct recognition and successful processing of collagen lysine residues.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy. Furthermore, simulation demonstrates that repeated boosters, given every few months, are needed to maintain this misleading impression of efficacy.

Yet, diversification in parasite phenotype and genotype may have important clinical and epidemiological consequences. Our aim was to determine if the constraints associated with the infection of different host tissues lead to the emergence and co-existence of multiple parasite sub-populations with different phenotypes. We tested this hypothesis by injecting the most widespread bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia, isolated from three tissues of the common pill-bug Armadillidium vulgare into uninfected individuals, and by monitoring the growth rate and virulence of each bacterial sub-population in the new hosts. Our results highlighted that within-host environmental heterogeneity led to diverse phenotypes in Wolbachia. This variability did not appear to result from genomic variation, but from phenotypic plasticity. Indeed, we did not find recurrent tissue-specific genomic variation among infected individuals. Whole genome resequencing of the Wolbachia sub-populations and pedigree data from the animals used in this study demonstrated however the coexistence of two Wolbachia variants within our host lineage for almost 20 years. Our results further supported the stability of the Wolbachia genome with respect to small-scale genomic variation, in agreement with reports on other symbiotic systems.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

The inherent complexity of this phenomenon necessitates innovative approaches to comprehend and compare the mechanisms driving pattern formation. Here, we unveil the multistability of bacterial colony patterns orchestrated by a simple synthetic bistable switch. Utilizing quantitative imaging and spatially resolved transcriptome approaches, we explore the deterministic process of a ring-like colony pattern formation from a single cell. This process is primarily driven by bifurcation events programmed by the gene regulatory network and microenvironmental cues. Additionally, we observe a noise-induced process amplified by the founder effect, leading to patterns of symmetry-break during range expansion. The degrees of asymmetry are profoundly influenced by the initial conditions of single progenitor cells during the nascent stages of colony development. These findings underscore how the process of range expansion enables individual cells, exposed to a uniform growth-promoting environment, to exhibit inherent capabilities in generating emergent, self-organized behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

However, there are major observable and unobservable confounding factors that can contribute to the estimated differences. Males have larger head sizes than females. Head size differences not only act as a confounding factor in studying sex differences in the brain, but also impact its anatomy and functioning. In this work, we seek to disentangle the effect of head size from sex in studying sex differentiated aging trajectories, its relation to canonical functional networks and cytoarchitectural classes, brain allometry, cognition. Using the UK Biobank (UKBB) neuroimaging data (N = 35,732 participants, 19,281 females, 44-82 years of age), we created a subsample (N = 11,294) where females (N = 5,657) and males were matched by their total intracranial volume (TIV) and age, a subsample that maintains the UKBB sample distribution, one matched only by age, and one that exaggerated the TIV difference between sexes. We then modeled the aging trajectories at both regional and vertex-wise levels in the four subsamples, and compared the estimations of the models. Our results show that when females and males have the same head size, the overall sex estimations tend towards zero, suggesting that most of the variability results from head size differences. Our approach also revealed bidirectional sex differences in brain neuroanatomy previously masked by the effect of head size. Further, the scaling relationship between regional and total brain volume remains fairly consistent across the lifespan and is not sex differentiated overall. We evaluated how the results of cognitive tests with perceived sex differences are influenced and explained by head size and found that although the correlation between TIV and cognitive scores is low, the matching process changes the direction of the effect sizes of differences between sexes in ""verbal and numerical reasoning"" and ""working memory"" cognitive domains. Taken together, employing a matching approach that is widely used in causal modeling studies, we provide new evidence for disentanglement of sex differences in the brain from head size as a biological confound.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

One approach for treating these diseases is to bind small molecules to the structured RNAs. Both Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) are caused by a r(CUG) repeat expansion, or r(CUG)exp. The RNA folds into a hairpin structure with a periodic array of 1x1 nucleotide UU loops (5'CUG/3'GUC; where the underlined nucleotides indicate the Us in the internal loop) that sequester various RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and hence the source of its gain-of-function. Here, we report NMR-refined structures of single 5'CUG/3'GUC motifs in complex with three different small molecules, a di-guandinobenzoate (1), a derivative of 1 where the guanidino groups have been exchanged for imidazole (2), and a quinoline with improved drug-like properties (3). These structures were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and simulated annealing with restrained molecular dynamics (MD). Compounds 1, 2, and 3 formed stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions with the 5'CUG/3'GUC motif. Compound 3 also formed van der Waals interactions with the internal loop. The global structure of each RNA-small molecule complexes retains an A-form conformation, while the internal loops are still dynamic but to a lesser extent compared to the unbound form. These results aid our understanding of ligand-RNA interactions and enable structure-based design of small molecules with improved binding affinity for and biological activity against r(CUG)exp.

However, it remains unclear which stage of memory oxytocin affects to enhance face memory. Our study explored oxytocin's potential to selectively enhance the consolidation of social memories, specifically human faces, and whether this effect varies between genders. In two preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with heterosexual participants (total N=294, comprising 149 males and 145 females), we explored how oxytocin affects memory consolidation. We administered oxytocin immediately after encoding (i.e., Study1) and 30 minutes before retrieval in a parallel study (i.e., Study2). This design allowed us to confirm that oxytocin's effects were indeed due to consolidation rather than retrieval. We found that administering oxytocin post-encoding, but not before-retrieval, significantly improved female participants' ability to recognize male faces 24 hours later, with no similar enhancement observed in males recognizing opposite-gender faces. Together with our analyses of social placebo effects and approachability rating during encoding, we concluded that oxytocin enhanced consolidation of long-term social memories in humans. Our results not only advance the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying social memory consolidation but also highlight oxytocin as a pharmacological tool for selectively enhancing human memory consolidation.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Bordetella parapertussis (Bpp) contributes significantly to the burden of whooping cough (pertussis), shares vaccine antigens with Bordetella pertussis (Bp), and both pathogens are phylogenetically related and ecological competitors. Bp vaccine antigen-coding genes have accumulated variation, including pertactin disruptions, after introduction of acellular vaccines in the 1990s. We aimed to evaluate evolutionary parallelisms in Bpp, even though pertussis vaccines were designed against Bp.

We investigated the temporal evolution of Bpp sublineages, by sequencing 242 Bpp isolates collected in France, the USA and Spain between 1937 and 2019, spanning pre-vaccine and two vaccines eras.

We estimated the evolutionary rate of Bpp at 2.12x10-7 substitutions per site{middle dot}year-1, with a most recent common ancestor of all sequenced isolates around year 1877, and found that pertactin deficiency in Bpp was driven by 18 disruptive mutations, including deletion prn:{Delta}G-1895 estimated to have occurred around 1998 and observed in 73.8% (149/202) of post-2007 isolates. In addition, we detected two mutations in the bvgA-fhaB intergenic region (controlling expression of the master transcriptional regulator BvgA and the filamentous hemagglutinin), that became fixed in the early 1900s.

Our findings suggest early adaptation of Bpp to humans through modulation of the bvgAS regulon, and a rapid adaptation through the loss of pertactin expression, representing a late evolutionary parallelism concomitant with acellular vaccination against whooping cough.

IMPORTANCEVaccination against Bordetella pertussis (Bp) has strongly affected the recent evolution of this main agent of whooping cough. Whether it may have done so co-incidentally on Bordetella parapertussis (Bpp), which is genetically and ecologically very similar to Bp, has not been described in detail. Our findings show striking evolutionary parallelisms of Bpp with Bp, including early changes in a critical regulatory region, and strong evidence of adaptation to vaccine-driven population immunity, even though whooping cough vaccines were not designed explicitly against Bpp. The rapid populational loss of pertactin in countries where acellular pertussis vaccines are used may also reduce protection by vaccination against Bpp, the second agent of whooping cough.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

PV-INs are particularly vulnerable to cell loss, potentially due to their increased metabolic demands arising from their uniquely high level of electrical activity, which render them susceptible to metabolic pressure. Here, we use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNAseq) data from a rodent model of TBI, as well as human TBI data, and demonstrate PV-INs have unique metabolic specializations that are lost after injury and can be rescued by in vivo treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose. We generated a novel PV-IN transcriptional identity module comprised primarily of genes encoding specialized ion channels, metabolic enzymes, and synaptic machinery, that identifies heterogenous subsets of injury-associated PV-INs with loss of PV-IN transcriptional identity. We show that changes in metabolic specialization are coupled to changes in transcriptional identity in PV-INs and implicate the PV-IN-enriched transcriptional co-activator, Ppargc1a, as a key driver of PV-IN transcriptional metabolic dysfunction. We also identify a family of long non-coding RNAs enriched in this subset of transcriptionally dysfunctional PV-INs that negatively correlates with PV-IN metabolic specialization.

Traditional alignment-based methods, though widely used, are computationally intense and reliant on extensive reference databases, often failing to detect novel pathogens due to their low sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, conventional machine learning techniques, while promising, require large annotated datasets and extensive feature engineering and are prone to overfitting. Addressing these challenges, we introduce PathoLM, a cutting-edge pathogen language model optimized for the identification of pathogenicity in bacterial and viral sequences. Leveraging the strengths of pre-trained DNA models such as the Nucleotide Transformer, PathoLM requires minimal data for fine-tuning, thereby enhancing pathogen detection capabilities. It effectively captures a broader genomic context, significantly improving the identification of novel and divergent pathogens. We developed a comprehensive data set comprising approximately 30 species of viruses and bacteria, including ESKAPEE pathogens, seven notably virulent bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics. Additionally, we curated a species classification dataset centered specifically on the ESKAPEE group. In comparative assessments, PathoLM dramatically outperforms existing models like DciPatho, demonstrating robust zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. Furthermore, we expanded PathoLM-Sp for ESKAPEE species classification, where it showed superior performance compared to other advanced deep learning methods, despite the complexities of the task.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Spectral flow cytometry allows for high-dimensional analysis of immune cells, overcoming limitations of conventional flow cytometry. However, analyzing data from large antibody panels can be challenging using traditional bi-axial gating strategies. Here, we present a novel analysis pipeline designed to improve analysis of spectral flow cytometry. We employ this method to identify rare T cell populations in aging. We isolated splenocytes from young (2-3 months) and aged (18-19 months) female mice then stained these with a panel of 20 fluorescently labeled antibodies. Spectral flow cytometry was performed, followed by data processing and analysis using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment to perform batch correction, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction, and differential expression analysis. Our analysis of 3,776,804 T cells from 11 spleens revealed 34 distinct T cell clusters identified by surface marker expression. We observed significant differences between young and aged mice, with certain clusters enriched in one age group over the other. Naive, effector memory, and central memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets exhibited age-associated changes in abundance and marker expression. Additionally, {gamma}{delta}T cell clusters showed differential abundance between age groups. By leveraging high-dimensional analysis methods borrowed from single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we identified age-related differences in T cell subsets, providing insights into the immune aging process. This approach offers a robust, free, and easily implemented analysis pipeline for spectral flow cytometry data that may facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for age-related immune dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Recent evidence identified the proliferation of microtubules enriched in post-translationally modified tubulin as a consequence of dystrophins absence that increases the passive mechanics of the muscle fiber and the excess mechanotransduction elicited reactive oxygen species and calcium signals that promote contraction injury. Motivated by evidence that acutely normalizing the disease microtubule alterations reduced contraction injury in murine DMD muscle. (mdx), here we sought the direct impact of these microtubule alterations independent of dystrophins absence and the multitude of other changes consequent to dystrophic disease. To this end we used acute pharmacologic (epithiolone-D, EpoD; 4 hours) or genetic (vashohibin-2 and small vashohibin binding protein overexpression via AAV9; 2 weeks) strategies to effectively model the proliferation of detyrosination enriched microtubules in the mdx muscle. Quantifying in vivo nerve evoked plantarflexor function we find no alteration in peak torque nor contraction kinetics in WT mice modeling these DMD relevant MT alterations. Quantifying the susceptibility to eccentric contraction injury we show EpoD treatment proffered a small but significant protection from contraction injury while VASH/SVBP had no discernable impact. We conclude that the disease dependent MT alterations act in concert with additional cellular changes to predispose contraction injury in DMD.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

However, the outcomes of nuclear invagination remain unclear. This work identified a new function of nuclear invagination: regulating ribosome biogenesis. With expansion microscopy, we observed frequent physical contact between nuclear invaginations and nucleoli. Surprisingly, the higher the invagination curvature, the more ribosomal RNA and pre-ribosomes are made in the contacted nucleolus. By growing cells on nanopillars that generate nuclear invaginations with desired curvatures, we can increase and decrease ribosome biogenesis. Based on this causation, we repressed the ribosome levels in breast cancer and progeria cells by growing cells on low-curvature nanopillars, indicating that overactivated ribosome biogenesis can be rescued by reshaping nuclei. Mechanistically, high-curvature nuclear invaginations reduce heterochromatin and enrich nuclear pore complexes, which promote ribosome biogenesis. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a foundation for further studies on nuclear deformation.

Neonatal research offers a pivotal opportunity to address this long-standing debate. Given that postnatal environmental influences (e.g., gender socialisation) are minimal at birth, any sex differences observed at this stage can be more readily attributed to prenatal influences. Here, we assessed on-average sex differences in global and regional brain volumes in 514 newborns (236 birth-assigned females and 278 birth-assigned males) using data from the developing Human Connectome Project. On average, males had significantly larger intracranial and total brain volumes, even after controlling for birth weight. After controlling for total brain volume, females showed higher total cortical gray matter volumes, whilst males showed higher total white matter volumes. After controlling for total brain volume in regional comparisons, females had increased white matter volumes in the corpus callosum and increased gray matter volumes in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri (posterior parts), left anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral parietal lobes, and right caudate nucleus. Males had increased gray matter volumes in the right medial and inferior temporal gyrus (posterior part) and right subthalamic nucleus. Effect sizes ranged from small for regional comparisons to large for global comparisons. While postnatal experiences likely amplify sex differences in the brain, our findings demonstrate that several global and regional on-average sex differences are already present at birth.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

We detected five well-supported clades, three representing local transmission chains that were mostly restricted to the 2022 virus spread, one supported year-long maintenance encompassing samples from 2022 and 2023, and one new importation from Europe in 2023. Our results provide new insights into the geographic extent of community transmission and its association with viral diversity during the more pronounced 2022 mpox upsurge and during the following lower incidence endemic transmission phase. These findings highlight the power of continued genomic surveillance to uncover hidden transmission chains to understand viral dynamics and inform public health responses.

Methods like AlphaFold have revolutionized protein structure prediction based only on the amino-acid sequence. However, proteins often appear in multiple different conformations, and it is highly relevant to resolve the full conformational distribution. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo EM) is a powerful tool for capturing a large number of images of a given protein, frequently in different conformations (referred to as particles). The images are, however, very noisy projections of the protein, and traditional methods for cryo EM reconstruction are limited to recovering a single, or a few, conformations. In this paper, we introduce cryoSPHERE, a deep learning method that takes as input a nominal protein structure, e.g. from AlphaFold, learns how to divide it into segments, and how to move these as approximately rigid bodies to fit the different conformations present in the cryo EM dataset. This formulation is shown to provide enough constraints to recover meaningful reconstructions of single protein structures. This is illustrated in three examples where we show consistent improvements over the current state-of-the-art for heterogeneous reconstruction.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

The prediction and analysis of gene essentiality can advance our understanding of basic life and human diseases, and further boost the development of new drugs. Wet lab methods for identifying cell essential genes are often costly, time-consuming, and laborious. As a complement, computational methods have been proposed to predict essential genes by integrating multiple biological data sources. Most of these methods are evaluated on model organisms. However, prediction methods for human essential genes are still limited and the relationship between human gene essentiality and different biological information still needs to be explored. In addition, exploring suitable deep learning techniques to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning methods and improve prediction accuracy is also important and interesting. We propose a snapshot ensemble deep neural network method, DeEPsnap, to predict human essential genes. DeEPsnap integrates sequence features derived from DNA and protein sequence data with features extracted or learned from multiple types of functional data, such as gene ontology, protein complex, protein domain, and protein-protein interaction network. More than 200 features from these biological data are extracted/learned which are integrated together to train a series of cost-sensitive deep neural networks by utilizing multiple deep learning techniques. The proposed snapshot mechanism enables us to train multiple models without increasing extra training effort and cost. The experimental results of 10-fold cross-validation show that DeEPsnap can accurately predict human gene essentiality with an average AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of 96.1%, the average AUPRC (Area under the Precision-Recall curve) of 93.82%, the average accuracy of 92.21%, and the average F1 measure about 80.62%. In addition, the comparison of experimental results shows that DeEPsnap outperforms several popular traditional machine learning models and deep learning models. We have demonstrated that the proposed method, DeEPsnap, is effective for predicting human essential genes.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719266945338

However, the resurgent interest in the drugs as therapeutics has also prompted a search for novel agents with more specific pharmacological activities than the rather promiscuous classical psychedelics. Here we present the results of an elaborate preclinical characterization of one such compound, LPH-5 [(S)-3-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperidine]. LPH-5 was found to be a potent partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and to exhibit pronounced selectivity for this receptor over the related 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in a range of functional assays. LPH-5 (0.375 - 12.0 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently induced head-twitch responses (HTR) in Sprague Dawley rats, with substantial 5-HT2AR engagement being observed at 0.5-1.0 mg/kg. Acute administration of LPH-5 (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced robust antidepressant-like effects in Flinders Sensitive Line rats and adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated Sprague Dawley rats, and LPH-5 (0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced significant effects in a recently developed Wistar Kyoto rat model proposed to reflect the long-term antidepressant-like effects produced by psychedelics in humans. In conclusion, selective 5-HT2AR activation, as mediated here by LPH- 5, seems to hold antidepressant potential, suggesting that this activity component is key for the beneficial effects of classical psychedelics. Hence, we propose that LPH-5 and other 5-HT2AR- selective agonists could hold potential as therapeutics in psychiatric disease as a new generation of psychedelic-derived antidepressant.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Ulva-associated bacteria exhibit high turnover across environmental gradients, leading to the hypothesis that bacteria contribute to the acclimation potential of the host. Yet little is known about the variation in the functional profile of Ulva-associated bacteria in relation to environmental changes. To test which microbial functions shift alongside a strong environmental gradient, we analysed microbial communities of 91 Ulva samples across a 2,000 km Atlantic-Baltic Sea salinity gradient using metagenomic sequencing. Metabolic reconstruction of 639 metagenome-assembled genomes revealed widespread potential for carbon, sulphur, nitrogen, and vitamin metabolism, including amino acid and vitamin B biosynthesis. While salinity explained 70% of taxonomic variation, it only accounted for 17% of functional variation, indicating extensive functional stability. The limited variation was attributed to typical high-salinity bacteria exhibiting enrichment in genes for thiamine, pyridoxal, and betaine biosynthesis. These metabolic modules likely contribute to oxidative stress mitigation, cellular osmotic homeostasis, and membrane stabilization in response to salinity variations. Our results emphasise the importance of functional profiling to understand the seaweed holobiont and its collective response to environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

During low arousal states such as slow wave sleep, the cortex is synchronized and dominated by low frequency rhythms coordinated across multiple regions. Although recent evidence suggests that GABAergic inhibitory neurons are key players in cortical state modulation, the in vivo circuit mechanisms coordinating synchronized activity among local and distant neocortical networks are not well understood. Here, we show that somatostatin and chondrolectin co-expressing cells (Sst-Chodl cells), a sparse and unique class of neocortical inhibitory neurons, are selectively active during low arousal states and are largely silent during periods of high arousal. In contrast to other neocortical inhibitory neurons, we show these neurons have long-range axons that project across neocortical areas. Activation of Sst-Chodl cells is sufficient to promote synchronized cortical states characteristic of low arousal, with increased spike co-firing and low frequency brain rhythms, and to alter behavioral states by promoting sleep. Contrary to the prevailing belief that sleep is exclusively driven by subcortical mechanisms, our findings reveal that these long-range inhibitory neurons not only track changes in behavioral state but are sufficient to induce both sleep-like cortical states and sleep behavior, establishing a crucial circuit component in regulating behavioral states.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Rnf is widespread in primordial organisms and the evolutionary predecessor of the Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqr)1. By running in reverse, Rnf reduces ferredoxin with NADH as reductant at the expense of the transmembrane electrochemical ion gradient and provides low potential electrons for nitrogenases as well as CO2 reductases. Yet, the molecular principles that couple the long-range electron transfer to the Na+ translocation across the membrane remain elusive. Here we resolve key functional states along the electron transfer pathway using redox-controlled cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that, in combination with biochemical functional assays and atomistic molecular simulations, provide key insight into the redox-driven Na+ pumping mechanism. We show that the reduction of the unique membrane-embedded [2Fe2S] cluster in the vestibule between the RnfA/E subunits electrostatically attracts the sodium ions, and in turn, triggers an inward/outward transition with alternating membrane access driving the Na+ pump and the reduction of NAD+. Our study unveils an ancient mechanism for redox-driven ion pumping, and provides key understanding of the fundamental principles governing energy conversion in biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Although the exact mechanisms underlying its maturation remain elusive, spontaneous activity patterns in the retina, known as retinal waves, have been shown to contribute to this developmental process. Retinal waves exhibit complex spatio-temporal statistics and contribute to the establishment of circuit connectivity and function in the visual system, including the formation of retinotopic maps and the refinement of receptive fields in downstream areas such as the thalamus and visual cortex. Recent work in mice has shown that retinal waves have statistical features matching those of natural visual stimuli, such as optic flow, suggesting that they could prime the visual system for motion processing upon vision onset. Motivated by these findings, we examined whether artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural movies show improved performance if pre-trained with retinal waves. We employed the spatio-temporally complex task of next-frame prediction, in which the ANN was trained to predict the next frame based on preceding input frames of a movie. We found that pre-training ANNs with retinal waves enhances the processing of real-world visual stimuli and accelerates learning. Strikingly, even when matching the total training time by merely replacing initial training epochs on naturalistic stimuli with exposure to retinal waves, an ANN trained on retinal waves temporarily outperforms one trained solely on natural movies. Similar to observations made in biological systems, we also found that pre-training with spontaneous activity refines the receptive field of ANN neurons. Overall, our work sheds light on the functional role of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in the processing of motion in natural scenes, suggesting it acts as a training signal to prepare the developing visual system for adult visual processing.

Author summaryBefore the onset of vision, the retina generates its own spontaneous activity, referred to as retinal waves. This activity is crucial for establishing neural connections and, hence, ensuring the proper functionality of the visual system. Recent research has shown that retinal waves exhibit statistical properties similar to those of natural visual stimuli, such as the optic flow of objects in the environment during forward motion. We investigate whether retinal waves can prepare the visual system for motion processing by pre-training artificial neural network (ANN) models with retinal waves. We tested the ANNs on next-frame prediction tasks, where the model predicts the next frame of a video based on previous frames. Our results showed that ANNs pre-trained with retinal waves exhibit faster learning on movies featuring naturalistic stimuli. Additionally, pre-training with retinal waves refined the receptive fields of ANN neurons, similar to processes seen in biological systems. Our work highlights the importance of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in preparing the visual system for motion processing in natural scenes.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

For this purpose, numerous detergents, amphipols, polymers and membrane scaffold proteins are available. The choice of the specific membrane substitute can strongly affect the proteins specific activity, stability and conformational spectrum, potentially leading to errors or misinterpretation during analysis. The bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporter MsbA is a prominent example of such environment-specific bias, resulting in apparent conformational and activity responses.

Here, we present a systematic analysis of the conformational spectrum of MsbA, stabilized in a dozen environments, using cryo-EM. Our data show pronounced structural feedback of the ABC transporter to the respective membrane mimetics. Detergents generally favour a conformation with wide separation of the nucleotide-binding domains, while nanodiscs induce the narrow conformation. Notably, only three of the dozen tested environments allow MsbA to sample the functional conformational spectrum, enabling full movement of the nucleotide-binding domains between narrow and wide inward-facing conformations. We expect this study to serve as a blueprint for other membrane proteins, even where the structural reaction to the hydrophobic environment is not directly visible but still critical for the proteins function.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945338

Many of the specimens studied have been excavated and stored for a significant duration prior to their proteomic analysis. Human handling and storage environments therefore provide ample opportunities for protein contamination onto and into specimens of interest to palaeoproteomic studies. As such, modern protein contamination limits access to endogenous proteomes. Here, we compare five approaches of bone protein decontamination applied to a Pleistocene Equus sp. bone fragment contaminated with a modern dog salivary proteome. We find that all tested methods reduce the protein contamination, but with different efficiencies. We find that a brief bleach wash is the most effective approach in removing modern protein contamination, and that no additional damage is caused to the endogenous proteome by this treatment. Next, we apply this approach to a hominin tooth found at Khudji, a Late Pleistocene archaeological site in Tajikistan. We demonstrate that a brief bleach wash removes almost all human skin protein contamination while retaining the endogenous hominin dentine proteome. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the Khudji dentine proteome allowed determination that the specimen likely represents a Neanderthal, extending the fossil evidence for Neanderthals in Central Asia.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945339

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945339

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway.

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945339

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719266945339

The central biological question about HD pathogenesis has been how the disease-causing DNA repeat expansion (CAGn) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of apparent latency. Inherited HTT alleles with a longer CAG repeat hasten disease onset; the length of this repeat also changes over time, generating somatic mosaicism, and genes that regulate DNA-repeat stability can influence HD age-at-onset. To understand the relationship between a cells CAG-repeat length and its biological state, we developed a single-cell method for measuring CAG-repeat length together with genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands from 40-45 CAGs to 100-500+ CAGs in HD-vulnerable SPNs but not in other striatal cell types, with these long DNA-repeat expansions acquired at different times by individual SPNs. Surprisingly, somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent effect upon gene expression - but neurons with 150-500+ CAGs shared profound gene-expression changes. These expression changes involved hundreds of genes, escalated alongside further CAG-repeat expansion, eroded positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, and culminated in expression of senescence/apoptosis genes. Rates of striatal neuron loss across HD stages reflected the rates at which neurons entered this biologically distorted state. Our results suggest that HTT CAG repeats in striatal neurons undergo decades of biologically quiet expansion, then, as they asynchronously cross a high threshold, cause SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that, at any moment in the course of HD, most neurons have an innocuous (but unstable) huntingtin gene, and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neurons life.","NA","biorxiv",1719266945339

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1719266945339

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
