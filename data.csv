Despite recent progress in de novo design of protein binders, there are no current methods for designing binders that recognize phosphorylated proteins and peptides; this is a challenging problem as phosphate groups are highly charged, and phosphorylation often occurs within unstructured regions. Here we introduce RoseTTAFold Diffusion 2 for Molecular Interfaces (RFD2-MI), a deep generative framework for the design of binders for protein, ligand, and covalently modified protein targets. We demonstrate the power and versatility of this method by designing binders for four critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3{varepsilon}), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR). Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach. RFD2-MI provides a generalizable all-atom diffusion framework for probing and modulating phosphorylation-dependent signaling, and more generally, for developing research tools and targeted therapeutics against post-translationally modified proteins.","[{""name"":""NIH NCI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1K99CA293001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550936

XPro1595 selectively neutralizes pathological soluble TNF while preserving neuroprotective transmembrane TNF signaling, offering a mechanistically distinct approach from current amyloid-targeting therapies.

MethodsThe MINDFuL trial was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted across 35 centers in eight countries. Participants aged 50-85 years with Early AD (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia) and elevated inflammatory biomarkers received weekly subcutaneous injections of XPro1595 (1.0 mg/kg) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the Early Mild Alzheimers Cognitive Composite (EMACC). A prospectively defined biomarker-enriched population included amyloid-positive participants with a high inflammatory burden (ADi), defined by the presence of [&ge;]2 inflammatory markers.

ResultsOf 206 randomized participants, 200 comprised the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and 100 comprised the ADi population. In the mITT analysis, no significant difference was observed in the EMACC (p=0.672). However, the ADi population showed promising signals across multiple clinical endpoints favoring XPro1595, including the EMACC (Cohens d = 0.27), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI, d = 0.23), particularly the subfactor agitation/hyperactivity (d = 0.37), and a patient-reported outcome: Goal Attainment Scale (GAS, d = 0.18). These results were consistent with biomarker changes that favored XPro1595, as plasma pTau217 (d = -0.18) and GFAP (d = -0.19) were attenuated in the ADi population. In addition, many effect sizes were larger when assessing participants with higher drug exposure. Notably, no amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were observed, even though [~]70% of the participants were APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers, and one-third had baseline microbleeds.

ConclusionsWhile XPro1595 did not meet the primary endpoint in the overall population, participants with biologically-defined AD and high inflammatory burden demonstrated consistent trends toward cognitive benefit and neuropsychiatric improvement. The complete absence of ARIA distinguishes XPro1595 from amyloid-targeting therapies and supports its potential for use in combination strategies and potentially for those at a higher risk of ARIA. These findings support selective TNF inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for persons with AD and elevated inflammatory burden.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759356550936

While open models for unconstrained ""minibinder"" design have shown great experimental promise, methods for designing binders in specific formats, such as antibodies, have lagged behind in experimental success rates. In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models. This work represents the largest reported de novo protein design and validation campaign, and one of the first open-source methods to demonstrate double-digit percentage experimental success rates for antibody binder design.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550936

Current methods are constrained by image segmentation errors and by sample defects (e.g., signal gaps, section loss). Genetic strategies promise to overcome these challenges by using easily distinguishable cell identity labels. However, multicolor approaches are spectrally limited in diversity, whereas nucleic acid barcoding lacks a cell-filling morphology signal for segmentation. Here, we introduce PRISM (Protein-barcode Reconstruction via Iterative Staining with Molecular annotations), a platform that integrates combinatorial delivery of antigenically distinct, cell-filling proteins with tissue expansion, multi-cycle imaging, barcode-augmented reconstruction, and molecular annotation. Protein barcodes increase label diversity by >750-fold over multicolor labeling and enable morphology reconstruction with intrinsic error correction. We acquired a [~]10 million m3 volume of mouse hippocampal area CA2/3, multiplexed across 23 barcode antigen and synaptic marker channels. By combining barcodes with shape information we achieve an 8x increase in automatic tracing accuracy of genetically labelled neurons. We demonstrate PRISM supports automatic proofreading across micron-scale spatial gaps and reconnects neurites across discontinuities spanning hundreds of microns. Using PRISM's molecular annotation capability, we map the distribution of synapses onto traced neural morphology, characterizing challenging synaptic structures such as thorny excrescences (TEs), and discovering a size correlation among spatially proximal TEs on the same dendrite. PRISM thus supports self-correcting neuron reconstruction with molecular context.","[{""name"":""Eric and Wendy Schmidt"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Riley and Susan Bechtel Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""James Fickel"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Hearst Foundations"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2168;""},{""name"":""The UK Medical Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2168;""},{""name"":""The Wellcome Trust"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2168;""},{""name"":""Allen Distinguished Investigator award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRJ 20226;""},{""name"":""The Harold J Newman Brain Mapping Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRJ 20023;""},{""name"":""Lisa Yang"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""HHMI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Schmidt Futures"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AG087374;1R01EB024261;1R01AG070831;1R01MH123403;1R01MH123977;""},{""name"":""Open Philanthropy"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Good Ventures"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550936

Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at [~]10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.

Significance StatementThis study tested resonance properties of the infant visual system upon perturbation. For the visual stimulation at discrete frequencies between 2 and 30Hz, the infant brain responded at 4Hz independent of the stimulation frequency. Following broadband stimulation, a perceptual echo at 4Hz emerged - resonating the 4Hz component of visual information over several cycles. These findings reveal that the 4Hz theta rhythm is an inherent processing dynamic of the infant visual system, contrasting with the 10Hz rhythm found in adults. The processing dynamics of the human visual system undergo fundamental changes from infancy into adulthood.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KO 6028/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550936

Cachexia risk concentrated around periods of disease progression and associated with inferior outcomes in nearly all cancer types. Across cancers, cachectic episodes exhibited a consistent serologic signature characterized by low albumin and hemoglobin and high levels of liver enzymes. Numerous somatic tumor genotypes, including TP53 mutation across several diseases, were associated with elevated cachexia risk. Motivated by these observations, we developed a multivariate model to predict impending risk of cachexia in lung and colorectal cancer patients. Routine clinicogenomic data is therefore a powerful resource for discovery in cachexia and other cancer-associated pathophysiologies.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759356550936

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550936

A central question is how cell wall-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are recognized and integrated to trigger immune responses. We address this question by determining the structure of the multidomain receptor IGP1 in both apo form and bound to the cellulose-derived DAMP cellotriose. Structural analyses reveal that constitutive Leucine Rich Repeat-Malectin interactions preconfigure IGP1 for ligand recognition and that the receptor features a highly specific sugar-binding pocket in the LRR domain capable of distinguishing fine variations in glycan structures. By directly sensing cello-oligomers, IGP1 acts as a cell wall sentinel that links pathogen-induced wall degradation to immune alerting, equipping plants to mount rapid and robust defense responses.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

ObjectiveTo deeply characterize FF-fibroblasts and identify programs governing their differentiation and activation.

MethodsGeoMx spatial transcriptomics was applied to IPF lung regions, comparing carefully delineated FF (excluding overlying epithelium) with areas of established fibrosis, to derive an FF-specific signature. This signature was projected onto a large single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset to identify an FF-specific fibroblast cluster, facilitating its deep characterization.

Measurements and Main ResultsGeoMx revealed 272 increased genes in FF; this FF-signature was validated against several independent spatial transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. FF-signature genes were highly enriched in a specific cluster of fibroblasts in the IPF scRNA-seq dataset. MMP11 was the most specific gene of the FF-fibroblast cluster, and was validated using in situ RNA hybridization. Furthermore, higher MMP11 bronchoalveolar lavage protein levels were found in progressive pulmonary fibrosis and were associated with worse outcome in Cox regression (HR 4.54, 95% CI 1.24-15.8). Cell-cell interaction analysis with fibroblasts and adjacent aberrant basaloid cells, detected signals that may induce the FF-fibroblast signature, including from TGF-{beta} superfamily ligands. Using trajectory and transcription factor (TF) analysis we show that the trajectory from non-FF to FF-specific fibroblasts is correlated with activation of EMT-associated TFs and deactivation of AP-1 family TFs.

ConclusionsWe identified transcriptional programs governing FF-fibroblasts, for which MMP11 serves as a novel highly-specific biomarker with prognostic significance. We highlight potential regulators whose targeting may curb pulmonary fibrosis progression.","[{""name"":""Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Association of Friends"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

We recorded neural populations from three areas of the primate frontal cortex involved in decision making to characterize neural dynamics while animals performed a standard RL task. By combining behavioral and neuron population analysis, we found a neural subspace in midcingulate (MCC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) that precisely tracked value computations.

Levels of these metabolites increase linearly with age, preceding organismal decline. Caloric restriction, a lifespan-extending intervention, mitigates these changes in the heart but not the brain.

Some fungal NLRs are known to control regulated cell death (RCD) in the context of allorecognition, the capacity to recognize conspecific nonself. However, the function of most fungal NLR genes remains unknown. Here, we characterize the evolution of the NLR repertoire in the Podospora anserina species complex. We show that the vast majority of the NLRs display effector domains known to be involved in RCD execution. Moreover, NLRs undergo more rapid gene turnover than random genes, show higher dN/dS values, and faster evolutionary rates. A subgroup of NLRs, distinguished by superstructure-forming repeats with very high sequence identity (high internal conservation, HIC), evolved independently multiple times. We found that HIC NLRs are more associated with transposable elements, exhibit higher nucleotide diversity partially driven by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), and show elevated Tajima's D values indicative of balancing selection. Furthermore, HIC NLR phylogenies do not recapitulate species relationships, which we determined is caused by both balancing selection and introgression. In addition, we identified cases of repeat exchange between distinct HIC NLR genes, implying that novel binding specificities may evolve through repeat shuffling, thereby increasing allelic diversity. Finally, we determined that NLR-like genes with HIC repeats exist outside of the fungal realm, arguing for similar dynamics in other taxa. Overall, these findings suggest that fungal NLRs evolve under diversity-enhancing mechanisms and display selective signatures consistent with a general immune function.","[{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00341;""},{""name"":""Stiftelsen Anna-Greta och Holger Crafoords fond, Stockholm, SE"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CR2023-0039;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

While motors and lysosomal surface adaptors driving this movement are well studied, how the microtubule cytoskeleton specifies lysosomal transport and its coupling to mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling remains unclear. Here, we show that tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) define the tracks that guide nutrient-responsive lysosome positioning. Using super-resolution imaging and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that lysosomes carrying active mTORC1 preferentially traffic along tyrosinated microtubules to reach the cell periphery, whereas detyrosinated microtubules restrict their motility. Nutrient stimulation enhances this outward transport, while concurrently suppressing microtubule detyrosination through mTORC1-S6K1 signaling, likely via inhibition of vasohibin activity. This ensures selective expansion of tyrosinated microtubule tracks to sustain mTORC1 signaling. Strikingly, in cancer cells where aberrant mTORC1 activity correlates with altered microtubule tyrosination, restoring microtubule detyrosination rescues mTORC1 hyperactivation and suppresses cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Thus, demonstrating that tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) define the tracks that guide the positioning of nutrient-responsive lysosomes. These findings uncover a crosstalk between mTORC1 and tubulin tyrosination/detyrosination status that couples nutrient availability to lysosomal dynamics and identify microtubule tyrosination as a regulatory node with therapeutic potential in cancer.","[{""name"":""Anusandhan National Research foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANRF CRG/2022/008391;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

Predictors and outcomes of Long COVID-19 were evaluated in hospitalized and ambulatory patients aged <16 years receiving treatment during 2021-2023 at the University Hospital of the West Indies, Jamaica. Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study, approved by the University Ethics Committee, extracted medical records data from ill SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and then surveyed this cohort for symptoms of Long COVID-19. Poisson regression models accounted for varying follow-up times after acute COVID-19 and generated univariate and multivariable models for predictors of Long COVID-19. Results: Forty-seven percent of the 74 survey responders met the WHO 2023 pediatric criteria for Long COVID-19. Common symptoms of Long COVID-19 included cough, chest tightness, fatigue, congestion, ageusia, anosmia, anorexia, and insomnia. Acute illness symptoms associated with Long COVID-19 included fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia, abdominal pain, confusion, brain fog, persistent chest tightness, cough, nasal congestion, ageusia, anosmia, insomnia, and chest pain (IRR=1.61-2.56; p=0.000-0.034). Between those with and without Long COVID-19, there were no significant differences in demographics, comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 variant, site of care, functional impairment and quality of life. Acute illness univariate Long COVID-19 predictors were vomiting, abdominal pain, ageusia, fatigue, confusion, brain fog, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C) (p<0.05; IRR>1.0). Multivariable composite predictors were MIS-C, vomiting, and ageusia (Pseudo R2:11.9%; p<0.001). Conclusion: This 47% prevalence of Long COVID-19 in pediatric patients implies potential negative outcomes in productivity, academic performance, and comorbidity development.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759356550937

Although impaired angiogenesis is commonly observed in BRONJ, the underlying vascular mechanisms remain poorly understood, impeding the development of effective treatments. In this study, we integrated whole-organ tissue-clearing imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and proteomics to construct a multimodal atlas of the mandibular microenvironment in both mouse and human BRONJ. Our findings revealed gross vascular and lymphatic rarefaction in BRONJ, along with 4 endothelial subtypes uniformly exhibiting aberrant upregulation of Col2a1. Moreover, fibroblasts and macrophages emerged as key endothelial interactors, collectively underscoring dysregulation of the endothelium-matrix-immune axis. Unlike homeostatic Dmp1/Tfap2a fibroblasts and Stab1 macrophages, BRONJ lesions featured pathological Lrrc15/Chad fibroblasts and Il6 macrophages, which promote ectopic chondrogenesis and inflammation. Mechanistically, BRONJ activated the COL2A1-CD44 axis (EC-to-fibroblast/macrophage signaling) and COL2A1-SDC4 axis (EC-to-fibroblast signaling), whereas lineage tracing excluded endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), implicating extracellular matrix remodeling as the driver of dysfunction. Cross-species validation in human mandibles further confirmed vascular-lymphatic dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and aberrant chondrogenesis. Overall, this study establishes vascular and lymphatic dysfunction as a central pathological hallmark of BRONJ, driving matrix remodeling dysregulation and immune-inflammatory imbalance, and identifies the COL2A1-CD44/SDC4 axis as a potential therapeutic target for BRONJ.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Nature Science Foundations of China"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

Understanding the mechanism behind OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides spp. is necessary to determine their role in the gut. Recent studies showed that mutation of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 1 increased OMV production in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) by regulating members of its downstream regulon. Additional members of the Dma family have been identified, but very little is known regarding their roles in Bt. Here, we investigate the role of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 2 (Dma2) in controlling OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employ biochemical and proteomic analyses to show that mutation of dma2 increases OMV production in a manner that is dependent on the expression of its cognate sigma factor, das2. The precise mechanism by which dma2 increases OMV biogenesis remains elusive. However, transcriptome analyses revealed that{Delta} dma2 has decreased expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that primarily target host-associated glycans. Follow-up comparative proteomics showed that the PUL repertoire was most impacted in the OMV fraction. In vitro growth assessments showed that{Delta} dma2 exhibits delayed growth in the presence of select host-associated glycans. Colonization studies in mice revealed that{Delta} dma2 is outcompeted by the wild-type in the gut, which indicates that dma2 is a key determinant of colonization fitness in Bt. Altogether, these findings expand our knowledge of the Dma familys role in OMV biogenesis and demonstrates their importance in Bacteroides physiology.

ImportanceDual membrane-spanning anti-sigma factors (Dma) are a novel class of regulatory system found solely amongst Bacteroidota. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of Dma1 in vesiculation, but the overall role of the Dma family in Bacteroides physiology remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Dma2 modulates vesiculation and regulates the expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that target host-associated glycans. In vivo studies revealed that Dma2 is an important fitness determinant when competing against kin bacteria. This work begins characterizing the multifaceted involvement of Dma2 in OMV biogenesis, PUL regulation, and colonization fitness.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

EC significantly reduced alpha power. EC also tended to increase neural complexity, unlike other states in which consciousness is absent (e.g., sleep, anesthesia, disorders of consciousness). Our results indicate that the neural correlates of EC are distinct from other states that induce loss of consciousness and that complexity is not a sufficient condition for consciousness, while also providing new insights into the implications of advanced meditation for human flourishing.","[{""name"":""Dimension Giving Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Tan Teo Charitable Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

Today, images of biological structures can be acquired using different imaging technologies and at increasing resolutions. However, identifying relevant structural features in three-dimensional (3D) images remains a significant challenge. 3D image segmentation is usually performed using deep-learning segmentation models. Such models are trained on manually annotated and segmented, dataset-specific images. Consequently, they rarely generalize across datasets. Here, we overcome these limitations with TopoTome, an unsupervised 3D image segmentation and analysis algorithm. TopoTome is based on topological data analysis, and conceptually distinct from standard clustering and deep learning image analysis models. It encodes the 3D image directly in topological space. Then, it performs unsupervised clustering to detect and segment features represented by salient and spatially coherent voxel intensity gradients. We demonstrate on simple, complex, synthetic and real-world 3D image data that it outperforms all 3D clustering algorithms. Its segmentation ranks with or outperforms best-in-class deep learning 3D image segmentation software. Beyond image segmentation, it provides streamlined topological data analysis of 3D images, advancing 3D image analysis from conventional mesh volumetry to structural topology. Owing to its conceptually different topological data analysis core, TopoTome does not need prior information and tuning to generalize across different imaging modalities, including fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. We show it also readily generalizes across biological subjects, such as different species, organs and cells. TopoTome is thus one of the most versatile and accurate unsupervised 3D image segmentation algorithms.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

How do memories that are seemingly inaccessible persistently influence cognitive processes and behaviors throughout life? Rodent studies have demonstrated that forgotten infantile memories remain encoded as latent ""infantile memory engrams"" (iEngrams) within neuronal circuits, capable of memory reinstatement under artificial experimental conditions. Still, the network mechanisms underpinning the natural reinstatement of a forgotten infantile memory are unknown. Here, we show that infantile memories, though physiologically irretrievable in adults, remain stored within hippocampal circuits and their engrams contribute to hippocampal network dynamics. Crucially, reinstating these memories requires a carefully orchestrated network process. An initial contextual reminder primes the hippocampal network to increase activity of the iEngram during a subsequent aversive reminder, which tags iEngram neurons for offline reactivation. This reactivation facilitates the integration of previously latent infantile memories with novel neuronal ensembles, reinstating behavior consistent with the original memory. These findings critically advance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying physiological memory encoding, retrieval, and reinstatement across development. Furthermore, they delineate the temporal boundaries and underlying physiological substrate of the process by which a latent representation becomes associated with a novel neuronal substrate, suggesting potential interventions to prevent the maladaptive reinstatement of traumatic infantile memories.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-ST2019 850769;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CEGP3_194220;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

To address this we employed genetic, proteomics, and archaeozoological techniques to assess faunal remains from the Late Bronze assemblage of Haugheys Fort (Armagh) and medieval assemblage of Carrickfergus (Antrim). We identify these specimens as goats using proteomics and genetics, and additionally determine their molecular sex.

Genomic data recovered from a Haugheys Fort goat reveals a three-millenia genetic connection between herds in the Late Bronze Age, medieval period, and the indigenous Irish breed extant today, the Old Irish Goat. We additionally find varying levels of inbreeding within goats from the settlement of Carrickfergus, suggesting possible mixed use of herds within medieval Irish society. Our results demonstrate the continuing potential of combining archaeological and biomolecular techniques to clarify existing ambiguities and at the same time reveal new facets of the past.","[{""name"":""EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/K039660/1; EP/M028127/1;""},{""name"":""Northern Way Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""885729-AncestralWeave;101055195-ANSOC;""},{""name"":""Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21/PATH-S/9515(T);GOIPG/2023/4390;""},{""name"":""AHRC Northern Bridge Doctoral Training Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

Our model predicts hysteresis in pulling-recoiling cycles and out-of-equilibrium responses, consistent with recent single-chromosome stretching experiments. We further find that loop extrusion provides mechanical robustness to chromatin by promoting compaction while enabling rapid structural recovery after stress.

However, we know that environmental cues can also regulate AgRP neurons, since cues that predict future food intake rapidly inhibit AgRP neurons. But is the converse true: can the prediction of future fasting rapidly activate AgRP neurons? Here we show that such rapid fasting activation of AgRP neurons does occur. This fasting response is driven by excitatory input from paraventricular hypothalamic neurons expressing Sim2, which are bidirectionally sensitive to predictions of future energy state. In this way, cognitively-processed contextual information conveyed by PVHSim2 neurons strongly activates AgRP neurons. Lastly, chronic silencing of PVHSim2 neurons causes persistent hypophagia. This PVHSim2 to AgRP neuron circuit, by anticipating and preventing negative energy balance, provides an important new dimension of hunger regulation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

We systematically examine synthetic architectures inspired by mammalian cortical connectivity and find that sparse, modular, and hierarchical networks achieve superior performance, relative to random, small-world, or core-periphery graphs, but only when reciprocity is constrained.

DESIGNThe Phase IIb/III ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week trial with prespecified gene or GWAS identified genetic variant populations related to the mechanism of the pharmacological intervention.

OBJECTIVEProviding evidence of improved Precision Medicine neurology clinical treatment responses with optimal blarcamesine dose for up to [~]70% of AD patients within prespecified SIGMAR1 (ABCLEAR1) and GWAS identified COL24A1 (ABCLEAR2) and SIGMAR1/COL24A1 (ABCLEAR3) non-missense gene populations. Describing once-daily, oral therapeutic intervention of blarcamesine in early AD, with a differentiated upstream and constitutional mechanism of action by enhancing autophagy through SIGMAR1 activation and restoration of cellular homeostasis.

SETTINGMulticenter - 52 medical research centers/hospitals in 5 countries.

INTERVENTION508 participants with Early AD (Stage 3) were randomized to receive blarcamesine (n = 338) oral capsules once daily either in medium dose group (30 mg) or in high dose group (50 mg) or placebo (n = 170) for 48 weeks. An open-label-extension study ATTENTION-AD, continued for up to 192 weeks.

MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURESFurther improved clinical and biomarker outcomes of the ABCLEAR2 and ABCLEAR3 populations were accretive to the previously reported intent-to-treat (ITT) and prespecified ABCLEAR1 populations. The co-primary cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed as changes in ADAS-Cog13 and ADCS-ADL from baseline to 48 weeks. The outcomes include the secondary outcome CDR-SB as well as patient assessed clinical outcomes CGI-I, NPI-Q and QoL-AD (Quality of Life AD Patient) as well as biomarkers global brain volume changes measured by MRI. All clinical endpoints were analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), and volumetric MRI scans were analyzed by general linear model.

RESULTSThe ITT population (mean age, 73.7 years; 225 [48.7%] women), consisted of 462 randomized participants, with ABCLEAR1 population comprising of 300 participants, ABCLEAR2 population of 336 participants and ABCLEAR3 of 222 participants. In both the ABCLEAR2 and ABCLEAR3 populations, the co-primary outcomes as well as all other clinical outcomes were statistically significant. ABCLEAR3 blarcamesine group vs. placebo at Week 48 (ADAS-Cog13 difference of -4.179 [95% CI -6.512, -1.845]; P=0.0005; ADCS-ADL difference of +3.131 [95%CI 0.720, 5.542]; P=0.0111; CDR-SB difference of -1.076 [95% CI -1.645, -0.508]; P=0.0002; QoL-AD Patient improvement from baseline of 0.334 [95% CI -1.164, 1.833] and difference of 1.848 [95% CI 0.455, 3.241]; P=0.0095). The clinical outcomes were strongest in the blarcamesine 30 mg cohort (ADAS-Cog13 difference of -4.739 [95% CI -7.370, -2.108]; P=0.0004; ADCS-ADL difference of +4.245 [95%CI 1.518, 6.972]; P=0.0024; CDR-SB difference of -1.414 [95% CI -2.054, -0.775]; P<0.0001; QoL-AD Patient improvement from baseline of 0.182 [95% CI -1.472, 1.835]; and difference of 1.651 [95% CI 0.455, 3.241]; P=0.0392). Whole brain volume loss in blarcamesine group vs. placebo was significantly further decreased from ITT population (37.6%, P=0.0019) to ABCLEAR3 population (44.5%, P=0.0019). Participants in the 30 mg group ABCLEAR3 full safety population with [&ge;]1 serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 10 participants (12.7%) in the blarcamesine and 6 (9.1%) in the placebo group. Common TEAEs included dizziness, which was transient and mostly mild to moderate in severity. There were no deaths in the blarcamesine group and 1 in the placebo group.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEBlarcamesine group demonstrated a balanced safety profile with no associated neuroimaging adverse events. The respective once-daily oral 30 mg blarcamesine cohort in the respective ABCLEAR1, ABCLEAR2, and ABCLEAR3 populations demonstrates further improvement of the already adequate safety profile of the ITT population and hence representing the dose with the most balanced benefit-to-risk ratio. In both ABCLEAR2 and ABCLEAR3 populations significant slowing in decline and even stabilization of clinical worsening was demonstrated. Blarcamesine group vs. placebo was 75.9% reduction in decline at 48 weeks in the total blarcamesine group and was 84.7% in the 30 mg dose group, respectively on the prespecified co-primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13 in the ABCLEAR3 population. Blarcamesine demonstrated consistently significantly improved clinical effect for all clinical endpoints, which was in accordance with significant and further reduced brain atrophy. Furthermore, a significant absolute improvement in Quality of Life (QoL-AD) scores indicating a reversal of negative trajectory for Alzheimers disease patients from baseline to end of trial was observed. The Phase IIb/III ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 clinical study confirmed blarcamesines consistent efficacy leading to improved cognitive stabilization with continued benefit in the open-label-extension study ATTENTION-AD up to 192 weeks. Evidenced by the Precision Medicine paradigm, including in a prespecified ABCLEAR1 population, a consistent significant improvement for all clinical endpoints in the ABCLEAR2 and ABCLEAR3 populations, respectively, was demonstrated. Coupled with a convenient once daily, oral pill administration, blarcamesine could represent a novel treatment option for up to [~]70% of early AD patients benefiting from further improved outcomes using directed Precision Medicine to alleviate significant medical and economic burden.

Better understanding of how this immunosurveillance operates could improve the treatment of neurological diseases. Here, using a novel genetically engineered mouse model of ZFTA-RELA ependymoma4-a childhood brain tumour-we characterised an immune circuit between the tumour and antigen presenting, haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the skull bone marrow. The presentation of antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by HSPCs to CD4+ T cells, biased HSPC lineages toward myelopoiesis and polarised CD4+ T-cells to regulatory T cells (T- regs), culminating in tumour immunotolerance. Remarkably, a single infusion of antibodies directed against cytokines enriched in the CSF of mice bearing ZFTA-RELA ependymomas, choroid plexus carcinomas or Group-3 medulloblastoma-all aggressive childhood brain tumours-disrupted this process and caused profound tumour regression. These data unmask a mechanism by which skull bone marrow-derived HSPCs and CD4+ T cells cooperate to promote the immunotolerance of childhood brain tumours.

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

We conducted long-term continuous monitoring of locusts raised in semi-natural arenas with either clumped or distributed resources. Our findings reveal that clumped overnight roosting led to an increased propensity for coordinated marching the following day, a key precursor of swarm formation. These patterns became clearer during larval development, driving divergence in social affinity and group dynamics between habitat groups. At the molecular level, transcriptomic analysis identified a narrow set of differentially expressed genes, with enrichment in neuromodulatory and metabolic pathways, including candidates linked to monoaminergic signaling and juvenile hormone biology, such as a takeout-like JH-binding gene.

We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

We uncover a dramatic shift in nucleoid organization - from an ultra-compact, transcriptionally restricted state in attack-phase cells to a progressively decompacted, ori-centered conformation during intracellular replication. Notably, distinct transcriptional and chromosome folding states not only mark the canonical attack and growth phases, but also critical transitions such as prey invasion, replication onset, and predator division. Temporal gene expression profiles reflect the coordinated regulation of core cellular functions across the predatory cycle. Furthermore, spatial localization of RNA polymerase, ribosomes, DNA-binding proteins, and freely diffusing proteins highlight the tight, cell cycle-dependent coupling between nucleoid compaction, chromosome accessibility, and transcriptional activity. Altogether, our findings reveal the intricate dynamics and coordination of genome folding and gene expression in a complex bacterial cell cycle driven by prey-predator interactions.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PREDATOR STG #802331;VAMPIRE COG #101171143;""},{""name"":""F.R.S.-FNRS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Crédit de Recherche &#34;PREDATOR NUCLEOID&#34;;""},{""name"":""Conseil Interuniversitaire de la Communauté Française de Belgique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Actions de Recherche Concertées &#34;PACHIDERM&#34;;""},{""name"":""WEL Research Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""WELBIO Starting Grant &#34;ARSENAL&#34;;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-23-CHBS-0002;""},{""name"":""France Génomique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-INBS-09;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Institute Strategic Program Harnessing Biosynthesis for Sustainable Food and Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01097X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

By retracing the evolution of Rubisco-chaperone interactions, we find that Rubiscos dependence on chaperones evolved neutrally and not by adaptive optimization, and that this may be reversed without compromising catalytic function.

Using the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we describe wall teichoic acid (WTA) as a critical mediator of DNA release from bacterial cells during infection. Mechanistically, we found that the -glycosylated form of WTA, generated by the enzyme TarM, is the primary mediator of bacterial DNA release within macrophages. This process is antagonized by the enzyme O-acetyltransferase, which prevents WTA attachment to peptidoglycan. This competition among peptidoglycan modifying enzymes determines activation of cytosolic DNA receptors AIM2 and cGAS. WTA therefore operates as a meta-regulator of inflammation, by controlling the availability of microbial ligands that stimulate innate immunity.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AI167993;R37AI116550;T32AI7061;K08AI193234;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-123-24;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DK34854;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550937

We evaluated the accuracy, including plasmid reconstruction, of Nanopore long-read only genome assemblies of Enterobacterales.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated.

Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the  ground truth was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics. Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations.

Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.

Impact StatementNanopore long-reads have historically been too error-prone to use alone for accurate bacterial genome assembly, necessitating additional Illumina short-reads to achieve structurally complete and accurate  hybrid genome assemblies for public health surveillance. This increases cost and complexity. Previous studies have shown that recent improvements in Nanopore chemistry (R10.4.1 flowcell) and basecalling (super-high accuracy) allow high-quality long-read only assemblies on a small number of laboratory reference strains. This is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, to assess Nanopore long-read only genome assembly compared with hybrid assembly on a large number of clinical isolates. In addition, this is the first large-scale evaluation of the recently released automated consensus long-read assembly tool, Autocycler.

We show that Autocycler long-read only assemblies are more structurally complete for chromosomal sequences, while reconstructing a similar number of plasmids to other long-read and hybrid assemblers. Most long-read polished, Autocycler-assembled genome sequences have 0 errors (median: 0 SNPs/indels) relative to a short-read polished (hybrid) Autocycler assemblies, enabling accurate annotation of key genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

This necessitates continuous RBC production, resulting in [~]200 billion new RBCs made per day to maintain oxygen delivery. Despite this enormous biosynthetic demand, the metabolic pathways supporting erythropoiesis are poorly understood. We profiled metabolites across four independent models of elevated erythropoiesis and a consistent increase in aspartate levels emerged when compared to controls. This suggested a potential role for aspartate metabolism in RBC production. To test this, we deleted the aspartate aminotransferases Got1 or Got2 globally or in an erythroid-specific manner. Loss of either enzyme resulted in anemia, with Got2 deficiency producing a more severe phenotype. Individual loss of either Got or dual Got deletion led to an erythroid defect, where early progenitors accumulated. In human and mouse models of erythropoiesis, GOT1 and GOT2 loss had opposing impacts on aspartate despite exhibiting similar anemic phenotypes, suggesting an aspartate-independent function for these enzymes. GOT1 and GOT2 are also components of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which regulates NAD(H) homeostasis. However, conditional deletion of another MAS enzyme, Mdh1, did not cause anemia, and alleviating NADH reductive stress in GOT2-deficient cells with cytoplasmic bacterial NADH oxidase (LbNOX) failed to restore erythropoiesis. Instead, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed dysregulation of chromatin histone modifications in GOT-deficient erythroid cells, implicating epigenetic dysfunction as a driver of defective erythropoiesis. Collectively, these findings identify a previously unrecognized role for GOT1 and GOT2 as a central link between metabolism and epigenetic regulation during erythroid development. These insights may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for anemia.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37 CA015910;RO1 CA025560;R01 CA001120;R01 CA148828;R01 CA245546;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 DK095201;U2C DK129445;""},{""name"":""National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Division of Intramural Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/023ny1p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 HL148333;R01 HL157062;F31 HL172674-02.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

We uncover distinct concentration-dependent binding behaviors for each TF. NANOG occupancy increased monotonously with its concentration, even though a common set of regions made accessible by OCT4 and SOX2 are highly and uniformly bound at all NANOG concentrations. In contrast, SOX2 occupancy does not increase with its concentrations, while OCT4 displayed an intermediate behavior. Our results challenge the notion that TF binding follows simple mass-action dynamics and reveal a core set of pluripotency regions that are bound by all three TFs at all TF concentrations, revealing how pluripotency can be maintained despite marked fluctuations in core pluripotency TFs.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRSII5_189910;310030_212197;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

Whilst there are known K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin resistance determinants, there is a lack of systematic data on the effect of determinants, alone and in combination, and there are no publicly accessible tools for predicting resistance from whole genome sequence data.

METHODSThe KlebNET-GSP AMR Genotype-Phenotype Group aggregated a matched genotype-phenotype dataset of n=12,167 K. pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) isolates from 27 countries between 2001-2021. We developed a rules-based classifier to predict ciprofloxacin resistance by categorizing the number of quinolone resistance determining regions mutations in gyrA and parC, the number of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, and the presence/absence of aac(6')-Ib-cr (which can acetylate ciprofloxacin).

Predictive performance was assessed using the discovery dataset, for which we re-phenotyped discrepant isolates; and validated using externally contributed datasets (n=7,030 KpSC isolates).

RESULTSThe rules-based classifier predicted R vs S/I with categorical agreement, sensitivity, and specificity >96%, and major/very major error rates <4%. Performance was similar across diverse KpSC sources (human, animal, other), species, and intra-species lineages. External validation of the classifier yielded overall 93.12% categorical agreement [95% confidence interval (CI), 92.50-93.74%], 8.65% major errors [95% CI, 7.34-9.97%], and 6.20% very major errors [95% CI, 5.51-6.90%]. We implemented the classifier in Kleborate, a command-line tool that is integrated into the Pathogenwatch web platform. Using this to assess the global distribution of ciprofloxacin resistance determinants in KpSC genomes available in Pathogenwatch (n=31,319, from 109 countries between years 2000-2023), we observed a significant positive association between national quinolone consumption rates and predicted ciprofloxacin resistance (R2=0.20, p=0.004).

CONCLUSIONS

Ciprofloxacin resistance phenotypes can be reasonably predicted from genotypes, which is sufficient for informing surveillance. However, unexplained resistance remains and accuracy is insufficient for clinical applications. We demonstrate the value of aggregating genotype-phenotype data to explore resistance mechanisms and develop predictors, but highlight complexities in combining phenotype data from different assays and standards.","[{""name"":""Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV025280, INV077266;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""226432/Z/22/Z;""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773830;""},{""name"":""Trond Mohn Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TMF2019TMT03;""},{""name"":""SARA project (Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Africa, through a grant from the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs within the Fonds de solidarité pour les projets innovants (FSPI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Academy of Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00c489v88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Health Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UK Vietnam MRC Newton Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/N029399/1 RG83380;""},{""name"":""National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

In the brain parenchyma, it is executed by microglia, which are encumbered by large numbers of apoptotic debris generated during development, in adult neurogenic niches, aging, and brain diseases. Emerging evidence suggest that phagocytosis is not limited to garbage disposal, but triggers adaptations in the phagocytes that may have a functional impact. To test it we developed an in vivo model of superphagocytosis induced by low cranial irradiation (LCI, 2Gy) that specifically induced apoptosis in the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus, synchronizing microglia in a phagocytic state within 6h and leading to full clearance by 24h. Single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics revealed an unexpected oxidative stress in post-phagocytic microglia, accompanied by catabolic shutdown, mitochondrial remodeling, increased expression of galectin 3, and production of polyamines that led to cell death and compensatory proliferation. To test whether these changes impaired subsequent microglial phagocytosis, we used a glioblastoma model treated with sequential irradiation to induce tumor cell apoptosis. The phagocytosis efficiency of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was comparable in the first and second apoptotic challenge, suggesting that the metabolic remodeling induced by phagocytosis was adaptive and destined to sustain their functionality. Finally, we assessed the functional impact of post-phagocytosis adaptations using galectin 3 deficient mice under LCI. We found that the recovery of the neurogenic niche after LCI strongly depended on galectin 3, demonstrating the regenerative capacity of post-phagocytic microglia. Overall, our data unveils the complexity of post-phagocytosis adaptations in microglia, underscoring their unexplored therapeutic potential in brain disorders.","[{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Competitiveness"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RTI2018-099267-B-I00;PID2022-136698OB-I00;RYC-2013-12817;""},{""name"":""Basque Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00pz2fp31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IT1473-22;PIBA 2020_1_0030;""},{""name"":""Tatiana Foundation Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P-048-FTPGB 2018;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AARG-NTF-24-1304352;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

However, integration of environmental cues to genetic regulators for controlling tiller outgrowth remains poorly understood. We investigated the effects of nitrogen, one of the critical environmental factors, on the early stages of tiller bud outgrowth. Comprehensive temporal transcriptomic analyses in response to two nitrogen forms, nitrate (NO -) and ammonium (NH +), identified gene-regulatory networks for nitrogen-triggered tiller outgrowth, with phytohormone signaling as the central interface. Pharmacological, molecular, and genetic experiments established cytokinin-auxin antagonism as a central regulator of the nitrogen-mediated tillering. Cytokinin promoted bud outgrowth by repressing the TCP transcription factor OsTB1, the key inhibitor of tillering, via Cytokinin Response Factors OsERF53/54. OsERF53/54 further reduced polar auxin transport by repressing OsPIN1a to promote bud activation. Conversely, auxin promoted bud dormancy by inducing OsTB1 and OsPIN1a via OsARF11/16. Both NO - and NH + triggered tiller outgrowth and induced largely overlapping transcriptional responses, with a temporal delay for NO -. Adequate nitrogen supplies induced cytokinin signaling while inhibiting auxin signaling and transport in tiller buds, thereby triggering bud outgrowth. Together, we identify a key regulatory role of auxin-cytokinin antagonistic module for integrating nitrogen signals to determine tiller bud fate.","[{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BT/Ag/Network/Rice/2019–20;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions.

Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction.

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

Yet these transitions also involve coordinated shifts in cell morphology and behaviour, which remain poorly characterized in densely packed epithelia. We developed a quantitative live-imaging and computational framework to track thousands of individual cells over time in the rapidly differentiating Xenopus mucociliary epithelium (MCE). From segmentations and trajectories, we extracted dynamic features-cell and nuclear shape, movement, position-to create a time-resolved morphodynamic dataset spanning the full course of differentiation. While single features showed high noise and low separability of ground-truth cell types, supervised machine learning revealed that integrating time-resolved features robustly predicts final cell fate. Gradient-boosted trees and multinomial logistic regression achieved moderate but consistent accuracy, especially for abundant epithelial lineages. Key discriminants included normalized Z-position, membrane-nucleus offset, and absolute experimental time, whereas movement contributed minimally to the results. Our results show that morphodynamic signatures encode predictive information about cell identity and provide a framework linking physical dynamics with molecular state.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21CC0073729;NNF19SA0035442;NNF22OC0076414;NNF19OC0056962;""},{""name"":""European Research Council CoG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101125803 MechanoFate;""},{""name"":""LEO Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02rgsr590"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LF-OC-19-000219;""},{""name"":""GENCI-IDRIS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A0161013396;AD011013695;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

Both lineages employ pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), yet plant mechanisms for sensing Gram-positive bacterial MAMPs remain poorly understood. Wall teichoic acids (WTAs), anionic glycopolymers unique to Gram-positive bacteria, are shown here to activate salicylic acid signaling, defense priming, and a non-canonical programmed cell death in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that glycosylated WTAs from diverse Gram-positive species elicit these responses and provide genetic evidence that their recognition depends on two members of the plant-specific CYSTEINE-RICH RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (CRK) gene family, which is absent in animals and whose function remains elusive. These findings reveal WTAs as a novel class of MAMPs in plants and highlight CRKs as key components in their perception.","[{""name"":""DFG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RI 2920/3-1;GRK 2172;INST 186/1277-1 FUGG;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

LP.8.1 was designated a Variant Under Monitoring by the WHO in January 2025 due to its potential to displace prior circulating variants. Informed by early growth modeling and antigenic analysis, we selected LP.8.1 as a candidate strain for the 2025-2026 vaccine season. Here, we describe the development of updated LP.8.1-matched mRNA vaccine compositions encoding either the full-length spike protein for mRNA-1273 (monovalent) or the membrane-anchored receptor-binding and N-terminal domains for the mRNA-1283 vaccine. Initial in vitro characterization, including structural analysis, demonstrated robust antigen expression and intact antigenic features. Immunogenicity of both vaccines were evaluated in murine models following immunization as either a primary series in naive animals or as a booster dose. LP.8.1-matched vaccines elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against the homologous LP.8.1 strain and more recently emerging JN.1-lineage subvariants, including XFG and NB.1.8.1. Notably, the mRNA-1283 vaccine expressing LP.8.1 induced higher mean neutralization titers than the mRNA-1273 version across multiple variants. These data demonstrate the immunogenicity and breadth of both LP.8.1-based mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1283 vaccines in the context of ongoing JN.1 lineage evolution and support the selection of LP.8.1 as the updated vaccine antigen for the 2025-2026 season.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938

We developed highly efficient, in vivo RNA electroporation-based single-cell gene editing to investigate neuronal responses to loss of fast inhibition. Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network. Our RNA-based single-cell gene editing approach enables investigation of cellular responses independent of network effects, providing new insights into neuronal homeostasis and gene function in individual cells in vivo.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759356550938
