To date, the cnidarian Turritopsis dohrnii is the only known species capable of undergoing reverse development after the onset of sexual reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Such studies face the central difficulty of distinguishing possible causal influences, in particular genetic and non-genetic ones. When confounding between possible influences is not rigorously addressed, it invites over- and misinterpretation of data. We illustrate the breadth of this problem through a discussion of the literature and a reanalysis of two examples. Clark (2023) suggested that patterns of similarity in social status between relatives indicate that social status is largely determined by one's DNA. We show that the paper's conclusions are based on the conflation of genetic and non-genetic transmission, such as wealth, within families. Song & Zhang (2024) posited that genetic variants underlying bisexual behavior are maintained in the population because they also affect risk-taking behavior, thereby conferring an evolutionary fitness advantage through increased sexual promiscuity. In this case, too, we show that possible explanations cannot be distinguished, but only one is chosen and presented as a conclusion. We discuss how issues of confounding apply more broadly to studies that claim to establish genetic underpinnings to human behavior and societal outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

These compounds have applications in medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. Their production is encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), groups of genes collectively directing their biosynthesis. The advent of metagenomics has allowed researchers to study BGCs directly from environmental samples, identifying numerous previously unknown BGCs encoding unprecedented chemistry. Here, we present the BGC Atlas (bgc-atlas.cs.uni-tuebingen.de), a web resource that facilitates the exploration and analysis of BGC diversity in metagenomes. The BGC Atlas identifies and clusters BGCs from publicly available datasets, offering a centralized database and a web interface for metadata-aware exploration of BGCs and gene cluster families (GCFs). We analyzed over 35,000 datasets from MGnify, identifying nearly 1.8 million BGCs, which were clustered into GCFs. The analysis showed that ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are the most abundant compound class, with most GCFs exhibiting high environmental specificity. We believe that our tool will enable researchers to easily explore and analyze the BGC diversity in environmental samples, significantly enhancing our understanding of bacterial secondary metabolites, and promote the identification of ecological and evolutionary factors shaping the biosynthetic potential of microbial communities.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Long-read sequencing (LRS) could help bridge this diagnostic gap by capturing variants inaccessible to SRS, facilitating long-range mapping and phasing, and providing haplotype-resolved methylation profiling. To evaluate LRS's additional diagnostic yield, we sequenced a rare disease cohort of 98 samples, including 41 probands and some family members, using nanopore sequencing, achieving per sample ~36x average coverage and 32 kilobase (kb) read N50 from a single flow cell. Our Napu pipeline generated assemblies, phased variants, and methylation calls. LRS covered, on average, coding exons in ~280 genes and ~5 known Mendelian disease genes that were not covered by SRS. In comparison to SRS, LRS detected additional rare, functionally annotated variants, including SVs and tandem repeats, and completely phased 87% of protein-coding genes. LRS detected additional de novo variants, and could be used to distinguish postzygotic mosaic variants from prezygotic de novos. Eleven probands were solved, with diverse underlying genetic causes including de novo and compound heterozygous variants, large-scale SVs, and epigenetic modifications. Our study demonstrates LRS's potential to enhance diagnostic yield for rare monogenic diseases, implying utility in future clinical genomics workflows.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137264

What factors determine whether a precursor cell differentiates or retains the capacity to divide? Here, we leverage the developmental flexibility of the stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) in Arabidopsis leaves as a model for how flexible decisions are regulated. Using a quantitative approach that combines long-term live imaging and statistical modeling, we discover that cell size is a strong predictor of SLGC behaviour: larger SLGCs divide less often than smaller cells. We propose that cell size is linked to division behaviour at multiple spatial scales. At the neighbourhood scale, cell size correlates with the strength of cell-cell signaling, which affects the rate at which SPEECHLESS (SPCH), a division-promoting transcription factor, is degraded. At the subcellular scale, cell size correlates with nuclear size, which modulates the concentration of SPCH in the nucleus. Our work shows how initial differences in SPCH levels are canalized by nuclear size and cell-cell signaling to inform the behaviour of a flexible cell type.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Materials and methodsA compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model was adapted to reflect COVID-19 cases in the UK. Numbers of symptomatic infections, COVID-19- related hospitalizations and deaths, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were predicted using a decision tree. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of an updated Moderna mRNA vaccine (Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign) was compared to no Autumn 2024 vaccine and to an updated Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA Autumn 2024 vaccine, from a healthcare perspective.

ResultsThe Moderna Autumn 2024 Vaccination Campaign is predicted to decrease the expected 8.3 million symptomatic infections with no vaccination by 19% to 6.7 million. Hospitalizations, long COVID cases, and deaths are expected to decline by 27,000 (-38%), 59,000 (-19%), and 6000 (-43%), respectively. The Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign will increase QALYs by 78,000 and costs by {pound}665 million, yielding an ICER of {pound}8500/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses suggest that vaccine effectiveness (VE) and waning, symptomatic infection incidence, hospitalization rates, and mortality rates drive cost-effectiveness. Vaccination remains cost-effective when lowering the target population to [&ge;]50 years. Use of the Moderna vaccine is expected to prevent 8000 more hospitalizations and 1700 more deaths than the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

ConclusionsVaccination of the eligible population would contribute to significant reductions in hospitalizations, deaths, and long COVID in the UK in the 2024-2025 season. Expanding the target population continues to be cost-effective. Use of the Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign is predicted to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated outcomes in a cost-effective manner and will contribute to a more resilient healthcare system in the UK.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137264

Epigenetic clocks measure aging but require DNA methylation data, which many studies lack. Using data from the Dunedin Study, we introduce an accurate and reliable measure for the rate of longitudinal aging derived from cross-sectional brain MRI: the Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from NeuroImaging or DunedinPACNI. Exporting this measure to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and UK Biobank neuroimaging datasets revealed that faster DunedinPACNI predicted participants' cognitive impairment, accelerated brain atrophy, and conversion to diagnosed dementia. Underscoring close links between longitudinal aging of the body and brain, faster DunedinPACNI also predicted physical frailty, poor health, future chronic diseases, and mortality in older adults. Furthermore, DunedinPACNI followed the expected socioeconomic health gradient. When compared to brain age gap, an existing MRI aging biomarker, DunedinPACNI was similarly or more strongly related to clinical outcomes. DunedinPACNI is a 'next generation' MRI measure that will be made publicly available to the research community to help accelerate aging research and evaluate the effectiveness of dementia prevention and anti-aging strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neurons anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Immediately, it has potential as a strategy for in-vivo electrode localization.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a spatial-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Glyoxylate, a key metabolite in (synthetic) CO2 fixation and carbon-conserving pathways, served as the test molecule. Through iterative screening of a compact metabolic model, we identified non-trivial growth-coupled designs that resulted in six metabolic sensors with a wide sensitivity range for glyoxylate, spanning three orders of magnitude in detected concentrations. We further adapted these E. coli strains for sensing glycolate and demonstrated their utility in both pathway engineering (testing a key metabolic module via glyoxylate) and applications in environmental monitoring (quantifying glycolate produced by photosynthetic microalgae).

Here, we used 3D light-sheet imaging to analyze the location and Ca2+ activity of single lower case Greek beta-cells within the entire islet at >2 Hz. Network analysis indicates that the most highly synchronized lower case Greek beta-cells are located at the islet center and remain geographically stable between oscillations. In contrast, lower case Greek beta-cells that initiate the Ca2+ wave ('leaders') are located at the islet periphery and change their identity over time via rotations in the wave axis. Activators of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase were used to further test the influence of glycolysis on these lower case Greek beta-cell subpopulations. Glucokinase activation, which increased oscillation period, reinforced leader cells and stabilized the wave axis. Pyruvate kinase activation, despite increasing oscillation frequency, had no effect on leader cells, indicating the wave origin is patterned by fuel input. The 3D islet lower case Greek beta-cell network, which did not respond to either treatment, is insensitive to changes in fuel metabolism. These findings emphasize the stochastic nature of Ca2+ oscillations and identify a role for glucokinase in spatially patterning 'leader' lower case Greek beta-cells.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Using standard [11C]raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) displacement methods used to measure brain dopamine responses to addictive drugs, we measured postingestive striatal dopamine responses to an ultra-processed milkshake high in fat and sugar in 50 young, healthy adults over a wide body mass index range (BMI 20-45 kg/m2). Surprisingly, milkshake consumption did not result in significant postingestive dopamine response in the striatum (p=0.62) nor any striatal subregion (p>0.33) and the highly variable interindividual responses were not significantly related to adiposity (BMI: r=0.076, p=0.51; %body fat: r=0.16, p=0.28). Thus, postingestive striatal dopamine responses to an ultra-processed milkshake were likely substantially smaller than many addictive drugs and below the limits of detection using standard PET methods.

The delivery of conventional IgG antibody technologies targeting GD2 is limited clinically by its co-expression on nerves that contributes to toxicity presenting as severe neuropathic pain. To improve the tumor selectivity of current GD2-targeting approaches, a next-generation bispecific antibody targeting GD2 and B7-H3 (CD276) was generated.

MethodsDifferential expression of human B7-H3 (hB7-H3) was transduced into GD2+ B78 murine melanoma cells and confirmed by flow cytometry. We assessed the avidity and selectivity of our GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific antibodies (INV34-6, INV33-2, and INV36-6) towards GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 cells relative to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells using flow cytometry and competition binding assays, comparing results an anti-GD2 antibody (dinutuximab, DINU). The bispecific antibodies, DINU, and a non-targeted bispecific control (bsAb CTRL) were conjugated with deferoxamine for radiolabeling with Zr-89 (t1/2 = 78.4 h). Using positron emission tomography (PET) studies, we evaluated the in vivo avidity and selectivity of the GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific compared to bsAb CTRL and DINU using GD2+/hB7-H3+ and GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 tumor models.

ResultsFlow cytometry and competition binding assays showed that INV34-6 bound with high avidity to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells with high avidity but not GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells. In comparison, no selectivity between cell types was observed for DINU. PET in mice bearing the GD2+/hB7-H3- and GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 murine tumor showed similar biodistribution in normal tissues for [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6, [89Zr]Zr-Df-bsAb CTRL, and [89Zr]Zr-Df-DINU. Importantly, [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6 tumor uptake was selective to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 over GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 tumors, and substantially higher to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 than the non-targeted [89Zr]Zr-Df-bsAb CTRL control. [89Zr]Zr-Df-DINU displayed similar uptake in both GD2+ tumor models, with uptake comparable to [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6 in the GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 model.

ConclusionThe GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific antibodies successfully improved selectivity to cells expressing both antigens. This approach should address the severe toxicities associated with GD2-targeting therapies by reducing off-tumor GD2 binding in nerves. Continued improvements in bispecific antibody technologies will continue to transform the therapeutic biologics landscape.

We performed a 48-week double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled decentralized study (Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity [PEARL]; NCT04488601; registration date 2020-07-28) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rapamycin in mitigating clinical signs of aging in a normative aging cohort. Participants received 5 or 10 mg / week of compounded rapamycin, or placebo for 48 weeks. Safety, adverse events (AEs) and blood biomarkers were collected. Efficacy was assessed using DEXA scan-based measures and standardized surveys assessing quality of life (QoL) and frailty. We did not detect significant differences in safety blood biomarkers, or moderate to severe AEs between the rapamycin treatment groups and placebo after 48 weeks. We detected dose-dependent (10 mg group) and sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass, pain, social functioning, overall QoL, and overall osteoarthritis score in females, and in bone mineral content in men. Additionally, some individuals receiving rapamycin experienced significant improvements in body composition metrics that were associated with beneficial changes in gut health and lipid metabolism. We conclude that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin administration over the course of 48 weeks is safe and induces sex-specific improvements in multiple aspects of healthspan, with the most robust improvements in lean tissue mass in women taking 10 mg rapamycin/week. Future work will aim to identify biometric signatures of clinical effectiveness to inform personalized treatment strategies that more broadly maximize efficacy and minimize side effects.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137264

By employing a 500-nm silica/gold Janus NP, we exploit its asymmetric optical contrast -- silica core with a gold cap on one hemisphere -- to achieve precise imaging of the unidirectional counter-clockwise rotation of single V-ATPase motors immobilized on surfaces. Despite the added viscous load from the relatively large Janus NP probe, our approach provides accurate torque measurements of single V-ATPase. This study underscores the advantages of Janus NPs over conventional probes, establishing them as powerful tools for single-molecule analysis of rotary molecular motors.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Yet, the mechanism of neurodegeneration in MPS VII remains elusive thereby limiting the scope of targeted intervention. To address this, we recently developed a {beta}-glucuronidase-deficient (CG2135-/-) Drosophila model of MPS VII. The CG2135-/- flies exhibited signs of neuromuscular degeneration, including loss of dopaminergic neurons, and accumulated engorged lysosomes, ubiquitinated proteins and mitochondria in their brains. These observations, coupled with our current finding that the CG2135-/- flies were highly susceptible to starvation, prompted us to investigate potential defects in the autophagy-lysosomal clearance machinery in the fly brain. We found that both autophagy induction and lysosome-mediated autophagosomal turnover were impaired in the CG2135-/- fly brain. This was evidenced by lower Atg8a-II levels, reduced Atg1 and Ref(2)P expression along with accumulation of lipofuscin-like inclusions and multilamellar bodies. Interestingly, mitophagy was also found to be defective in their brain, causing buildup of enlarged mitochondria with distorted cristae and reduced membrane potential. This, in turn, affected mitochondrial function as reflected by drastically reduced brain ATP levels. Energy depletion triggered apoptosis in neuronal as well as non-neuronal cells of the CG2135-/- fly brain, where we also detected TUNEL-positive dopaminergic neurons. Resveratrol treatment, previously found to protect against loss of dopaminergic neurons in the CG2135-/- flies, has now been shown act by correcting the mitophagy defect and preventing ATP depletion. Collectively, our study establishes a causal link between mitophagy defect, mitochondrial malfunction, and neurodegeneration in MPS VII.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Our study aims to quantify the impact of vaccination programmes during this initial year of vaccination by estimating the number of case fatalities avoided, having Sweden as a case study. Using Swedish data on age-specific reported incidence, vaccination uptake, and contact structures, along with age-specific estimates on the vaccine efficacies and under-reporting from the literature, we fit a Bayesian SEIR epidemic model with time-varying community contact rate {beta}(t) for COVID-19 incidence. By adding age-specific infection fatality rates, we obtain an estimate of about 5,540 (95% PI: 5,390-5,690) for the number of case fatalities from the fitted model. This estimate aligns closely with the reported 5,430 case fatalities during the same period. We then use the estimated contact rate {beta}(t) in a counterfactual analysis where the population is unvaccinated, leading to more infections and fatalities. The counterfactual analysis result in a severe epidemic outbreak during the early autumn of 2021, resulting in about 52,600 (49,900-55,500) number of case fatalities. Consequently, the number of lives saved by the vaccination program is estimated to be about 47,100 (44,500-49,800), out of which 6,460 are directly saved and 40,600 are indirectly saved, mainly by drastically reducing the severe outbreak in the early autumn of 2021, which would have occurred without vaccination and unchanged community contact rate. Our mathematical model is used to analyze the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on lives saved in Sweden during 2021, but the same methodology can be applied to other countries. The counterfactual analysis offers insights into an alternative trajectory of the pandemic without vaccination. By incorporating estimated vaccination-related parameters, age-specific infection fatality ratio and under-reporting, our model estimates the number of case fatalities avoided. The results not only show the direct impact of vaccination on reducing deaths for infected individuals but also shed light on the indirect effects of reduced transmission dynamics.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137264

By strategically bringing outlier cell candidates near the decision boundary up for annotation, ActSort reduces human labor to about 1-3% of cell candidates and improves curation accuracy by mitigating annotator bias. To facilitate the algorithm's widespread adoption among experimental neuroscientists, we created a user-friendly software and conducted a first-of-its-kind benchmarking study involving about 160,000 annotations.

Whether growth conditions affect other stages of replication beyond initiation, remains to be systematically studied. To address this, we assess the replication dynamics of Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium that undergoes only single round of replication per cell cycle, by tracking the replisome across various growth phases and nutrient conditions. We find that the replication elongation rates slowdown as cells transition from exponential (high-nutrient) to stationary (low-nutrient) phase, and this contributes significantly to the overall cell cycle delay. While elongation rates are correlated with growth rates, both properties appear to be differentially influenced by nutrient status. This slowdown in replication progression is not associated with increased mutagenesis or upregulation of the DNA damage responses. We conclude that the growth conditions not only dictate the commitment to replication but also the rates of genome duplication. Such regulation appears to be distinct from stress-induced replication slowdown and likely serves as an adaptive mechanism to cope with fluctuations in nutrient availability in the environment.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

The human FEAR pathway is mediated by the FACT complex, consisting of hSpt16 and SSRP1 subunits, that remodels chromatin to activate expression of the antiviral transcription factor, ETS-1. To counter this pathway, poxvirus A51R proteins tether SUMOylated hSpt16 subunits to microtubules to prevent ETS-1 expression. While these observations indicate a role for the FEAR pathway in DNA virus restriction, it was unclear if RNA viruses interact with this pathway. Here, we show that RNA viruses are also restricted by the FEAR pathway, yet encode mechanisms distinct from poxviruses to counter this response. We show vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus, utilizes its matrix (M) protein to promote proteasome-dependent degradation of SUMOylated hSpt16 and to block ETS-1 nuclear import. Strains encoding mutant M proteins that cannot antagonize the FEAR pathway exhibit replication defects in human cells that can be rescued by hSpt16 or ETS-1 depletion. Moreover, FACT inhibitor treatment enhanced the replication of oncolytic VSV strains encoding defective M proteins in restrictive cancer cells, suggesting FEAR pathway inhibition may improve oncolytic virotherapy. Strikingly, we provide evidence that the inability of VSV M to degrade SUMOylated Spt16 in lepidopteran insect cells results in abortive infection, suggesting VSV-Spt16 interactions influence virus host range. Lastly, we show that human and murine paramyxovirus target SUMOylated Spt16 proteins for degradation in human and murine cells utilizing a conserved N-terminal motif in their accessory ""C"" proteins. Collectively, our study illustrates that DNA and RNA viruses have independently evolved diverse mechanisms to antagonize SUMOylated host Spt16 proteins, underscoring the physiological importance of the FEAR pathway to antiviral immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Many flagellated species move on agar using a form of collective motility termed swarming. Swarming has been thought to require flagellar propulsion. Here, we report the rapid migration of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica on agar surfaces in the absence of active propulsion by flagella. While immotile in liquid, filament-less and rotation-defective mutants of Salmonella LT2 and E. coli migrate on surfaces at rates comparable to wild-type. In contrast to the ""sliding"" motility reported in many species, the surface migration here does not require but is instead inhibited by surfactant. It is thus a novel form of surface movement that we call ""surfing."" Surfing cells acidify the plates, and surfing is found to depend on the presence of fermentable sugar. We propose a model in which fermentation at the colony front produces osmolytes that draw water from the agar to generate a moving bulge at the margin of the expanding colony.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Countries that have had recent FMD outbreaks are prohibited from exporting most meat products; this has major economic consequences for farmers in those countries, particularly farmers that experience outbreaks or are near outbreaks. Reducing the number of FMD outbreaks in countries where the disease is endemic is an important challenge that could drastically improve the livelihoods of millions of people. As a result, significant effort is expended on surveillance; but there is a concern that uninformative surveillance strategies may waste resources that could be better used on control management. Rapid detection through sentinel surveillance may be a useful tool to reduce the scale and burden of outbreaks. In this study, we use an extensive outbreak and cattle shipment network dataset from the Republic of Turkiye to test three possible strategies for sentinel surveillance allocation that differ in their data requirements: ranging from low to high data needs, we allocate limited surveillance to [1] farms that frequently send and receive shipments of animals (Network Connectivity), [2] farms near other farms with past outbreaks (Spatial Proximity) and [3] farms that receive many animals from other farms with past outbreaks (Network Proximity). We determine that all of these surveillance methods find a similar number of outbreaks - 2-4.5 times more outbreaks than were detected by surveying farms at random. On average across surveillance efforts, the Network Proximity and Network Connectivity methods each find a similar number of outbreaks and the Spatial Proximity method always finds the fewest outbreaks. Since the Network Proximity method does not outperform the other methods, these results indicate that incorporating both cattle shipment data and outbreak data provides only marginal benefit over the less data-intensive surveillance allocation methods for this objective. We also find that these methods all find more outbreaks when outbreaks are rare. This is encouraging, as early detection is critical for outbreak management. Overall, since the Spatial Proximity and Network Connectivity methods find a similar proportion of outbreaks, and are less data-intensive than the Network Proximity method, countries with endemic FMD whose resources are constrained could prioritize allocating sentinels based on whichever of those two methods requires less additional data collection.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

This variability poses challenges for studying, predicting, and engineering microbiomes. Here we examined how Arabidopsis, Barley, and Lotus plants recruit specific bacteria from highly complex synthetic communities (SynComs) composed of hundreds of bacterial isolates originating from these plants when grown in natural soil. We discovered that, despite their taxonomic diversity, bacteria enriched by these three plant species encode largely overlapping functions. A set of 266 functions common among all host-associated communities was identified at the foundation of the microbiota's functional potential. Analysis of the differences observed between root-associated communities revealed that functions recruited by Arabidopsis and Barley were primarily driven by the SynCom composition, while Lotus selected fewer isolates but with more diverse functionalities, akin to a ""Swiss army knife"" strategy. We analysed the variation at the functional level and found this can be explained by the combined functions of bacteria at the family level. Additionally, across major taxa, the isolates covering a broader range of their family's functional diversity achieved higher relative abundance in the root communities. Our work sheds light on key functions and principles guiding the recruitment of bacterial isolates into root microbiota, offering valuable insights for microbiome engineering and inoculant discovery at a previously inaccessible taxonomic level.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Multiple p-tau biomarkers on several analytical platforms are poised for clinical use. The Alzheimers Association Global Biomarker Standardisation Consortium plasma phospho-tau Round Robin study engaged assay developers in a blinded case-control study on plasma p-tau, aiming to learn which assays provide the largest fold-changes in AD compared to non-AD, have the strongest relationship between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and show the most consistent relationships between methods (commutability) in measuring both patient samples and candidate reference materials (CRM). METHODS: Thirty-three different p-tau biomarker assays, built on eight different analytical platforms, were used to quantify paired plasma and CSF samples from 40 participants. AD biomarker status was categorised as AD pathology (n=25) and non-AD pathology (n=15) by CSF A{beta}42/A{beta}40 (US-FDA; CE-IVDR) and p-tau181 (CE-IVDR) methods. The commutability of four CRM, at three concentrations, was assessed across assays. FINDINGS: Plasma p-tau217 consistently demonstrated higher fold-changes between AD and non-AD pathology groups, compared to other p-tau epitopes. Fujirebio LUMIPULSE G, UGOT IPMS, and Lilly MSD p-tau217 assays provided the highest median fold-changes. In CSF, p-tau217 assays also performed best, and exhibited substantially larger fold-changes than their plasma counterparts, despite similar diagnostic performance. P-tau217 showed the strongest correlations between plasma assays (rho=0.81 to 0.97). Plasma p-tau levels were weakly-to-moderately correlated with CSF p-tau, and correlations were non-significant within the AD group alone. The evaluated CRM were not commutable across assays. INTERPRETATION: Plasma p-tau217 measures had larger fold-changes and discriminative accuracies for detecting AD pathology, and better agreement across platforms than other plasma p-tau variants. Plasma and CSF markers of p-tau, measured by immunoassays, are not substantially correlated, questioning the interchangeability of their continuous relationship. Further work is warranted to understand the pathophysiology underlying this dissociation, and to develop suitable reference materials facilitating cross-assay standardisation.

The Caribbean harbors a high number of threatened, endangered, and critically endangered coral species compared to reefs of the larger Indo-Pacific. The reef corals of the Caribbean are also long diverged from their Pacific counterparts and may have evolved different survival strategies. Most genomic resources have been developed for Pacific coral species which may impede our ability to study the changes in genetic composition of Caribbean reef communities in response to global change. To help fill the gap in genomic resources, we used PacBio HiFi sequencing to generate the first genome assemblies for three Caribbean, reef-building corals, Colpophyllia natans, Dendrogyra cylindrus, and Siderastrea siderea. We also explore the genomic novelties that shape scleractinian genomes. Notably, we find abundant gene duplications of all classes (e.g., tandem and segmental), especially in S. siderea. This species has one of the largest genomes of any scleractinian coral (822Mb) which seems to be driven by repetitive content and gene family expansion and diversification. As the genome size of S. siderea was double the size expected of stony corals, we also evaluated the possibility of an ancient whole genome duplication using Ks tests and found no evidence of such an event in the species. By presenting these genome assemblies, we hope to develop a better understanding of coral evolution as a whole and to enable researchers to further investigate the population genetics and diversity of these three species.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Parkinson's disease is associated with multiple nocturnal symptoms such as akinesia, insomnia and sleep fragmentation which may require adjustments of stimulation during sleep for best treatment outcome. Objectives: There is a need for a robust biomarker to guide stimulation titration across sleep stages. This study aimed to investigate whether evoked resonant neural activity (ERNA) is modulated during sleep. Methods: We recorded local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus of four Parkinson's patients with externalised electrodes while applying single stimulation pulses to investigate the effect of sleep on ERNA. Results: We found that ERNA features change with wakefulness and sleep stages, and are correlated with canonical frequency bands and heart rate. We further evaluated the performance of machine learning models in classifying non-REM sleep versus wakefulness and found that ERNA amplitude outperforms all spectral markers. Conclusions: Given the heterogeneity of spectral features during sleep, their susceptibility to movement artefacts and superior classification accuracy of models using ERNA features, this study paves the way for ERNA as a marker for automatic stimulation titration during sleep and improved patient care.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

We previously proposed that these NTD-targeting infection-enhancing antibodies (NIEAs) cross-link neighboring spike proteins via their NTDs, and that this results in a decoupling between the NTD and receptor binding domain (RBD), facilitating the ""RBD down"" to ""up"" transition.

The variable loops of the antibody complementarity-determining region (CDR) are particularly crucial for immune responses and therapeutic applications due to their effective target recognition capabilities. Accurate structure prediction of these antibody loops is essential for the efficient in silico design of target-binding antibodies for therapeutic or industrial use. However, predicting antibody loop structures is challenging due to the lack of evolutionary information from related proteins. Thus, a successful ab initio structure prediction method, which operates without structural templates or related sequences, is crucial for the effective design of antibody loop-mediated interactions. This study demonstrates that highly accurate antibody loop structure prediction enables the effective zero-shot design of target-binding antibody loops. The performance of loop design has been shown to depend on the accuracy of ab initio loop structure prediction, as tested with two versions of our design model. The high affinity, diversity, novelty, and specificity of the antibody loops designed with these new methods were validated experimentally on four target proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

For instance, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exhibited upregulated genes in signaling pathways involved in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, and downregulated pathways associated with aerobic metabolism. Using cell-cell communication analysis, we identified increased strength in predicted interactions within stroke tissue among both neural and non-neural cells via signaling pathways such as those involving collagen, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, neuronal growth regulator, laminin, and several cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between mouse transcriptome responses after stroke and those observed in human nonfatal brain stroke lesions.

Crucially, electron microscopy revealed widespread mitochondrial vacuolations and the presence of myofilament degradation within the cardiomyocytes of these patients. These findings were mirrored in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, suggesting a potential underlying cellular mechanism for the cardiac effects associated with Long COVID. Our report sheds light on the cardiovascular implications of Long COVID and underscores the importance of further research to understand its cellular underpinnings.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137264

Here, we show that maternal IgG, ingested in the first week of life, functions to restrain microbiota-dependent adaptive immune responses and reduce offspring susceptibility to intestinal inflammation weeks later, following weaning. To exert these functions, efficient binding of IgG to gut bacterial antigens and engagement of Fc and complement dependent effector functions in offspring was required. These discoveries reveal a novel mechanism wherein maternal IgG engages the offspring immune system to calibrate responses to gut microbes. This mode of maternal immune instruction may provide adaptability to developmental shifts in microbiota necessary for establishing host-microbiota mutualism and limiting susceptibility to inflammatory disease.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

Here, we aggregate structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 38,696 healthy controls (HC) and 1,256 psychosis-related conditions, including first-degree relatives of schizophrenia (SCZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SAD) patients (n = 160), individuals who had psychotic experiences (n = 157), patients who experienced a first episode of psychosis (FEP, n = 352), and individuals with chronic SCZ or SAD (n = 587). Using a normative modeling approach, we generated centile scores for cortical gray matter (GM) phenotypes, identifying deviations in regional volumes below the expected trajectory for all conditions, with a greater impact on the clinically diagnosed ones, FEP and chronic. Additionally, we mapped 46 neurobiological features from healthy individuals (including neurotransmitters, cell types, layer thickness, microstructure, cortical expansion, and metabolism) to these abnormal centiles using a multivariate approach. Results revealed that neurobiological features were highly co-localized with centile deviations, where metabolism (e.g., cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRGlu) and cerebral blood flow (CBF)) and neurotransmitter concentrations (e.g., serotonin (5-HT) and acetylcholine (4{beta}2) receptors) showed the most consistent spatial overlap with abnormal GM trajectories.

Genomic sequencing of influenza strains is important to understand the evolution of the influenza strains and also to select the appropriate influenza vaccines to be used in the different influenza seasons in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we sought to understand the molecular epidemiology of the influenza viruses in the Western Province of Sri Lanka, including mutational analysis to investigate the evolutionary dynamics. Methodology: A total of 349 individuals presenting with fever and respiratory symptoms were enrolled in this study from November 2022 to May 2024. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens were collected and screened using quantitative PCR to detect Influenza A, Influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2. Subtyping and genomic sequencing was carried out on influenza A strains using Oxford Nanopore Technology. Results: Influenza A was detected in 49 (14 %) patients, influenza B in 20 (5.7%) and SARS-CoV-2 in 41 (11.7%). Co-infections were observed in five participants. The phylogenetic analysis assigned the H1N1 HA gene sequences within the 6B.1A.5a.2a clade. The HA gene of the H1N1 sequences in 2023 were assigned as belonging to the subclades C.1, C.1.2, and C.1.8, while the 2024 sequences were assigned to subclades C.1.8 and C.1.9. The H3N2 sequences from 2023 were assigned to the 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.1b clade and subclade G.1.1.2, while the 2024 sequences were assigned to the 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.3a.1 clade and subclade J.2. The K54Q, A186T, Q189E, E224A, R259K, K308R, I418V, and X215A amino acid substitutions were seen in the H1N1 in the 2023 and 2024 sequences. The 2024 H1N1 sequences additionally exhibited further substitutions, such as V47I, I96T, T120A, A139D, G339X, K156X, and T278S. Conclusion: In this first study using genomic sequencing to characterize the influenza A strains in Sri Lanka, which showed different influenza A viruses circulating in an 18-month period. As the Sri Lankan strains also had certain mutations of unknown significance, it would be important to continue detailed surveillance of the influenza strains in Sri Lanka to choose the most suitable vaccines for the population and the timing of vaccine administration.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137264

While these pathologies have traditionally been associated with ATP deficits, mitochondrial dysfunction also leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, inflammation, and alterations the function of other organelles. While the negative impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on lysosomal activity has been established, the relationship between mitochondria and the rest of the endocytic compartment remains poorly understood. Here, we show that inhibiting mitochondrial activity through genetic and chemical approaches causes early endosome (EE) perinuclear aggregation and impairs cargo delivery to lysosomes. This impairment is due to altered microtubule architecture and centrosome dynamics, mediated by ROS. Antioxidants can rescue these EE defects, underlying the pivotal role of mitochondria in maintaining cellular activities through ROS regulation of microtubule networks. Our findings highlight the significance of mitochondria beyond ATP production, emphasizing their critical involvement in endocytic trafficking and cellular homeostasis. These insights emphasize mitochondria's critical involvement in cellular activities and suggest novel targets for therapies to mitigate the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137264

We prompted 4 LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Flash, Claude 3 Haiku, GPT-4o, Stanford Medicine Secure GPT (GPT-4.0)) with a set of 38 prompts consisting of explicit questions and synthetic clinical notes created by medically trained reviewers and LGBTQIA+ health experts. The prompts explored clinical situations across two axes: (i) situations where historical bias has been observed vs. not observed, and (ii) situations where LGBTQIA+ identity is relevant to clinical care vs. not relevant. Medically trained reviewers evaluated LLM responses for appropriateness (safety, privacy, hallucination/accuracy, and bias) and clinical utility. We find that all 4 LLMs evaluated generated inappropriate responses to our prompt set. LLM performance is strongly hampered by learned anti-LGBTQIA+ bias and over-reliance on the mentioned conditions in prompts. Given these results, future work should focus on tailoring output formats according to stated use cases, decreasing sycophancy and reliance on extraneous information in the prompt, and improving accuracy and decreasing bias for LGBTQIA+ patients and care providers.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137265

Here, we monitored auditory cortex activity during the local-global paradigm, a protocol nesting different regularity levels in sound sequences. We observed that mice encode local predictions based on stimulus occurrence and stimulus transition probabilities, because auditory responses are boosted upon prediction violation. This boosting was due to both short-term adaptation and an adaptation-independent surprise mechanism resisting anesthesia. In parallel, and only in wakefulness, VIP interneurons responded to the omission of the locally expected sound repeat at sequence ending, thus providing a chunking signal potentially useful for establishing global sequence structure. When this global structure was violated, by either shortening the sequence or ending it with a locally expected but globally unexpected sound transition, activity slightly increased in VIP and PV neurons respectively. Hence, distinct cellular mechanisms predict different regularity levels in sound sequences.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

Whereas projection neurons of the optic lobes responsive to looming stimuli have been well described, how this information is transmitted to the motor system to elicit a saccade, is not well understood. Here we describe activity of the descending neuron DNp03 in Drosophila, which receives direct input from looming-sensitive visual interneurons and projects to wing motor areas within the ventral nerve cord. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from this neuron during head-fixed flight confirm that DNp03 is responsive to looming stimuli on the side ipsilateral to its dendrites. In addition, activity of this neuron is state-dependent as looming stimuli only elicit spikes during flight and not rest. The behavior in response to the looming stimulus is variable, which allowed us to study how activity of DNp03 relates to the execution of a saccade. Our analysis revealed that sustained activity in DNp03, persisting even after the visual stimulus ended, was the strongest predictor of saccade execution, therefore reflecting the behavioral decision of the fly to respond to the stimulus.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

Despite its popularity, qpAdm remains untested on histories in the form of admixture graphs of random topology or stepping-stone landscapes. We analyzed data from such simulations and found that while for admixture-graph-shaped histories there exist simple solutions (temporal stratification) for minimizing false findings of gene flow, in the case of stepping-stone landscapes the method generates results that do not appear suspect but are misleading: feasible qpAdm models are either accurate but simplistic in the context of landscapes, or highly inaccurate in the case of multi-component models. This is largely is due to two reasons: 1) because of complex migration networks that violate the assumptions of the method, there is poor correlation between qpAdm p-values and model optimality in many sections of the parameter space; 2) admixture fraction estimates between 0 and 1 are largely restricted to symmetric source configurations around targets, hence popular [0, 1] model plausibility criteria confound analyses of landscape-type demographies, unless their interpretations are explicitly spatial. For many species/regions/periods archaeogenetic sampling is very sparse and may be random with respect to population density of ancient individuals. In this situation only a specific combination of landscape properties and feasibility criteria allows to efficiently reject highly asymmetric non-optimal models most abundant in random deme sets. This problem may obscure useful signal (rare optimal models) and might be responsible for some claims about rapid long-distance migrations in the literature.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

In this study, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, we conducted laboratory selection for over 60 generations under excessive BL exposure. The selected line (SL) flies exhibited enhanced BL-tolerance, and also increased body weight and lipid accumulation. Interestingly, we found elongated midgut in the SL flies, and increased microbiota, which was dominated by Acetobacter persici. The BL-tolerance and the lipid accumulation were dependent on the increment of gut microbiota. Genomic analysis identified mutations in the Hippo signaling pathway linked to midgut elongation, while transcriptome analysis showed downregulation of Tachykinin (Tk), a key suppressor of intestinal lipogenesis. Genetically induced lipid accumulation through manipulation of Tk or related lipogenic genes was sufficient to confer BL-tolerance. Moreover, our findings indicate that parental BL irradiation, along with accumulated mutations from laboratory selection, played a crucial role in midgut elongation and increased bacterial abundance. These findings reveal evolutionary responses to excessive BL exposure that shape host traits to maximize the benefits provided by gut microbiota.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

Previously, a small molecule, 1, was discovered that binds to r(CAG)exp and rescues aberrant pre-mRNA splicing in patient-derived fibroblasts by freeing proteins bound to the repeats. Here, we report the structures of single r(CAG) repeat motif (5'CAG/3'GAC where the underlined adenosines form a 1x1 nucleotide internal loop) in complex with 1 and two other small molecules via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with simulated annealing. Compound 2 was designed based on the structure of 1 bound to the RNA while 3 was selected as a diverse chemical scaffold. The three complexes, although adopting different 3D binding pockets upon ligand binding, are stabilized by a combination of stacking interactions with the internal loop's closing GC base pairs, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed with NMR-derived restraints show that the RNA is stretched and bent upon ligand binding with significant changes in propeller-twist and opening. Compound 3 has a distinct mode of binding by insertion into the helix, displacing one of loop nucleotides into the major groove and affording a rod-like shape binding pocket.

The biosynthetic and degradation pathways of Galf in pathogens have attracted attention as potential targets for drug development. beta-D-Galactofuranosidase (Galf-ase) releases Galf from the non-reducing ends of glycans. Galf-ase activity is often exhibited by alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases, which hydrolyze a similar substrate. Several Galf-specific Galf-ases that cleave only Galf and not L-arabinofuranose (Araf) have recently been identified in the glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 2, 5, and 43. However, the structural basis of how they discriminate the substrates is unknown. ORF1110, belonging to GH2, is the first identified Galf-specific Galf-ase isolated from Streptomyces sp. JHA19. Here, we solved the crystal structure of ORF1110 in complex with a mechanism-based potent inhibitor, D-iminogalactitol (Ki = 65 uM). ORF1110 binds to the C5-C6 hydroxy groups of D-iminogalactitol with an extensive and integral hydrogen bond network. This result suggests that in the case of Araf, which lacks the C6 hydroxymethyl group, this network is not formed. The domain structure of ORF1110 is similar to that of beta-glucuronidases and beta-galactosidases, which belong to the same GH2 family and hydrolyze pyranose substrates. However, their active site structures were completely different. A predicted structure of the C-terminal Abf domain of ORF1110 was very similar to the carbohydrate-binding module family 42, which binds Araf, and pockets that may bind Galf were present.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

Machine learning can expedite this discovery process. Although machine learning techniques for predicting general compound inhibition are available, we are not aware of any that accurately forecast the inhibitory effect of a compound on a specific protein complex, utilizing inputs from both the compound and the protein complex. We present the first targeted machine learning based predictor of small molecule based inhibition of protein complexes. Our proposed graph neural network integrates the structure of a protein complex, its binding site or interface features and a compound's SMILES representation to predict the potential of the given compound to inhibit the interaction between proteins in the given complex in a targeted manner. Validated on the 2p2i-DB-v2 database, encompassing 714 inhibitors across 23 complexes with over 12,000 instances, our model achieves superior predictive accuracy (crossvalidation AUC-ROC of 0.86), outperforming established kernel methods and pre-trained neural networks. We further tested the predictive performance of our model on two independent external datasets - one collected from recent publications and another consisting of putative inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2-Spike and Human-ACE2 protein complex with AUC-ROCs of 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. Our targeted predictor introduces a novel approach for PPI inhibitor discovery, laying foundational work for future advancements in addressing this complex and previously unexplored prediction challenge.

Thus far, only a limited number of Clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized, and they are not representative across different regions and time periods.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17/26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 423/603 (70.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to Clade I, among which 17 were Clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (95%) of the new strains fall within previously described Clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among Clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows multiple virus lineages being present within a large urban center.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic in DRC is predominated by zoonotic spillover events involving Clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the Clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137265

Here, we use the UK Biobank to measure the change in PGS prediction accuracy as a continuous function of individuals' genome-wide genetic dissimilarity to the GWAS sample (''genetic distance''). Our results highlight three gaps in our understanding of PGS portability. First, prediction accuracy is extremely noisy at the individual level and not well predicted by genetic distance. In fact, variance in prediction accuracy is explained comparably well by socioeconomic measures. Second, trends of portability vary across traits. For several immunity-related traits, prediction accuracy drops near zero quickly even at intermediate levels of genetic distance. This quick drop may reflect GWAS associations being more ancestry-specific in immunity-related traits than in other traits. Third, we show that even qualitative trends of portability can depend on the measure of prediction accuracy used. For instance, for white blood cell count, a measure of prediction accuracy at the individual level (reduction in mean squared error) increases with genetic distance. Together, our results show that portability cannot be understood through global ancestry groupings alone. There are other, understudied factors influencing portability, such as the specifics of the evolution of the trait and its genetic architecture, social context, and the construction of the polygenic score. Addressing these gaps can aid in the development and application of PGS and inform more equitable genomic research.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

Here, we show that stabilizing selection on quantitative traits--even around the same optimal trait values in the two populations and when the populations are demographically identical--generates selection against the minor-parent ancestry in a population formed via unequal admixture of the two populations. We calculate the rate at which minor-parent ancestry is purged under this mechanism, both in the early generations after admixture and in the long term, and we verify these calculations with whole-genome simulations. Because of its ubiquity, stabilizing selection offers a general mechanism for the deleterious effect of introgressed ancestry.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

Despite its importance, conducting manual experiments with individual fruit flies can be challenging and time-consuming, especially for studies of individual fly behaviors. Such studies often involve cumbersome preparatory steps, such as manually tethering a fly and then positioning it within an experimental setup1,2. These procedures commonly require the fly to be anesthetized, and, before behavioral assessments begin, the fly must recover from anesthesia. Hence, the introduction of automated phenotyping and behavioral assays would expedite important aspects of fly research, by minimizing manual handling of flies and decreasing the net time needed for experiments. Here, we introduce FlyMAX (Fly Manipulation and Autonomous eXperimentation), an autonomous robotic system for manipulating adult flies without use of anesthesia. FlyMAX collects individual flies from a standard vial, analyzes them with computer vision, and achieves a throughput of >1,000 flies per day for high-throughput inspection and characterization assays. Robotic handling had no detectable adverse effects on fly longevity or our assessments of fly health. Moreover, the behavioral performance of flies, especially of males, was better and less variable than of flies handled manually. Our system employs deep learning-based machine vision for real-time assessments of picking quality and fly phenotypes. This enables fully pipelined, autonomous experimentation for behavioral assays with individual flies in controlled environments, which was previously infeasible. Overall, FlyMAX constitutes a promising technology to enhance the efficiency and reproducibility of research with flies and other insects in fields such as genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

Anti-defense proteins have diverse functional domains, sequences, and are typically small, creating a challenge to detect anti-defense homologs across the prokaryotic genomes. To date, no tools comprehensively annotate anti-defense proteins within a desired genome or MGE. Here, we developed ""AntiDefenseFinder"" - a free open-source tool and web service that detects 156 anti-defense systems (of one or more proteins) in any genomic sequence. Using this dataset, we identified 47,981 anti-defense systems distributed across prokaryotes, phage, and MGEs. We found that some genes co-localize in ""anti-defense islands"", including E. coli T4 and Lambda phages, although many are standalone. Out of the 112 systems detected in bacteria, 100 systems localize only or preferentially in prophages, plasmids, phage satellites, integrons, and integrative and conjugative elements. However, over 80% of anti-Pycsar protein 1 (Apyc1) resides in non-mobile regions of bacteria. Evolutionary and functional analyses revealed that Apyc1 likely originated in bacteria to regulate cNMP signaling, but was co-opted multiple times by phages to overcome cNMP-utilizing defenses. With the AntiDefenseFinder tool, we hope to facilitate the identification of the full repertoire of anti-defense systems in MGEs, the discovery of new protein functions, and a deeper understanding of host-pathogen arms race.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

Key to this are activation domains, which often fall within disordered regions of transcription factors3,4 and recruit co-activators to initiate transcription5. These interactions are difficult to characterize via most experimental techniques because they are typically weak and transient6,7. Consequently, we know very little about whether these interactions are promiscuous or specific, the mechanisms of binding, and how these interactions tune the strength of gene activation. To address these questions, we developed a microfluidic platform for expression and purification of hundreds of activation domains in parallel followed by direct measurement of co-activator binding affinities (STAMMPPING, for Simultaneous Trapping of Affinity Measurements via a Microfluidic Protein-Protein INteraction Generator). By applying STAMMPPING to quantify direct interactions between eight co-activators and 204 human activation domains (>1,500 Kds), we provide the first quantitative map of these interactions and reveal 334 novel binding pairs. We find that the metazoan-specific co-activator P300 directly binds >100 activation domains, potentially explaining its widespread recruitment across the genome to influence transcriptional activation. Despite sharing similar molecular properties (e.g. enrichment of negative and hydrophobic residues), activation domains utilize distinct biophysical properties to recruit certain co-activator domains. Co-activator domain affinity and occupancy are well-predicted by analytical models that account for multivalency, and in vitro affinities quantitatively predict activation in cells with an ultrasensitive response. Not only do our results demonstrate the ability to measure affinities between even weak protein-protein interactions in high throughput, but they also provide a necessary resource of over 1,500 activation domain/co-activator affinities which lays the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of transcriptional activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

This is variously interpreted as speed/accuracy, fast/slow, or impulsivity/deliberateness tradeoffs according to different models of behaviour. Regardless, it is generally assumed that decision latency reflects the neural mechanisms underlying behavioural strategy and cognitive investment. However, such investigations have been difficult in mice which are consistently impulsive. Here, we show that manipulating cost, using a novel floating-platform paradigm, overcomes the natural impulsivity of mice, more closely matching human behaviour. Furthermore, this approach allowed us simultaneously to measure the flow of activity from medial to lateral frontal cortex (MFC to LFC) and record sequences of single neuron activity with 2-photon imaging. Surprisingly, MFC display a different mode of operation, with high vulnerability to optical inhibition compared to LFC. Furthermore, the balance in choice coding at the beginning of sequences in MFC correlated with trial history and behavioural strategy. We found that for optimal performance, slow sequences in MFC showed declining numbers of active neurons whereas the opposite was true in LFC. Our results suggest that while LFC acts as an integrative motor threshold, MFC plays a larger cognitive role in the selection and timing of decisions than previously thought. Our study offers a methodological and mechanistic framework in mouse frontal cortex to understand the neural basis of voluntary decision making.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

This may be particularly useful for type 2 diabetes (T2D), a highly polygenic and heterogeneous disease where the additional predictive value of a PRS is unclear. Here, we use a meta-scoring approach to develop a metaPRS for T2D that incorporated genome-wide associations from both European and non-European genetic ancestries and T2D risk factors. We evaluated the performance of this metaPRS and benchmarked it against existing genome-wide PRS in 620,059 participants and 50,572 T2D cases amongst six diverse genetic ancestries from UK Biobank, INTERVAL, the All of Us Research Program, and the Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort. We show that our metaPRS was the most powerful PRS for predicting T2D in European population-based cohorts and had comparable performance to the top ancestry-specific PRS, highlighting its transferability. In UK Biobank, we show the metaPRS had stronger predictive power for 10-year risk than all individual risk factors apart from BMI and biomarkers of dysglycemia. The metaPRS modestly improved T2D risk stratification of QDiabetes risk scores for 10-year risk prediction, particularly when prioritising individuals for blood tests of dysglycemia.

Crop root systems are critical for water uptake and nutrient acquisition, which impacts yield. Quantitative trait phenotyping is essential to understand better the genetic factors underpinning maize root growth and development. Root systems are challenging to phenotype given their below-ground, soil-bound nature. In addition, manual trait annotations of root images are tedious and can lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies between individuals, resulting in data discrepancies. To address these issues, we have developed an automated phenotyping pipeline for field-grown maize crown roots by leveraging open-source software. Phenotypic variation of 20 maize genotypes from the Wisconsin Diversity panel was significant for numerous root traits, suggesting a genetic basis for the observed developmental deviations. In addition, juvenile root traits from controlled environment conditions exhibited inconsistent correlation with field-grown adult root traits, underscoring the developmental plasticity prevalent during maize root morphogenesis. Transcripts involved in hormone signaling and stress responses were among differentially expressed genes in roots from 20 maize genotypes, suggesting many molecular processes may underlie the observed phenotypic variance. This study furthers our understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships, which is relevant for informing agricultural strategies to improve maize root physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

Auxin-dependent transcriptional changes are mediated by DNA-binding Auxin Response Factors (ARF), whose AuxRE DNA binding sites are well-known. The identification of the first AuxRE showed this to be part of a composite element with a second motif. Indeed, systematic analysis showed other DNA motifs to be enriched in auxin-regulated promoters. Neither the basis for this enrichment nor the mechanisms for the activity of composite AuxREs is known. Here, we systematically mined Arabidopsis promoters for composite AuxRE elements enriched in auxin-responsive genes. We identified many and show that their presence is a reliable predictor of auxin response. Through mutating these elements and their higher-order modules, we demonstrate function in promoter activity. Lastly, we identified transcription factors (TFs) that bind AuxRE-associated motifs, showed their involvement in auxin response, and discovered that several of these TFs directly bind ARF proteins. We propose that ARF-TF complexes specifically bind compound motifs in promoters, and act as a source of diversification in auxin-dependent gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

The dynamics of traits and trait architectures under stabilizing selection have been extensively studied for single populations at steady state. However, natural populations are seldom at steady state and are often structured in some way. Admixture and introgression events may be common, including over human evolutionary history. Because stabilizing selection results in selection against the minor allele at a trait-affecting locus, alleles from the minor parental ancestry will be selected against after admixture. We show that the site-frequency spectrum can be used to model the genetic architecture of such traits, allowing for the study of trait architecture dynamics in complex multi-population settings. We use a simple deterministic two-locus model to predict the reduction of introgressed ancestry around trait-contributing loci. From this and individual-based simulations, we show that introgressed-ancestry deserts are enriched around such loci. When introgression between two diverged populations occurs in both directions, as has been inferred between humans and Neanderthals, the locations of introgressed-ancestry deserts will tend to be shared across populations. We argue that stabilizing selection for shared phenotypic optima may explain recent observations in which regions of depleted human-introgressed ancestry in the Neanderthal genome overlap with Neanderthal-ancestry deserts in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

High-accuracy, long-read sequencing can substantially improve SV characterization when coupled with effective calling methods. While state-of the-art long-read SV callers are highly accurate, further improvements are achievable by systematically modeling local haplotypes during SV discovery and genotyping.

ResultsWe describe sawfish, an SV caller for mapped high-quality long reads incorporating systematic SV haplotype modeling to improve accuracy and resolution. Assessment against the draft Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) SV benchmark from the T2T-HG002-Q100 diploid assembly shows that sawfish has the highest accuracy among state-of-the-art long-read SV callers across every tested SV size group. Additionally, sawfish maintains the highest accuracy at every tested depth level from 10 to 32-fold coverage, such that other callers required at least 30-fold coverage to match sawfish accuracy at 15-fold coverage. Sawfish also shows the highest accuracy in the GIAB challenging medically relevant genes benchmark, demonstrating improvements in both comprehensive and medically relevant contexts.

When joint-genotyping 10 samples from CEPH-1463, sawfish has over 9000 more pedigree-concordant calls than other state-of-the-art SV callers, with the highest proportion of concordant SVs (78%) as well. Sawfishs quality model can be used to select for an even higher proportion of concordant SVs (86%), while still calling over 5000 more pedigree-concordant SVs than other callers. These results demonstrate that sawfish improves on the state-of-the-art for long-read SV calling accuracy across both individual and joint-sample analyses.

Our GWAS detects many genome-wide significant loci, functional enrichments for Phagocytes, Liver, Adipose tissue, Macrophages and genetic correlations with autoimmune and cardiovascular disease. A common (7%) missense variant in DNASE1L3 (p.Arg206Cys), strongly affects all cfDNA properties. It increases the size of fragments, lowers cfDNA concentrations, affects the distribution of cleave-site motifs and increases the fraction of circulating fetal DNA during pregnancy. For the application of NIPT, and potentially other cfDNA-based tests, this variant has direct clinical consequences as it increases the odds of inconclusive results and impairs the sensitivity of NIPT by causing predictors to overestimate the fetal fraction.

To this end, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one the most used microbial host for recombinant protein production due to its rapid growth, well-characterised genetics, and ability to produce recombinant proteins in high yields using modern recombinant DNA technology. However, while there is a plethora of robust protein expression protocols for E. coli, these methods are often unsuitable for high-throughput screening due to their significant resource and time consumption; these protocols are also susceptible to operator error and inconsistency.

To address these challenges, we have developed APEX, a robust and automated protocol for recombinant protein production in E. coli. APEX leverages the accessible, open-source Opentrons OT-2 platform to automate microbial handling and protein expression with high precision and repro-ducibility. APEX can be configured to perform heat shock transformation, colony selection, colony sampling, inoculation, subculturing and protein expression using a low-cost, minimal OT-2 hardware setup. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our automated transformation workflows using a variety of plasmids (2.7-17.7 kb), and exemplify the automated heterologous expression of a diverse array of proteins (27-222 kDa). Designed with customization, modularity and user-friendliness in mind, APEX can be easily adapted to the operators needs without requiring any coding expertise.

For decades the field has used predominantly male rodents and focused on a sole conditioned fear response: freezing. However, recent work from our lab and others has identified darting as a female-biased conditioned response, characterized by an escape-like movement across a fear conditioning chamber. It is also accompanied by a behavioral phenotype: Darters reliably show decreased freezing compared to Non-darters and males and reach higher velocities in response to the foot shock (shock response). However, the relationship between shock response and conditioned darting is not known. This study investigated if this link is due to differences in general processing of aversive stimuli between Darters, Non-darters and males. Across a variety of modalities, including corticosterone measures, the acoustic startle test, and sensitivity to thermal pain, Darters were found not to be more reactive or sensitive to aversive stimuli, and, in some cases, they appear less reactive to Non-darters and males. Analyses of cFos activity in regions involved in pain and fear processing following fear conditioning identified discrete patterns of expression among Darters, Non-darters, and males exposed to low and high intensity foot shocks.

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137265

Using separation- of-function mutants, we discovered that RPA-mediated telomerase stimulation is indispensable for telomere elongation, while TPP1-POT1 primarily functions in recruiting telomerase to telomeres. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short telomere disease-associated telomerase mutations compromise RPAs ability to stimulate telomerase, establishing a link between impaired RPA-dependent processivity and telomeropathies.

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137265

The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56. Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset.

In aged mice, partial reprogramming, characterized by pulsed expression of reprogramming factors, has shown promise in improving function in various tissues, but its impact on the aging brain remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the impact of in vivo partial reprogramming on mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of young and aged mice. Using two different approaches - a neuron-specific transgenic reprogrammable mouse model and neuron-specific targeted lentiviral delivery of OSKM reprogramming factors - we demonstrated that in vivo partial reprogramming of mature neurons in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain, can influence animal behavior, and ameliorate age-related decline in memory and learning. These findings underscore the potential of in vivo partial reprogramming as an important therapeutic intervention to rejuvenate the neurogenic niche and ameliorate cognitive decline associated with aging or neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

As the zebrafish embryo grows into a larva, to improve its heart function, the embryonic myocardial wall transforms into an intricate 3D architecture, composed of an outer compact layer enveloping an inner layer of multicellular trabecular ridges. How these tissue layers acquire their characteristic form suited for their function remains an open question. Here, we find that multiscale mechanochemical coupling and an emergent tissue-scale morphological transition steer functional maturation of the developing zebrafish heart. Single-celled trabecular seeds recruit outer compact layer cells to mature into clonally heterogenous multicellular ridges, thereby amplifying cardiac contractile forces. In response, remaining compact layer cells are stretched, which impedes their further recruitment, thereby constraining trabecular ridge density. Concomitantly, Notch-dependent actomyosin dampening triggers a sharp transition in myocardial tissue area, activating rapid organ growth that expands blood filling capacity. Thus, multiscale self-organizing interactions optimize heart size and contractile efficiency to support embryonic life.","NA","biorxiv",1724537137265

In this study, we computationally model 1,804 protein complexes consisting of various H5 isolates from 1959 to 2024 against 11 HA1-neutralizing antibodies. This study shows a trend of weakening of the binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape of our medical defenses. We also found that based on the wide variety of host species and geographic locations in which H5N1 was observed to have been transmitted from birds to mammals, there is not a single central reservoir host species or location associated with H5N1s spread. These results indicate that the virus is well on its way to moving from epidemic to pandemic status in the near future.

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1724537137265
