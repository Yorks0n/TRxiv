The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in [~]400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and [~]13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56. Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy of evolutionary significance.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053658

However, the results of radiotherapy can vary widely across different cancer types and even among patients with the same type of cancer. This variability presents a major challenge in optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient survival. Here, we collected radiotherapy phenotype and expression data from 32 TCGA cancer datasets and performed overall survival analysis for 32 cancer types. Additionally, we conducted a signalling pathway enrichment analysis to identify key pathways involved in radiotherapy resistance and sensitivity. Our findings show that radiotherapy improves survival outcomes in certain cancer types, such as GBM, while worsening outcomes in others, such as LGG. Next, we focused on exploring the differences in radiotherapy outcomes between GBM and LGG, focusing on the molecular mechanisms contributing to these variations. The differential regulation of pathways related to programmed cell death, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, chromosome condensation, antiviral responses, and interferon signaling between GBM and LGG patients may elucidate the underlying reasons for these observed differences. These insights underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches and the need for further research to improve radiotherapy outcomes in cancer patients.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053658

But most viruses have limited cargo capacities, restricting their ability to carry large CRISPR-Cas systems. Here, we engineered tobacco rattle virus to carry the compact RNA-guided TnpB enzyme ISYmu1 and its guide RNA. This innovation allowed transgene-free editing of Arabidopsis thaliana in a single step, with edits inherited in the subsequent generation.

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation.

Gastrointestinal LC is relatively poorly understood. In this study we characterize a syndrome of persistent SARS-CoV2 viral material via clinical and histologic data, and RNA sequencing Methods We reviewed patients aged 5-22 years with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms from 6/2020-6/2023, excluding patients with known histologic disease. Biopsies were sent for immunohistochemical staining. Clinical data was collected. Duodenal, ileal, cecal, and sigmoid colon samples were stained for SARS-CoV-2 using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody. Slides were reviewed by a blinded pathologist. 8 patients with known duodenal SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (SC-NA) positivity and 8 demographically matched IBS matched patients from prior to 2020 were identified for RNA sequencing comparison. Results were compared with public data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository for intestinal tissue with IBS and epithelial tissues with active SARS-CoV2 infection. Results Of 30 patients, fifteen (50%) were identified to have positive SC-NA . 3 (20%) had received at least a single SARS-CoV2 vaccine in the + cohort, and 8 (53.3%) in the - (P=0.05). Primary symptoms were pain (86%, nausea (66.6%), and weight loss (60%). 37.5% of patients with colonic SC-NA displayed hematochezia. 33% of + patients showed elevated ESR/CRP. Mean + calprotectin was 317.3 vs. 156.4 (p=0.2). 11/15 (73.3%) +SC-NA had large lymphoid aggregates (LLA) (p = 0.00338). RNA expression was consistent with known acute SARS-CoV2 infection. Hub network analysis showed a tight shift in RNA expression centered around HSPE-1p26, with involvement of known SARS-CoV2 immune mediators like NEAT1. DGE comparative analysis with IBS and acute SARS-CoV2 infection showed higher overlap with acute infection vs. IBS. FGSEA analysis with the same source data demonstrated the same. Conclusions Our findings establish a syndrome mediated by persistent viral infection (SARS-CoV2 Persistent Intestinal Epithelial Syndrome (SPIES)).

These models were applied to an independent cohort of 1,336 participants with two MRI scans: either both before the pandemic (Controls) or one before and one after the pandemic onset (""Pandemic"" group). Our findings reveal that, even with matched brain age gaps initially, the pandemic significantly accelerated brain ageing. The ""Pandemic"" group showed on average 11-month higher deviation of predicted brain age vs. chronological age (brain age gap) at the second time point compared with controls. Accelerated brain ageing was more pronounced in males and those from deprived socio-demographic backgrounds, with average increases of 3.3 and 7 months, respectively. These deviations existed regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, accelerated brain ageing correlated with reduced cognitive performance only in COVID-infected participants.

By analysing 93 reporter lines, we were able to identify 20 different cell types or cell states, many of which have not been described before. We additionally observed distinct transcriptome signatures of parenchyma cells depending on their maturation state and proximity to the conductive cell types. Our data shows that both xylem and phloem parenchyma tissues are required for normal formation of conductive tissue cell types. Furthermore, we showed that mature phloem parenchyma gradually obtains periderm identity, and this transition can be accelerated by jasmonate or wounding. Thus, our study reveals the remarkable dynamic and diverse nature of parenchyma cells during secondary growth.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

We sampled 190 individuals including juvenile and mature trees belonging to 18 temperate broadleaved tree species and 9 genera. We measured guard cell length (GCL), stomatal density (SD), specific leaf area (SLA), gas-exchange, iWUE and leaf {delta}13C as a proxy for long-term WUE. Leaf {delta}13C correlated positively with iWUE for both juvenile and mature trees. Across species, GCL showed a negative and SD a positive effect on iWUE and leaf {delta}13C of both juvenile and mature trees. Within species, however, only GCL was significantly associated with iWUE and leaf {delta}13C. Pioneer species (Populus, Prunus, Betula) showed a significantly lower leaf {delta}13C than climax forest species (Fagus, Quercus, Tilia), but the differentiation was not clear for iWUE.

Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation.

However, implementing realistic and stable simulations in continuous space presents a variety of difficulties, from modeling choices to computational efficiency. This paper aims to be a practical guide to spatial simulation, helping researchers to implement realistic and efficient spatial, individual-based simulations and avoid common pitfalls. To do this, we delve into mechanisms of mating, reproduction, density-dependent feedback, and dispersal, all of which may vary across the landscape, discuss how these affect population dynamics, and describe how to parameterize simulations in convenient ways (for instance, to achieve a desired population density). We also demonstrate how to implement these models using the current version of the individual-based simulator, SLiM. Since SLiM has the capacity to simulate genomes, we also discuss natural selection---in particular, how genetic variation can affect demographic processes. Finally, we provide four short vignettes: simulations of pikas that shift their range up a mountain as temperatures rise; mosquitoes that live in rivers as juveniles and experience seasonally changing habitat; cane toads that expand across Australia, reaching 120 million individuals; and monarch butterflies whose populations are regulated by an explicitly modeled resource (milkweed).","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

However, whether Gram-negative bacteria, which are known to manipulate the host membranous system, regulate ER-phagy remains elusive. We find that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released upon infection with Salmonella Typhimurium colocalizes with FAM134B, a reticulon-like protein that operates as an ER-phagy receptor. Pulldown assays reveal that LPS binds directly to FAM134B. The interaction occurs via lipid A of LPS and positively charged amino acid residues on the amphipathic helices and C-terminal region of FAM134B. Upon binding, O-Antigen of LPS promotes FAM134B oligomerization and ER fragmentation in in vitro liposome membrane remodeling assays. Delivery of LPS into the cytoplasm via transfection significantly increases the number of FAM134B-LC3B-decorated ER fragments, which are recruited to Salmonella-containing vacuoles. Both intracellular and extracellular bacteria use outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to deliver LPS into the cytosol for FAM134B activation and ER fragmentation. Taken together, our results show that Gram-negative bacteria subvert the host ER remodeling system to create bacteria-containing vacuoles that provide a niche for bacterial survival.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

We sought to contribute to the limited structural knowledge within the Gammacoronavirus genera and determined the structure of the viral core replication-transcription complex (RTC) from Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) using single-particle cryo-EM. Comparison between our IBV structure with published RTC structures from other Coronavirinae genera reveals structural differences across genera. Using in vitro biochemical assays, we characterized these differences and revealed their differing involvement in core RTC formation across different genera. Our findings highlight the value of cross-genera Coronavirinae studies, as they show genera specific features in coronavirus genome replication.

However, the identities of such mechanisms have remained elusive. A screen for hippocampal dentate granule cell (DGC) synapse loss-induced factors identified a secreted phospholipase, Pla2g2f, whose expression increases in DGCs during aging. Pla2g2f deletion in DGCs exacerbates aging-associated pathophysiological changes including synapse loss, inflammatory microglia, reactive astrogliosis, impaired neurogenesis, lipid dysregulation and hippocampal-dependent memory loss. Conversely, boosting Pla2g2f in DGCs during aging is sufficient to preserve synapses, reduce inflammatory microglia and reactive gliosis, prevent hippocampal-dependent memory impairment and modify trajectory of cognitive decline. Ex vivo, neuronal-PLA2G2F mediates intercellular signaling to decrease lipid droplet burden in microglia.

These immune receptors detect pathogen infection by sensing virulence effector proteins. However, the mechanisms by which receptors evolve new recognition specificities remain poorly understood. Here we report that a plant NLR has evolved the capacity to bind to a pathogen effector by acting as a molecular mimic of a virulence target of the effector, thereby triggering an immune response. The barley NLR Mildew Locus A 3 (MLA3) confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae by recognizing the effector Pwl2. Using structural analysis, we show that MLA3 has acquired the capacity to bind and respond to Pwl2 through molecular mimicry of the effector host target HIPP43. We demonstrate that the amino acids at the binding interface of MLA3 and Pwl2 are highly conserved in interface of HIPP43 with Pwl2, and are required to trigger an immune response. We used this discovery to bioengineer SR50-an MLA ortholog in rye that confers resistance to wheat stem rust-by introducing the Pwl2 binding interface of MLA3. This chimeric receptor has dual recognition activities, binding and responding to effectors from two major cereal pathogens. Collectively, these results provide evidence that plant immune receptors have evolved sophisticated mimicry strategies to counteract pathogen attack.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

One rapid response to mitochondrial damage is peri-mitochondrial actin polymerization within 2 mins, which we term ADA (Acute Damaged-induced Actin). ADA is vital for a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis upon mitochondrial dysfunction. In the current study we investigated the effect of ADA on Pink1/Parkin mediated mitochondrial quality control. We show that inhibition of proteins involved in the ADA pathway significantly accelerates Parkin recruitment onto depolarized mitochondria. Addressing the mechanism by which ADA resists Parkin recruitment onto depolarized mitochondria, we found that ADA disrupts ERmitochondrial contacts in an Arp2/3 complex-dependent manner. Interestingly, over-expression of ER-mitochondrial tethers overrides the effect of ADA, allowing rapid recruitment of not only Parkin but also LC3 after mitochondrial depolarization. During chronic mitochondrial dysfunction, Parkin and LC3 recruitment are completely blocked, which is reversed rapidly by inhibiting ADA. Taken together we show that ADA acts as a protective mechanism, delaying mitophagy following acute damage, and blocking mitophagy during chronic mitochondrial damage.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

The atomic structures of amyloid fibrils have now been determined, but the process by which soluble proteins nucleate to form amyloids remains poorly characterised and difficult to study, even though this is the key step to understand to prevent the formation and spread of aggregates. Here we use massively parallel combinatorial mutagenesis, a kinetic selection assay, and machine learning to reveal the transition state of the nucleation reaction of amyloid beta, the protein that aggregates in Alzheimer's disease. By quantifying the nucleation of >140,000 proteins we infer the changes in activation energy for all 798 amino acid substitutions in amyloid beta and the energetic couplings between >600 pairs of mutations. This unprecedented dataset provides the first comprehensive view of the energy landscape and the first large-scale measurement of energetic couplings for a protein transition state. The energy landscape reveals that the amyloid beta nucleation transition state contains a short structured C-terminal hydrophobic core with a subset of interactions similar to mature fibrils. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using mutation-selection-sequencing experiments to study transition states and identifies the key molecular species that initiates amyloid beta aggregation and, potentially, Alzheimer's disease.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

To investigate this, we simultaneously recorded neural activity from the frontal and parietal cortex, higher-order thalamic nuclei, and core basal ganglia structures during color and spatial working memory tasks in non-human primates. We found widespread yet differential encoding of color and spatial information, marked by area-specific temporal dynamics and modulation according to task demands. Both cortical and subcortical information increased towards working memory-dependent actions, suggesting a task-specific reloading of information. Directed interactions between cortical and subcortical regions were extensive and reciprocal, with dominant directions of information flow, especially from frontoparietal areas. These interactions were dynamically modulated and partially task specific.

Therefore, we performed the first multivariate genome-wide association study of the latent genetic architecture between 30 frailty deficits, which identified 408 genomic risk loci.

DesignObservational population-based study.

SettingScotland, 2000-2019. Linked psychiatric hospital admission and death records.

ParticipantsAdults with a psychiatric hospital admission record for schizophrenia (28,797), bipolar disorder (16,657) or major depression (72,504) compared with the Scottish population (4.3 million adults in 2011).

Main outcome measuresTrends over time in life years lost for people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression compared with the Scottish population, for all deaths, and natural and unnatural deaths, stratified by sex.

ResultsAmong people with SMI, one third died during the study period. Between 2000 and 2019, LE increased in the general Scottish population and the LE gap widened for people with schizophrenia. For 2000-2002, men and women with schizophrenia lost an excess 9.4 (95% CI 8.5 to 10.3) and 8.2 (7.4 to 9.0) life years, respectively, compared to the general population. In 2017-2019, this excess life years lost increased to 11.8 (10.9 to 12.7) and 11.1 (10.0 to 12.1) for men and women, respectively. There was no evidence of a change over time in the LE gap of 5 to 8 years for people with bipolar disorder or major depression. Changes in LE for natural and unnatural causes of death varied by individual SMI and sex.

ConclusionsThe LE gap in people with an SMI persisted or widened in Scotland from 2000-2019. These entrenched disparities reflect intersecting inequalities requiring coordinated solutions at multiple levels to improve LE in this and other marginalised and socially excluded groups.

One of the most striking environmental adaptations is entry into hibernation during which core body temperature can decrease from 37C to as low at 4C. How mammalian cells, which evolved to optimally function within a narrow range of temperatures, adapt to this profound decrease in temperature remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted the first genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen in cells derived from Syrian hamster, a facultative hibernator, as well as human cells to investigate the genetic basis of cold tolerance in a hibernator and a non-hibernator in an unbiased manner. Both screens independently revealed glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a selenium-containing enzyme, and associated proteins as critical for cold tolerance. We utilized genetic and pharmacological approaches to demonstrate that GPX4 is active in the cold and its catalytic activity is required for cold tolerance. Furthermore, we show that the role of GPX4 as a suppressor of cold-induced cell death extends across hibernating species, including 13-lined ground squirrels and greater horseshoe bats, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this mechanism of cold tolerance. This study identifies GPX4 as a central modulator of mammalian cold tolerance and advances our understanding of the evolved mechanisms by which cells mitigate cold-associated damage - one of the most common challenges faced by cells and organisms in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

Bifacially flaked core tools - which technologically define the tradition - are sometimes regionally and periodically absent within the Acheuleans boundaries. Biface presence is broadly associated with, but rarely formally tested against, environmental conditions. Here, we investigate biface presence/absence and climate/ecological variation at a continental scale between 726 and 130ka. Using a comprehensive sample of European sites matched to paleoenvironmental reconstructions, we demonstrate clear associations between Acheulean presence and specific environments. Acheulean habitat suitability was most strongly associated with mean winter temperatures above -5/-10{degrees}C, and precipitation of the driest month above 15 mm. Two major habitats, warm forest/woodland and shrubland, comprised the European Acheulean niche. Acheulean spatial presence was reconstructed through time: during interglacial and glacial periods it covered most of southwestern Europe, but extended along northern coastal routes during interglacials. Central and Eastern Europe always remained unsuitable. The Acheulean was excluded from areas experiencing both low winter temperatures and low summer precipitation, but reached areas including only one of those two climatic extremes, suggesting seasonal migrations to avoid the harshest seasons. These analyses explain current Acheulean site distributions in Europe and suggest strong links between handaxes, specific ecological conditions, and prehistoric demographic patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

In insects, the neck connective is both a physical and information bottleneck connecting the brain and the ventral nerve cord (VNC, spinal cord analogue) and comprises diverse populations of descending (DN), ascending (AN) and sensory ascending neurons, which are crucial for sensorimotor signalling and control.

Integrating three separate EM datasets, we now provide a complete connectomic description of the ascending and descending neurons of the female nervous system of Drosophila and compare them with neurons of the male nerve cord. Proofread neuronal reconstructions have been matched across hemispheres, datasets and sexes. Crucially, we have also matched 51% of DN cell types to light level data defining specific driver lines as well as classifying all ascending populations.

We use these results to reveal the general architecture, tracts, neuropil innervation and connectivity of neck connective neurons. We observe connected chains of descending and ascending neurons spanning the neck, which may subserve motor sequences. We provide a complete description of sexually dimorphic DN and AN populations, with detailed analysis of circuits implicated in sex-related behaviours, including female ovipositor extrusion (DNp13), male courtship (DNa12/aSP22) and song production (AN hemilineage 08B). Our work represents the first EM-level circuit analyses spanning the entire central nervous system of an adult animal.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

Development of biomarkers for amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau protein aggregates, the hallmark pathologies of AD, have improved patient monitoring/stratification and drug development, but they still only explain 20-40% of the variance in cognitive impairment (CI) in AD. To discover additional molecular drivers and biomarkers of AD dementia, we perform cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,416 individuals from six deeply phenotyped prospective AD case-control cohorts. We identify synapse proteins as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of A{beta} and tau. Using machine learning we derive the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, a robust correlate of CI, which explains 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF PTau181:A{beta}42, 10% beyond tau PET, and 50% beyond CSF NfL in A{beta} positive individuals. We find YWHAG:NPTX2 also increases with normal aging as early as age 20 and increases at a faster rate in APOE4 carriers and autosomal dominant-AD mutation carriers. Most notably, YWHAG:NPTX2+ individuals (top 25th percentile) are 15-times (HR=15.4 [10.6-22.2]) more likely to experience cognitive decline over 15 years compared to YWHAG:NPTX2- individuals (bottom 25th percentile), and this rises to 19-times (HR=18.9 [10.83-32.9]) with additional stratification by A{beta} and phosphorylated tau status. Lastly, we perform plasma proteomics on 4,245 individuals to develop a plasma-based signature of CI which partly recapitulates CSF YWHAG:NPTX2. Overall, our findings underscore CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 and the corresponding plasma signature as robust prognostic biomarkers for AD onset and progression beyond gold-standard biomarkers of A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration and implicate synapse dysfunction as a core driver of AD dementia.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053658

Here, we describe SAVANA, a computationally efficient algorithm designed for the joint analysis of somatic SVs, SCNAs, tumour purity and ploidy using long-read sequencing data. SAVANA relies on machine learning to distinguish true somatic SVs from artefacts and provide prediction errors for individual SVs. Using high-depth Illumina and nanopore whole-genome sequencing data for 99 human tumours and matched normal samples, we establish best practices for benchmarking SV detection algorithms across the entire genome in an unbiased and data-driven manner using simulated and sequencing replicates of tumour and matched normal samples. SAVANA shows significantly higher sensitivity, and 9- and 59-times higher specificity than the second and third-best performing algorithms, yielding orders of magnitude fewer false positives in comparison to existing long-read sequencing tools across various clonality levels, genomic regions, SV types and SV sizes. In addition, SAVANA harnesses long-range phasing information to detect somatic SVs and SCNAs at single-haplotype resolution. SVs reported by SAVANA are highly consistent with those detected using short-read sequencing, including complex events causing oncogene amplification and tumour suppressor gene inactivation. In summary, SAVANA enables the application of long-read sequencing to detect SVs and SCNAs reliably in clinical samples.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

DMD satellite cells were disproportionally found within myogenic progenitor clusters and a unique DMD enriched cluster. DMD satellite cells and myogenic progenitors exhibited distinct impairments, including cell death and senescence, respectively. Moreover, dystrophic satellite cells express an impaired myogenic differentiation gene signature and are stalled in their differentiation capacity. We found that inducing autophagy, which is reduced in DMD progenitors, led to enhanced differentiation. Our findings provide molecular evidence of satellite cell dysfunction in DMD and suggest pathways to target and enhance their regenerative capacity.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

Memory processing is critically dependent on adult neurogenesis, a unique form of plasticity in the hippocampus. However, it remains unknown if cognitive aging influences the integration and role of adult-born hippocampal neurons (ABNs) generated early in adult life. Here, we investigated the role of long-lived ABNs in rats characterized as either resilient or vulnerable to cognitive aging using a peudo-longitudinal approach. Our findings reveal that long-lived ABNs support successful cognitive aging by preserving their synaptic inputs onto the proximal segments of their dendrites, and that these proximal synaptic sites also demonstrate a maintenance of their mitochondrial homeostasis. Furthermore, by-passing the reduced inputs of ABNs in vulnerable rats through direct optogenetic stimulation successfully improved their memory abilities. Overall, our data indicate that the maintenance of long-lived ABNs integration within the neuronal network is essential for successful cognitive aging, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic target for restoring cognitive functions in old age.

Here, we identify Adig as a critical regulator for lipid droplet formation in adipocytes. We determine that Adig interacts directly with seipin, leading to the formation of a rigid complex. We solve the structure of the seipin/Adig complex by Cryo-EM at 2.98A overall resolution. Surprisingly, seipin can form two unique oligomers, undecamers and dodecamers. Adig selectively binds to the dodecameric seipin complex. We further find that Adig promotes seipin assembly by stabilizing and bridging adjacent seipin subunits. Functionally, Adig plays a key role in generating lipid droplets in adipocytes. In mice, inducible overexpression of Adig in adipocytes substantially increases fat mass, with enlarged lipid droplets. It also elevates thermogenesis during cold exposure. In contrast, inducible adipocyte-specific Adig knockout mice manifest aberrant lipid droplet formation in brown adipose tissues and impaired cold tolerance.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

Whether existing scores provide similar individual-level assessments of disease liability is a critical consideration for clinical implementation that remains uncharacterized. Objective: Characterize the reliability of CAD PRSs that perform equivalently at the population level at predicting individual-level risk. Design: Cross-sectional Study. Setting: All of Us Research Program (AOU), Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB), and UCLA ATLAS Precision Health Biobank. Participants: Volunteers of diverse genetic backgrounds enrolled in AOU, PMBB, and UCLA with available electronic health record and genotyping data. Exposures: Polygenic risk for CAD from previously published PRSs and new PRSs developed separately from the testing cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sets of CAD PRSs that perform population prediction equivalently were identified by comparing calibration and discrimination (Brier score and AUROC) of generalized linear models of prevalent CAD using Bayesian analysis of variance. Among equivalently performing scores, individual-level agreement between risk estimates was tested with intraclass correlation (ICC) and Light's Kappa, measures of inter-rater reliability. Results: 50 PRSs were calculated for 171,095 AOU participants. When included in a model of prevalent CAD, 48 scores had practically equivalent Brier scores and AUROCs (region of practical equivalence = 0.02). Across these scores, 84% of participants had at least one score in both the top and bottom risk quintile. Continuous agreement of individual risk predictions from the 48 scores was poor, with an ICC of 0.351 (95% CI; 0.349, 0.352). Agreement between two statistically equivalent scores was moderate, with an ICC of 0.649 (95% CI; 0.646, 0.652). Light's Kappa, used to evaluate consistency of assignment to high-risk thresholds, did not exceed 0.56 (interpreted as 'fair') across statistically and practically equivalent scores. Repeating the analysis among 41,193 PMBB and 50,748 UCLA participants yielded different sets of statistically and practically equivalent scores which also lacked strong individual agreement. Conclusions and Relevance: Across three diverse biobanks, CAD PRSs that performed equivalently at the population level produced unreliable individual risk estimates. Approaches to clinical implementation of CAD PRSs must consider the potential for discordant individual risk estimates from otherwise indistinguishable scores.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053658

Notably, ChromBERT was pre-trained on promoter regions across a diverse range of epigenomes and subsequently fine-tuned using a dataset from multiple cell lines where RNA-seq data were available, highlighting the model's ability to discern conserved chromatin state patterns within these regions. In addition to its predictive powers across tasks, evidenced by high AUC scores, ChromBERT provides further analysis through the incorporation of motif clustering using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). This method enhances the model's ability to dissect chromatin state sequence motifs, typically involving transcription and enhancer sites.

While many nucleoside analogues have exhibited broad-spectrum activity against a wide range of viruses, their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 is limited. The lack of activity is hypothesized to be attributed to the proofreading function of viral nsp14 exonuclease. In this study, the role of the nsp14 proofreading in modulating nucleoside antiviral activity was investigated using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Introduction of exonuclease attenuation or disabling mutations to nsp14 led to either severe replication defect or increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replicons to specific nucleoside analogues. In contrast, repurposing of HCV NS5A inhibitors to suppress nsp14 exonuclease activity is insufficient to enhance the potency of nucleoside analogues. These findings provided further support for nsp14 as a target for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral development and highlighted the complex interplay between nsp14 proofreading and RNA replication.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

However, the mechanisms causing adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance remain unclear. Here, we show that excess cholesterol induces adipocyte dysfunction, which is suppressed by the transcription factor Nfe2l1 (nuclear factor erythroid derived-2, like-1). Nfe2l1 is required to sustain proteasome function in adipocytes and proteotoxic stress induces adipocyte inflammation via the activation of Atf3. In humans, the Nfe2l1-proteasome pathway is inversely correlated to body mass index (BMI) in an adipose-depot specific manner. In mice, loss of adipocyte Nfe2l1 caused AT inflammation with a pronounced infiltration of macrophages and T cells. Mice lacking adipocyte Nfe2l1 displayed severe adipocyte dysfunction during diet-induced obesity (DIO), characterized by lower adipokine levels, steatosis, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Nfe2l1{Delta}AT mice on an Apoe-deficient (Apoe-/-) background fed a cholesterol-rich Western Diet (WD), developed a lipoatrophy-like syndrome, dyslipidemia, and enhanced atherosclerosis. Our results reveal an important role for proteasome-mediated proteostasis in adipocytes and indicate that Nfe2l1 is linked to metabolic health in humans and preclinical mouse models. Promoting proteostasis in adipocytes may thus alleviate inflammation in obesity, potentially averting adverse cardiometabolic outcomes.

Electron microscopy provides the necessary resolution, yet - as electrons penetrate samples for only a few 100s of nm - requires physical sectioning or ablation. This provides a significant challenge when aiming to scale up anatomical investigations to entire organs such as mammalian brains. X-ray nanotomography has been suggested as a promising alternative for ultrastructural 3d imaging without physical sectioning(1-15). Leveraging the high brilliance of 4th generation synchrotron X-ray sources, it has the theoretical potential to non-destructively acquire mm^3-sized samples at ultrastructural resolution within a few days(16). A fundamental barrier to the practical implementation has been that, when irradiated with high-intensity X-rays, biological samples deform and ultimately disintegrate, prohibiting reaching sufficient resolution. Here, we demonstrate that X-ray ptychography(17), a coherent diffractive X-ray imaging technique, can faithfully acquire 3-dimensional images of metal-stained mouse neuronal tissue. Achieving high imaging quality requires minimization of the radiation damage to the sample, which we achieve by imaging at cryogenic temperatures and using tailored non-rigid tomographic reconstruction algorithms(18). Adapting an epoxy resin developed for the nuclear and aerospace industry, we demonstrate radiation resistance to X-ray doses exceeding 10^10 Gy. Sub-40 nm isotropic resolution makes it possible to densely resolve axon bundles, boutons, dendrites and reliably identify synapses without physical sectioning. Moreover, the tissue volumes exposed to X-rays can subsequently be imaged in 3D using high-resolution focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM)(19, 20) showing intact ultrastructure and demonstrating that metal-stained neuronal tissue can be highly radiation-stable. Thus, our work removes the fundamental limitations to employing X-ray tomography for high-resolution tissue imaging. Ongoing improvements in synchrotron, X-ray and detector physics(21), as well as further optimization of sample preparation and staining procedures(22-27), could lead to substantial improvements in acquisition speed(16), whilst complementary X-ray techniques such as laminography(28-31) and nano-holotomography(2, 32) could allow for non-destructive X-ray imaging of synapses and neural circuits in volumes of increasing size.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

Therefore, we leverage longitudinal antibody and reinfection probabilities with spatiotemporal projections of COVID-19 incidence to develop a geographically-informed approach to optimizing the timing of booster vaccination. Additionally, we assess the delay in booster vaccination that is warranted following breakthrough infections whenever they occur during the year, enabling an approach that acknowledges and respects diverse immune statuses, thereby addressing a substantial barrier to uptake.

While relationships between circuit function and behavior have been well studied, how evolution shapes those circuits and leads to behavioral adpation is poorly understood. The Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, provides a unique genetically amendable model system, equipped with above ground eyed surface fish and multiple evolutionarily divergent populations of blind cavefish that have evolved in complete darkness. These differences in environment and vision provide an opprotunity to examine how a neural circuit is functionally influenced by the presence of light. Here, we examine differences in the detection, and behavioral response induced by non visual light reception. Both populations exhibit photokinetic behavior, with surface fish becoming hyperactive following sudden darkness and cavefish becoming hyperactive following sudden illumination. To define these photokinetic neural circuits, we integrated whole brain functional imaging with our Astyanax brain atlas for surface and cavefish responding to light changes. We identified the caudal posterior tuberculum as the central modulator for both light or dark stimulated photokinesis. To unconver how spatiotemporal neuronal activity differed between surface fish and cavefish, we used stable pan-neuronal GCaMP Astyanax transgenics to show that a subpopulation of darkness sensitve neurons in surface fish are now light senstive in cavefish. Further functional analysis revealed that this integrative switch is dependent on dopmane signaling, suggesting a key role for dopamine and a highly conserved dopamine circuit in modulating the evolution of a circuit driving an essential behavior. Together, these data shed light into how neural circuits evolved to adapte to novel settings, and reveal the power of Astyanax as a model to elucidate mechanistic ingiths underlying sensory adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053658

In order to maintain genome integrity DNA repair pathways must be efficiently activated to prevent mutations and deleterious chromosomal rearrangements. Conversely, genome flexibility is also necessary to allow genetic diversity and evolution. The antagonist interaction between maintenance of genome integrity and flexibility determines genome shape and organization. Therefore, it is of great interest to understand how the whole linear genome structure behaves upon formation and repair of DNA damage. For this, we used long reads sequencing technology to identify and to characterize genomic structural variations (SV) of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana somatic cells exposed either to UV-B, to UV-C or to protons irradiations. We found that genomic regions located in heterochromatin a more prone to form SVs than those located in euchromatin, highlighting that genome stability and flexibility differs along the chromosome. This holds true in Arabidopsis plants deficient for the expression of master regulators of the DNA Damage Response (DDR), ATM and ATR, suggesting that independent and alternative surveillance processes exist to maintain integrity in genic regions.

We quantified the motility of individual cells and entire colonies and demonstrated that Chfl MS-1 formed bundles of filaments that moved in all directions with no directional bias to light. Syn OS-B' was slightly less motile but exhibited positive phototaxis. This binary consortium displayed cooperative behavior by moving further than either species alone and formed ordered arrays where both species aligned with the light source. No cooperative motility was observed when a non-motile pilB mutant of Syn OS-B' was used instead of Syn OS-B'.

Consequently, they typically grow-up lacking an accurate understanding of what it means to be autistic on both a collective and individual level (2). Without this foundational knowledge, childrens understanding of autism is garnered from how others perceive their autism, resulting in an understanding of autism, and of themselves, that is inherently negative (3). This lack of appreciation of their own individual needs, also denies them the important self-understanding afforded by the diagnosis in the first instance, alongside the opportunity to effectively self-advocate for themselves when these needs go unmet.

AimsHere we sought to directly assess the benefit of a pre-recorded, online autistic-led psychoeducation course about autism and the lived experience of being autistic (i.e.,  NeuroBears https://www.pandasonline.org), for childrens understanding of autism and their autistic experiences, their feeling about being autistic, their communication with others about their autistic experiences, and their confidence to self-advocate for their needs.

MethodsUsing a concurrent embedded mixed-methods, repeated-measures design, autistic children (aged 8-14 years), completed a bespoke questionnaire exploring the above topics, both before and after completing NeuroBears at home with a nominated safe adult. A total of 63 children (mean age=10.57 years) completed sufficient content to be included in the analysis.

ResultsSignificant benefit was observed across a range of areas, including a significant improvement in the childrens knowledge and understanding of being autistic and of their unique strengths and challenges, a significant rebalancing of how the children viewed being autistic, evidence of emerging positive autistic identities and a growing sense of belongingness, a significant change in the childrens abilities to communicate about being autistic, and evidence of strengthening self-advocacy skills.

ConclusionLearning about autism in a neutral and non-stigmatizing manner, and presented through the lens of autistic lived experience, conferred numerous benefits on autistic childrens self-understanding, emergent autistic identity, sense of belonging, and on their communication/self-advocacy skills. Future work is needed to establish the downstream benefits on wellbeing and quality of life.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053658

However, it is not well understood how cell-surface RNA (csRNA) is stably present on the plasma membrane and what functions it performs on the cell surface. By exploiting the RNA-sensing ability of TLR7 as a specific recombinant probe to detect csRNA and coupling it with a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-knockout screening to identify genes essential for csRNA presentation on cells, we identified heparan sulfate (HS) as a crucial factor for RNA presentation on cells. Using the TLR7 binding probe, cell surface proximity labelling revealed that csRNA associates mechanistically with a plethora of RNA-binding proteins, and these interactions are crucial for csRNA presentation. Moreover, csRNA modulates receptor-ligand interactions between poliovirus receptor (PVR) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DL5 (KIR2DL5) by acting as a co-binder, recruiting the latter to cell surface. We provide a mechanistic understanding of csRNA presentation and unveil a new layer of complexity in the csRNA-dictated regulation of cell surface receptor-ligand interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Exclusively polycistronic transcripts are prevalent in green algae, although the mechanism by which multiple polypeptides are translated from a single transcript is unknown. Here, we used bioinformatic and in vivo mutational analyses to evaluate competing mechanistic models for polycistronic expression in green algae. High-confidence manually curated datasets of bicistronic loci from two divergent green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Auxenochlorella protothecoides, revealed 1) a preference for weak Kozak-like sequences for ORF 1 and 2) an underrepresentation of potential initiation codons before ORF 2, which are suitable conditions for leaky scanning to allow ORF 2 translation. We used mutational analysis in Auxenochlorella protothecoides to test the mechanism. In vivo manipulation of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence and start codon altered reporter expression at ORF 2, with a weaker Kozak-like sequence enhancing expression and a stronger one diminishing it. A synthetic bicistronic dual reporter demonstrated inversely adjustable activity of green fluorescent protein expressed from ORF 1 and luciferase from ORF 2, depending on the strength of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence. Our findings demonstrate that translation of multiple ORFs in green algal bicistronic transcripts is consistent with episodic leaky ribosome scanning of ORF 1 to allow translation at ORF 2. This work has implications for the potential functionality of upstream open reading frames found across eukaryotic genomes and for transgene expression in synthetic biology applications.

Significance StatementTextbook dogma states that nucleus-encoded genes are monocistronic, producing transcripts with a single translated open reading frame. However, highly conserved bicistronic loci are pervasive in green algae that are separated by several hundred million years of evolution, speaking to their ancestral origins and functions within the Chlorophyte lineage. A combination of bioinformatic analysis and in vivo gene manipulation supports leaky ribosomal scanning as the primary mechanism for translation of multiple ORFs from bicistronic transcripts. We have successfully tuned synthesis levels of two proteins encoded on one mRNA by modifying the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence. These findings may have broad applications in synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Studies have linked its presence with distinct gut microbiome and metabolome profiles compared to those where the organism is absent. However, the in vivo effect of antibiotics on Blastocystis and the surrounding gut microbiome remains understudied. This case study aimed to explore how antibiotic consumption influences the presence of Blastocystis and the subsequent changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome of an individual with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Methods: Stool samples from an IBS patient, collected at various time points, were tested for Blastocystis presence using RT-PCR targeting the SSUrRNA gene, followed by sequencing of positive samples. Illumina sequencing determined the gut microbiome composition, while one-dimensional proton NMR spectroscopy analysed the metabolome composition. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify relationships between antibiotic consumption, bacterial diversity, metabolome composition, and Blastocystis presence. Results: Antibiotics significantly impacted the gut microbiome, with diversity declining early in the antibiotic course, then recovering later and post-course. Blastocystis was detected early, late, and post-course but not mid-course, coinciding with the decline in bacterial diversity. No significant differences were observed between Blastocystis-positive and Blastocystis-negative samples. However, bacterial composition significantly differed between samples collected before, early, and after the antibiotic course compared to those collected mid-course. Metabolite groups, including short-chain fatty acids, amino acids, and succinate, exhibited changes throughout the antibiotic course, indicating that gut metabolite composition is affected by antibiotic consumption. Discussion/Conclusion: While antibiotics did not significantly impact Blastocystis colonisation, they did cause a mid-course decline in microbial diversity and Blastocystis presence. The study also revealed significant alterations in important metabolites such as SCFAs and amino acids throughout the antibiotic course, with an altered metabolome observed post-course. This case study underscores the complex interactions between antibiotics, gut microbiota, and metabolites, highlighting the resilience of Blastocystis in the gut ecosystem.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053659

In this view, the precise timing in the transcriptional activation of these genes may impact upon body length. Unlike other Hox clusters, HoxB lacks all posterior genes between Hoxb9 and Hoxb13, two genes separated by a ca. 70 kb large DNA segment containing an unusually high number of CTCF sites, suggesting it isolates Hoxb13 from the rest of the cluster, thereby delaying its negative impact on trunk extension. We deleted the spacer DNA to induce a potential heterochronic gain of function of Hoxb13 at physiological concentration and observed a shortening of the tail as well as other abnormal phenotypes, which were all rescued by inactivating Hoxb13 in-cis with the deletion. A comparable gain of function was observed in mutant ES cells grown as pseudo-embryos in vitro, which allowed us to examine in details the importance of both the number and the orientation of CTCF sites in the insulating activity of the DNA spacer. A short cassette containing all the CTCF sites was sufficient to insulate Hoxb13 from the rest of HoxB and additional modifications of this CTCF cassette showed that two CTCF sites in convergent orientations are already capable of importantly delaying Hoxb13 activation in these conditions. We discuss the relative importance of genomic distance versus number and orientation of CTCF sites in preventing Hoxb13 to be activated too early during trunk extension and hence to modulate tail length.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Palm1 binds to the N-terminal region of {beta}II-spectrin, a core MPS component, and is periodically organized along the axon in hippocampal neurons. Applying the 3D imaging power of MINFLUX, we locate Palm1 in close proximity (<20 nm) to the actin-capping protein and MPS component adducin. Functionally, Palm1 overexpression enhances the degree of periodicity of several MPS proteins ({beta}II-spectrin, adducin, and ankyrinB) without altering their local concentrations, while the knock-out severely compromises the MPS structure and modifies electrophysiological properties of neurons. Both the MPS-binding and remodelling activities of Palm1 are abolished by mutating a single amino acid (W54A) in the conserved Paralemmin sequence motif. Our findings identify Palm1 as the first protein specifically dedicated to organizing the MPS, and will advance the understanding of the regulation of MPS assembly and remodelling, as well as of the Paralemmin protein family.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

However, ensuring sensitive and robust rare variant association testing is challenging due to the scarcity of high-impact rare-allele carriers. Here we introduce FuncRVP, a Bayesian rare variant association framework that addresses this issue by leveraging functional gene embeddings, i.e. multidimensional representations of gene function. FuncRVP models the accumulated effects of rare variants on traits as a weighted sum of rare-variant gene impairment scores. A prior, learnt from data, regularizes the weight of each gene depending on the location of the gene in a functional gene embedding. We investigated this approach on 41 quantitative traits from unrelated UK Biobank exome samples. For the gene impairment score, we found that DeepRVAT scores strongly outperformed loss-of-function variant counts. Moreover, effective weight regularizations were obtained when using a prior on gene weight variance, but not on gene weight expectation. Compared to linear regressions on significantly associated genes, FuncRVP typically improved trait prediction, and did so more effectively for traits with higher burden heritability. Moreover, FuncRVP led to more robust gene effect estimates and to increased gene discoveries notably among genes that are more genetically constrained. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the integration of functional information across genes improves rare-variant phenotype prediction and gene discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Despite its importance, the process of aging remains poorly understood. Epigenetic dysregulation has been proposed as a key driver of the aging process. Modifications in transcriptional networks and chromatin structure might be central to age-related functional decline. A prevalent feature described during aging is the overall reduction in heterochromatin, specifically marked by the loss of repressive histone modification, Histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). However, the role of H3K9me3 in aging, especially in mammals, remains unclear. Here we show using a novel mouse strain, (TKOc), carrying a triple knockout of three methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 deposition, that the inducible loss of H3K9me3 in adulthood results in premature aging. TKOc mice exhibit reduced lifespan, lower body weight, increased frailty index, multi-organ degeneration, transcriptional changes with significant upregulation of transposable elements, and accelerated epigenetic age. Our data strongly supports the concept that the loss of epigenetic information directly drives the aging process. These findings reveal the importance of epigenetic regulation in aging and suggest that interventions targeting epigenetic modifications could potentially slow down or reverse age-related decline. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of aging will be crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies that can delay the onset of age-associated diseases and preserve human health at old age specially in rapidly aging societies.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Little is known about external factors regulating this process. Here, we identified environmental mechanics as an important regulator of neuronal maturation, and a molecular pathway linking tissue stiffness to this process. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, calcium imaging and immunofluorescence, we found that neurons cultured on stiffer substrates showed a delay in voltage-gated ion channel activity, spontaneous and evoked action potentials, and synapse formation. RNA sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown strategies revealed that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 supresses transthyretin (TTR) expression on stiffer substrates, slowing down synaptic receptor expression and consequently electrical maturation. Stiffening of brain tissue in Xenopus laevis embryos also resulted in a significant delay of synaptic activity in vivo. Our data indicate that environmental stiffness represents a fundamental regulator of neuronal maturation, which is important for the development of normal circuitry in the brain, and potentially for neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Here, we characterized the transcriptomic changes in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC. To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay where female mice chose between a food source or a chamber containing pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviors in both lactating and virgin females. We discovered that ARCAgRP neurons directly inhibit bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA, a population that governs both parenting and satiety. Selective activation of this ARCAgRP to MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviors from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

In this work, we propose HCS-3DX, a next-generation system revolutionising HCS research in 3D imaging and evaluation. HCS-3DX is based on three main components: an automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven micromanipulator for oid selection, an engineered HCS foil multiwell plate for optimised imaging, and an image-based software for single-cell data analysis. The developed system was validated through different experiments with 3D tumour models, including tumour-stroma co-cultures.

As the zebrafish embryo grows into a larva, to improve its heart function, the embryonic myocardial wall transforms into an intricate 3D architecture, composed of an outer compact layer enveloping an inner layer of multicellular trabecular ridges. How these tissue layers acquire their characteristic form suited for their function remains an open question. Here, we find that multiscale mechanochemical coupling and an emergent tissue-scale morphological transition steer functional maturation of the developing zebrafish heart. Single-celled trabecular seeds recruit outer compact layer cells to mature into clonally heterogenous multicellular ridges, thereby amplifying cardiac contractile forces. In response, remaining compact layer cells are stretched, which impedes their further recruitment, thereby constraining trabecular ridge density. Concomitantly, Notch-dependent actomyosin dampening triggers a sharp transition in myocardial tissue area, activating rapid organ growth that expands blood filling capacity. Thus, multiscale self-organizing interactions optimize heart size and contractile efficiency to support embryonic life.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

This is the case of nosocomial bacteria under antibiotic therapy because antibiotics are of ancient natural origin and resistances to them have previously emerged in environmental bacteria. In such cases, the rate of adaptation crucially depends on the acquisition of genes by horizontal transfer of plasmids from distantly related bacteria in different biomes. We hypothesized that such processes should be driven by plasmids amongst the most mobile and evolvable. We confirmed these predictions by showing that plasmid families encoding antibiotic resistance are very mobile, have broad host ranges, while showing higher rates of homologous recombination and faster turnover of gene repertoires than the other plasmids. These characteristics remain outstanding when we remove resistance plasmids from our dataset, suggesting that antibiotic resistance genes are preferentially acquired and carried by plasmid families that are intrinsically very mobile and plastic. Evolvability and mobility facilitate the transfer of antibiotic resistance, and presumably of other phenotypes, across distant taxonomic groups and biomes. Hence, plasmid families, and possibly those of other mobile genetic elements, have differentiated and predictable roles in the spread of novel traits.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

However, indirect protection from infection-acquired immunity and its comparative strength and durability to vaccine-derived indirect protection in the current epidemiologic context of high levels of vaccination, prior infection, and novel variants are not well characterized. Here, we show that both infection-acquired and vaccine-derived immunity independently yield indirect protection to close social contacts with key differences in their strength and waning. Analyzing anonymized data from a system-wide SARS-CoV-2 surveillance program of 177,319 residents across 35 California state prisons from December 2021 to December 2022, we find that vaccine-derived indirect protection against Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection is strongest within three months post-vaccination [30% (95% confidence interval: 20-38%)], whereas infection-acquired immunity provides 39% (25-51%) indirect protection to roommates for 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with moderate indirect protection persisting for over one year. Variant-targeted vaccines (bivalent formulation including Omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5) confer strong indirect protection for at least three months [51% (18-70%)]. These results have important implications for understanding the long-term transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and can guide vaccine policy and public health measures, especially in high-risk environments such as prisons.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053659

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053659

Recently, Holst et al. demonstrated with their program Helixer that the accuracy of ab initio eukaryotic gene prediction can be improved by combining deep learning layers with a separate HMM postprocessor.

ResultsWe present Tiberius, a novel deep learning-based ab initio gene predictor that end-to-end integrates convolutional and long short-term memory layers with a differentiable HMM layer. Tiberius uses a custom gene prediction loss and was trained for prediction in mammalian genomes and evaluated on human and two other genomes. It significantly outperforms existing ab initio methods, achieving F1-scores of 62% at gene level for the human genome, compared to 21% for the next best ab initio method. In de novo mode, Tiberius predicts the exon-intron structure of two out of three human genes without error. Remarkably, even Tiberiuss ab initio accuracy matches that of BRAKER3, which uses RNA-seq data and a protein database. Tiberiuss highly parallelized model is the fastest state-of-the-art gene prediction method, processing the human genome in under 2 hours.

Employing molecular rulers that stabilize ER-mitochondrial distances at 5 nm resolution, and using genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicators targeting the ER lumen and the sub-mitochondrial compartments, we now show that a distance of ~20 nm is optimal for Ca2+ transfer and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism due to enrichment of IP3R at MERCS. In human iPSC-derived astrocytes from PD patients, 20 nm MERCS were specifically reduced which correlated with a reduction of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.

However, many parameters are challenging to estimate from real-world data, and rely on human challenge studies or mass community testing. During Winter 2023/2024, a community cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted across households in England and Scotland. From this survey, questionnaire data and follow-up testing protocols provided valuable data into multiple epidemiological parameters: namely, the duration of positivity, test sensitivity, and the incubation period. Here, Bayesian statistical modelling methods are developed and applied to estimate the underlying parameters. The duration of LFD positivity is found to increase with increasing age, with a mean of 8.55 days (95% CrI: 7.65 days, 9.44 days) in the youngest age group compared to 10.27 days (95% CrI: 9.85 days, 10.71 days) in the oldest age group. Similarly, test sensitivity, as a function of time since symptom onset, decays fastest in the youngest age group, reaching a minimum sensitivity of 0.26 (95% CrI: 0.16, 0.37) compared to 0.54 (95% CrI: 0.46, 0.6). Such patterns are expected since younger individuals experience less severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are likely to clear the virus faster. Combining the duration of positivity and test sensitivity, we estimate the probability of returning a positive test. Close to symptom onset date, this probability is approximately 95%. However, this rapidly drops off, dropping below 5% after 11.3 days (95% CrI: 9.7 days, 13 days) for the youngest age group and 16.2 days (95% CrI: 15.4 days, 17.1 days) for the oldest age group. For the incubation period, there is no clear pattern by age. Across all age groups, the mean incubation period is 2.52 days (95% CrI: 2.42 days, 2.62 days). This is shorter than the most recent estimates for Omicron BA.5, which is in line with earlier research that found replacing variants had shorter incubation periods.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053659

Here, we recorded thousands of neurons in superficial MEC and dorsal CA1 as mice learned to associate two pairs of rewarded locations. We found that during immobility, the MEC neural population frequently represented positions far from the animals location, which we defined as  non-local coding. Cells with spatial firing fields at remote locations drove non-local coding, even as cells representing the current position remained active. While MEC non-local coding has been reported during sharp-wave ripples in downstream CA16, we observed non-local coding more often outside of ripples. In fact, CA1 activity was less coordinated with MEC during non-local coding. We further observed that non-local coding was pertinent to the task, as MEC preferentially represented remote task-relevant locations at appropriate times, while rarely representing task-irrelevant locations. Together, this work raises the possibility that MEC non-local coding could strengthen associations between locations independently from CA1.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Previous archaeogenetic research identified the newcomers as migrants from the Eurasian steppe. However, genome-wide ancient DNA from putative source populations has not been available to test alternative theories of their precise source. We generated genome-wide ancient DNA data for 131 individuals from candidate archaeological contexts in the Circum-Uralic region in present-day Russia.

However, understanding the underlying infection burden (i.e., including undetected asymptomatic/mild infections) and dynamics, particularly since late 2021 when the Omicron variant emerged, is challenging due to the potential for asymptomatic and repeat SARS-CoV-2 infection, changes in testing practices, and changes in disease reporting. Here, we leverage extensive surveillance data available in New York City (NYC) and a comprehensive model-inference system to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 dynamics therein from the pandemic onset in March 2020 to August 2023, and further validate the estimates using independent wastewater surveillance data. The validated model-inference estimates indicate a very high infection burden totaling twice the population size (>5 times documented case count) but decreasing infection-fatality risk (a >10-fold reduction) during the first 3.5 years. The detailed estimates also reveal highly complex variant dynamics and immune landscape, changing virus transmissibility, and higher infection risk during winter in NYC over this time period. These transmission dynamics and drivers, albeit based on data in NYC, may be relevant to other populations and inform future planning to help mitigate the public health burden of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053659

Here, we report measurements of the impact of all single amino acid mutations on ACE2-binding affinity and protein folding and expression in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2.86 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). As with other SARS-CoV-2 variants, we find a plastic and evolvable basis for receptor binding, with many mutations at the ACE2 interface maintaining or even improving ACE2-binding affinity. Despite its large genetic divergence, mutational effects in BA.2.86 have not diverged greatly from those measured in its Omicron BA.2 ancestor. However, we do identify strong positive epistasis among subsequent mutations that have accrued in BA.2.86 descendants. Specifically, the Q493E mutation that decreased ACE2-binding affinity in all previous SARS-CoV-2 backgrounds is reversed in sign to enhance human ACE2-binding affinity when coupled with L455S and F456L in the currently emerging KP.3 variant. Our results point to a modest degree of epistatic drift in mutational effects during recent SARS-CoV-2 evolution but highlight how these small epistatic shifts can have important consequences for the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Because the sexes mix their autosomal genomes each generation, quantifying SDS is not possible using conventional population genetic approaches. Here, we introduce a novel method that exploits subtle sex differences in haplotype frequencies resulting from SDS acting in the current generation. Using data from 300K individuals in the UK Biobank, we estimate the strength of SDS throughout the genome. While only a handful of loci under SDS are individually significant, we uncover polygenic signals of genome-wide SDS for both viability and fecundity. An interesting life-history tradeoff emerges: alleles that increase viability more in one sex increase fecundity more in the other sex. Lastly, we find evidence of SDS on fecundity acting on alleles affecting arm fat-free mass. Taken together, our findings connect the long-standing evidence of SDS acting on human phenotypes with its impact on the genome.

Significance statementSelection often acts differently on females and males, as evidenced by the striking sexual dimorphism found in many taxa. As a result, alleles can have different fitness effects in each sex. Consequences can include higher levels of genetic variation and higher disease burdens in populations. This study introduces a novel method to quantify this sex-differential selection (SDS) and reveals that it acts throughout the human genome. We discovered a life history tradeoff between survival and fecundity in females and males and that SDS on fecundity acts on alleles affecting arm fat-free mass.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

The PAXT connection is an adaptor that recruits the exosome to polyadenylated RNAs in the nucleus, especially transcripts polyadenylated at intronic poly(A) sites. Here we show that PAXT-mediated RNA degradation is induced by the combination of a 5' splice site and a poly(A) junction, but not by either sequence alone. These sequences are bound by U1 snRNP and cleavage/polyadenylation factors, which in turn cooperatively recruit PAXT. As the 5' splice site-poly(A) junction combination is typically not found on correctly processed full-length RNAs, we propose that it functions as a ""nuclear RNA degradation code"" (NRDC). Importantly, disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms that create novel 5' splice sites in 3' untranslated regions can induce aberrant mRNA degradation via the NRDC mechanism. Together our study identified the first NRDC, revealed its recognition mechanism, and characterized its role in human diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

While small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are critical for ribosome biogenesis, the roles of other classes of noncoding RNAs in this process remain largely unknown. Here we performed CRISPRi screens to identify essential long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. This revealed that an alternatively-spliced isoform of lncRNA Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed containing an ultraconserved element (UCE), referred to as CRNDEUCE, is required for RCC cell proliferation. CRNDEUCE localizes to the nucleolus and promotes 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. The UCE of CRNDE functions as an unprocessed C/D box snoRNA that directly interacts with ribosomal RNA precursors. This facilitates delivery of eIF6, a key 60S biogenesis factor, which binds to CRNDEUCE through a sequence element adjacent to the UCE. These findings highlight the functional versatility of snoRNA sequences and expand the known mechanisms through which noncoding RNAs orchestrate ribosome biogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

The ascomycete fungus Colletotrichum graminicola causes maize anthracnose. The disease can result in significant yield losses and is also an important model for genetic studies. We conducted a comprehensive investigation into the evolutionary genomics of C. graminicola using a collection of 212 isolates from 17 countries. Genomic analyses supported the existence of three geographically isolated genetic lineages, with a significant pattern of isolation by distance. We identified two distinct gene flow patterns, driven by short and long-distance dispersion, likely resulting from the natural spread of the pathogen and the exchange of contaminated seeds. We present evidence of genetic introgression between lineages, suggesting a long history of recombination. We identified significant recombination events coalescing at distinct points in time, with the North American lineage displaying evidence of most ancient recombination. Demographic modeling indicated that North America is an intermediate between Brazil, Europe and an ancestral, unsampled source population, hypothesized to be Mesoamerican. Our analyses revealed that the global genomic structure of C. graminicola is shaped by geographic differentiation driven by long-distance migration and a long history of recombination and introgression. We show historical relationships among these lineages, identifying a potential route for fungal spread, with the North American population emerging ancestrally, followed sequentially by the Brazilian and European populations. Our research indicates that the European lineage is more virulent, which has implications for the potential emergence of new outbreaks of maize anthracnose in Europe.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Here, we aim to counter this by collating and sharing the first-hand experiences and insights of autistic children. A total of 136 children (8-14 years of age) self-reported their experiences of being autistic via a semi-structured online questionnaire/video call. Both qualitative and quantitative data was gathered, and inductive thematic analysis used to analyse qualitative responses. Four core themes were identified:  Safety and Security,  Conformity, Fitting in and Masking,  Identity, and  Sensory Sensitivity. The initial theme of safety and security permeated the childrens narratives and overwhelmingly, the children spoke of the need for them to be alert to who in their lives is a safe person and who is not. They were also highly attuned to whether specific places are safe for them, as past experiences appear to have taught them that their safety in everyday places cannot be assumed. Teachers, health and social care professionals, and neurotypical peers were frequently singled out as unsafe people and school as an unsafe place, whilst parents, home, and autistic peers were often referred to as safe. This distinction was also evident in the statistical analysis of the quantitative data, whereby autistic children were significantly more likely to report that it is okay for them to be autistic at home, relative to when they are at school or with their friends/peers. Judging a person as safe was closely linked to that persons understanding of the child and of their autistic experiences, and understanding was important in establishing trust. When trust was established, it appeared possible for trusted people to facilitate a sense of safety for the children even within otherwise unsafe places. A sense of belonging within autistic/neurodivergent communities was positively linked to the core theme of safety and security and to having a positive autistic identity, whilst masking and sensory distress were linked to feeling unsafe and insecure. These first-hand accounts provide valuable insights into autistic childrens lives and demand that we urgently explore how places outside of the family home (including places of education) can be transformed into safe spaces for autistic children.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053659

These ubiquitin C-terminal clippases (UCCs) cleave ubiquitin before the C-terminal diGly motif, thereby truncating the modifier and leaving a remnant on the substrate. By comparing the crystal structures of substrate-bound clippases and a closely related conventional DUB, we identified the factors causing the shift and found them conserved in other clippases, including one highly specific for M1-linked ubiquitin chains. This new enzyme class has great potential as tools to study the ubiquitin system, in particular aspects involving branched chains.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

In primates, this adaptive response is achieved by cerebellar modulation of motor cortical signals, but the nature and timing of this process are unknown. Specifically, cortical correlates of adaptation are encoded already in the pre-movement motor plan, but these early cortical signals could be driven by a cerebellar-to-cortical information flow or evolve independently through intracortical mechanisms. To address this question, we trained monkeys to reach against a viscous force field while blocking cerebellar outflow. During the force field trials, the cerebellar block led to impaired adaptation and a compensatory, re-aiming-like shift in motor cortical preparatory activity. In the null-field conditions, the cerebellar block altered neural preparatory activity by increasing task-representation dimensionality and impeding generalization. A computational model indicated that low-dimensional (cerebellar-like) feedback is sufficient to replicate these findings. We conclude that cerebellar signals carry task structure information that constrains the dimensionality of the cortical preparatory manifold and promotes generalization. In the absence of these signals, cortical mechanisms are harnessed to partially restore adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

To improve disease resistance, it's crucial to accurately annotate nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), which are key components of plant immune systems. This study focuses on refining the NLR repertoire (NLRome) of the Westar cultivar using Resistance gene enrichment sequencing (RenSeq). Initially, only 345 NLR genes were identified in the Westar genome annotation, a figure significantly lower than other canola cultivars. By employing RenSeq, we expanded the annotated NLR genes to 715, including 287 full NLRs and 428 partial NLRs, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the NLR diversity in this cultivar. Our findings reveal crucial genomic regions with previously misannotated NLR genes and identify key integrated domains that may contribute to enhanced disease resistance. This refined NLRome not only advances the fundamental understanding of B. napus genetics but also offers valuable insights for breeding programs and biotechnological applications aimed at improving crop resilience.

This outbreak is associated with the 2.3.4.4b clade of influenza A, and it is as yet unclear what factors have contributed to its spread at the continental scale. In this study we use Bayesian additive regression trees, a machine learning method designed for probabilistic modelling of complex nonlinear phenomena, to construct species distribution models for HPAI presence across Europe. Using these models we identify factors driving the geospatial distribution of cases and project the distribution of risk across Europe. Our models are stratified by time to capture both seasonal changes in risk patterns and shifts in HPAI epidemiology associated with the introduction of the 2.3.4.4b clade. While previous studies have aimed to predict HPAI presence from physical geography, here we explicitly consider the impact of wild bird ecology by including in our model estimates of bird species richness, abundance of specific high-risk bird taxa, and ""species-trait abundance indices"" describing the total abundance of species with high-risk behavioural and/or dietary traits. Our projections point to a shift in concentration of risk towards cold, low-lying regions of coastal northwest Europe associated with 2.3.4.4b, with the margins of uncertainty extending that risk further into central and eastern Europe. In coastal northwest Europe specifically, we predict a persistence of high risk throughout the year. Methodologically, we demonstrate that while the majority of variation in risk can be explained by climate and other aspects of physical geography, the addition of ecological covariates represents a valuable refinement to species distribution models of HPAI.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

To explore the mechanism of TC-NER, we recapitulated this reaction in vitro. When a plasmid containing a site-specific lesion is transcribed in frog egg extract, error-free repair is observed that depends on CSB, CRL4CSA, UVSSA, and ELOF1. Repair also depends on STK19, a factor previously implicated in transcription recovery after UV exposure. A 1.9 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure shows that STK19 joins the TC-NER complex by binding CSA and the RPB1 subunit of Pol II. Furthermore, AlphaFold predicts that STK19 interacts with the XPD subunit of TFIIH, and disrupting this interface impairs cell-free repair. Molecular modeling suggests that STK19 positions TFIIH ahead of Pol II for lesion verification. In summary, our analysis of cell-free TC-NER suggests that STK19 couples RNA polymerase II stalling to downstream repair events.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

We established a set of enhancer-AAV tools that are highly specific for distinct cortical interneuron populations and striatal cholinergic neurons. These enhancers, when used in the context of different effectors, can target (fluorescent proteins), observe activity (GCaMP) and manipulate (opto- or chemo-genetics) specific neuronal subtypes. We also validated our enhancer-AAV tools across species. Thus, we provide the field with a powerful set of tools to study neural circuits and functions and to develop precise and targeted therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Climate change is severely increasing the likelihood of such stresses to occur individually, sequentially, or simultaneously. However, the understanding of acclimation to abiotic stress in crops in general, especially with multiple stresses, is still very limited. Here, we present a comprehensive one month-long molecular and physiological high-throughput profiling of potato (Solanum tuberosum, cv. Desiree) under both single and multiple abiotic stresses, designed to mimic realistic future scenarios. Acclimation time-responses were monitored via daily phenomic analysis and leaf samples were processed for multi-omics spanning from transcriptomics to proteomics and hormonomics. Additionally, critical metabolites of tuber samples were analysed at the end of the period. To facilitate the multi-omics analyses, the dataset was integrated with prior knowledge, which is indispensable for development of high-throughput pipelines in agricultural research. Waterlogging had the most immediate and dramatic effects, with responses similar to drought stress. In addition, we observed distinct stress signatures at multiple molecular levels in response to heat or drought and to a combination of both. In general, there was a downregulation of photosynthesis at different molecular levels, accumulation of minor amino acids and diverse stress induced hormones. Our integrative multi-omics analysis provides global insights into plant stress responses, facilitating improved breeding strategies.

However, while these projects represent a step-change in scale, they retain a traditional structure with centralised funding, participating laboratories and data sharing on publication. Inspired by an open-source project in pure mathematics, we set out to test the feasibility of an alternative structure by running a grassroots, massively collaborative project in computational neuroscience. To do so, we launched a public Git repository, with code for training spiking neural networks to solve a sound localisation task via surrogate gradient descent. We then invited anyone, anywhere to use this code as a springboard for exploring questions of interest to them, and encouraged participants to share their work both asynchro-nously through Git and synchronously at monthly online workshops. At a scientific level, our work investigated how a range of biologically-relevant parameters, from time delays to mem-brane time constants and levels of inhibition, could impact sound localisation in networks of spiking units. At a more macro-level, our project brought together 31 researchers from multiple countries, provided hands-on research experience to early career participants, and opportunities for supervision and teaching to later career participants. Looking ahead, our project provides a glimpse of what open, collaborative science could look like and provides a necessary, tentative step towards it.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) emerged as a promising recurrence predictor, detecting molecular residual disease (MRD). However, spatial information about the tumor and its microenvironment is not directly measured by ctDNA. Deep Learning (DL) can predict prognosis directly from routine histopathology slides.

MethodsWe developed a DL pipeline utilizing vision transformers to predict disease-free survival (DFS) based on histological hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) from patients with resectable stage II-IV CRC. This model was trained on the DACHS cohort (n=1766) and independently validated on the GALAXY cohort (n=1555). Patients were categorized into high- or low-risk groups based on the DL-prediction scores. In the GALAXY cohort, the DL-scores were combined with the four-weeks post-surgery MRD status measured by ctDNA for prognostic stratification.

ResultsIn GALAXY, the DL-model categorized 307 patients as DL high-risk and 1248 patients as DL low-risk (p<0.001; HR 2.60, CI 95% 2.11-3.21). Combining the DL scores with the MRD status significantly stratified both the MRD-positive group into DL high-risk (n=81) and DL low-risk (n=160) (HR 1.58 (CI 95% 1.17-2.11; p=0.002) and the MRD-negative group into DL high-risk (n=226) and DL low-risk (n=1088) (HR 2.37 CI 95% 1.73-3.23; p<0.001). Moreover, MRD-negative patients had significantly longer DFS when predicted as DL high-risk and treated with ACT (HR 0.48, CI 95% 0.27-0.86; p= 0.01), compared to the MRD-negative patients predicted as DL low-risk (HR=1.14, CI 95% 0.8-1.63; p=0.48).

ConclusionDL-based spatial assessment of tumor histopathology slides significantly improves the risk stratification provided by MRD alone. Combining histologic information with ctDNA yields the most powerful predictor for disease recurrence to date, with the potential to improve follow-up, withhold adjuvant chemotherapy in low-risk patients and escalate adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk patients.

Highlights- This study combines MRD status measured by ctDNA with a DL-based risk assessment trained on histological image data to enhance recurrence prediction.
- DL-based spatial assessment of tumor histopathology slides significantly improves the risk stratification provided by MRD alone.
- MRD-negative patients with high DL-based risk had a significantly longer DFS if treated with ACT, compared to MRD-negative and DL low risk patients
- The DL model is fully open-source and publicly available.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053659

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

It is unknown, however, whether high-intensity interval training (HIIT) also evokes an epigenetic muscle memory. This study employed repeated training intervention interspersed with a detraining period to assess epigenetic memory of HIIT.

METHODSTwenty healthy subjects (25{+/-}5yrs) completed two HIIT interventions (training and retraining) lasting 2 months, separated by 3 months of detraining. Measurements at baseline, after training, detraining and retraining included maximal oxygen consumption ([V]O2max). Vastus lateralis biopsies were taken for genome-wide DNA methylation and targeted gene expression analyses. RESULTS: [V]O2max improved during training and retraining (p<0.001) without differences between interventions (p>0.58). Thousands of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) predominantly demonstrated a hypomethylated state after training, retained even after 3-months exercise cessation and into retraining. Five genes; ADAM19, INPP5a, MTHFD1L, CAPN2, SLC16A3 possessed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with retained hypomethylated memory profiles and increased gene expression. The retained hypomethylation during detraining was associated with an enhancement in expression of the same genes even after 3 months of detraining. SLC16A3, INPP5a, CAPN2 are involved in lactate transport and calcium signaling.

CONCLUSIONSDespite similar physiological adaptations between training and retraining, memory profiles were found at epigenetic and gene expression level, characterized by retained hypomethylation and increased gene expression after training into long-term detraining and retraining. These genes were associated with calcium signaling and lactate transport. Whilst significant memory was not observed in physiological parameters, our novel findings indicate that human skeletal muscle possesses an epigenetic memory of HIIT.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Although mis-regulation of RNA turnover is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, how it contributes to cortical development is largely unknown. Here, we profile the RNA stability landscape of the cortex across development and demonstrate that control of stability by the CCR4-NOT complex is essential for corticogenesis in vivo. First, we use SLAM-seq to measure RNA half-lives transcriptome-wide across multiple stages of cortical development. We characterize cis-acting features associated with RNA stability and find that RNAs that are upregulated across development tend to be more stable, while downregulated RNAs are less stable. To probe how disruption of RNA turnover impacts cortical development, we assess developmental requirements of CNOT3, a core component of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Mutations in CNOT3 are associated with human neurodevelopmental disorders, however its role in cortical development is unknown. Conditional knockout of Cnot3 in neural progenitors and their progeny in the developing mouse cortex leads to severe microcephaly due to reduced neuron production and p53-dependent apoptosis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned control of RNA turnover is crucial for brain development.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) efficiently eliminates transcription-blocking lesions (TBLs), thereby safeguarding accurate transcription, preserving correct cellular function and counteracting aging. TC-NER initiation involves the recognition of lesion-stalled Pol II by CSB, which recruits the CRL4CSA E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and UVSSA. TBL-induced ubiquitylation of Pol II at lysine 1268 of the RPB1 subunit by CRL4CSA serves as a critical TC-NER checkpoint, governing Pol II stability and initiating TBL excision by TFIIH recruitment. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of the CRL4CSA E3 ligase activity and TFIIH recruitment remain elusive. Here, we reveal Inactive Serine/Threonine Kinase 19 (STK19) as a novel TC-NER factor, that is essential for correct TBL removal repair and subsequent transcription restart. Cryo-EM studies demonstrate that STK19 is an integral part of the Pol II-TC-NER complex, bridging CSA with UVSSA, RPB1 and downstream DNA. Live-cell imaging and interaction studies show that STK19 stimulates TC-NER complex stability and CRL4CSA activity, resulting in efficient Pol II ubiquitylation and correct UVSSA and TFIIH binding. These findings underscore the crucial role of STK19 as a core component of the TC-NER machinery and its key involvement in the cellular responses to DNA damage that interfere with transcription.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Descending sublineages dominated globally by July 2024, at the time of writing this study. The mechanisms by which highly-divergent viral lineages tend to emerge remain unclear, with the most strongly supported hypothesis being the acquisition of multiple mutations through accelerated evolution in chronically infected individuals, with spread back into the community facilitated by prolonged shedding. We used BA.2.86 as a case study to investigate the evolutionary process behind the emergence of a highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variant. Through fine-scale evolutionary analyses applied to four independently subsampled datasets, we identify over 100 genomes representing evolutionary intermediates occupying the branch in the phylogenetic tree leading to the BA.2.86*/JN.1* clade. Additionally, we detected more than 2,600  hybrid genomes across the evolutionary history of the Omicron-descending BA.2* sub-lineages, displaying a sequential acquisition of BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutation constellations through time. We observe that hybrid strains circulated up to 19 months prior to BA.2.86, denoting cryptic circulation in various countries, with further evidence of early transmission chains. We also found signals of recombination between pre-existing parental lineages, suggesting that this process contributed to the emergence of BA.2.86. Our results suggest that the BA.2.86 lineage emerged sequentially through a complex evolutionary process, rather than via accelerated evolution associated with a single emergence event.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Experiments are expensive and since cells are counted by imaging and aligning a large number of brain sections, they are time-intensive. The resulting datasets tend to be under-sampled with fewer animals than brain regions. As a consequence, these data are a challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We demonstrate that hierarchical Bayesian methods are well suited to these data by presenting a  standard partially-pooled Bayesian model for multi-region cell-count data and applying it to two example datasets. For both datasets the Bayesian model outperformed standard parallel t-tests. Overall, the Bayesian approachs ability to capture nested data and its rigorous handling of uncertainty in under-sampled data can substantially improve inference for cell-count data.

Significance StatementCell-count data is important for studying neuronal activation and gene expression relating to the complex processes in the brain. However, the difficulty and expense of data collection means that such datasets often have small sample sizes. Many routine analyses are not well-suited, especially if there is high variability among animals and surprising outliers in the data. Here we describe a multilevel, mixed effects Bayesian model for these data and show that the Bayesian approach improves inferences compared to the usual approach for two different cell-count datasets with different data characteristics.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, transmission, and intervention strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Previous studies, including our own research, have shown that specific interneuron subtypes are closely associated with particular pyramidal neuron types, forming stereotyped local inhibitory microcircuits. However, the developmental processes that establish these precise networks are not well understood. Here we show that pyramidal neuron types are instrumental in driving the terminal differentiation and maintaining the survival of specific associated interneuron subtypes. In a wild-type cortex, the relative abundance of different interneuron subtypes aligns precisely with the pyramidal neuron types to which they synaptically target. In Fezf2 mutant cortex, characterized by the absence of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons and an expansion of layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, we observed a corresponding decrease in associated layer 5b interneurons and an increase in layer 6 subtypes. Interestingly, these shifts in composition are achieved through mechanisms specific to different interneuron types. While SST interneurons adjust their abundance to the change in pyramidal neuron prevalence through the regulation of programmed cell death, parvalbumin interneurons alter their identity. These findings illustrate two key strategies by which the dynamic interplay between pyramidal neurons and interneurons allows local microcircuits to be sculpted precisely. These insights underscore the precise roles of extrinsic signals from pyramidal cells in the establishment of interneuron diversity and their subsequent integration into local cortical microcircuits.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

While much of the current understanding of P. syringae is centered on interactions with flowering plants, much less is known about infection in evolutionarily divergent non-flowering lineages. Here, we took a comparative evolutionary approach to understand how P. syringae infects distantly related plants. We identify broad host P. syringae isolates causing significant disease in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and the flowering plant Nicotiana benthamiana, which last shared a common ancestor over 500 million years ago. We demonstrate that phytotoxin enriched isolates belonging to the phylogroup 2 clade of the P. syringae species complex are particularly virulent in non-flowering plants, relying on a combination of type-3 secreted effector proteins and the lipopeptide phytotoxin syringomycin. The application of purified syringomycin promotes necrosis in diverse host tissues and activates conserved genes associated with redox regulation and cell death. Toxin-deficient phylogroups normally unable to infect Marchantia thalli exhibit enhanced bacterial growth when supplemented with exogenous syringomycin, further highlighting its role as a host-range defining factor in Pseudomonas. Collectively our research reveals a key role for the lipopeptide syringomycin in promoting Pseudomonas colonization, which works in concert with type-3 effector proteins to antagonize an exceptionally wide spectrum of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war (Physalia) is uniquely suited to dispersal, sailing the ocean surface with a muscular crest. We tested the hypothesis of a single, panmictic Physalia population by sequencing 133 genomes, and found five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence showing strong reproductive isolation despite range overlap. We then scored thousands of citizen-science photos and identified four recognizable morphologies linked to these lineages. Within lineages, we detected regionally endemic subpopulations, connected by winds and currents, and identified individual long-distance dispersal events. We find that, even in these sailing species, genetic variation is highly partitioned geographically across the open ocean.

SummaryThe open ocean is a vast and highly connected environment. The organisms that live there have a significant capacity for dispersal and few geographic boundaries to separate populations. Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war or bluebottle (genus Physalia) is uniquely suited to long-distance travel, using its gas-filled float and muscular crest to catch the wind and sail the sea surface. Physalia are distributed across the globe, and like many pelagic organisms, have been hypothesized to represent a massive, well-mixed population that extends across ocean basins. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing whole genomes of 133 samples collected from waters of over a dozen countries around the globe. Our results revealed five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence indicating strong reproductive isolation, despite regions of range overlap. We combined these data with an independent dataset of thousands of images of Physalia uploaded to the citizen-science website inaturalist.org, which we scored for morphological characters including sail size, tentacle arrangement, and color. From these images, we identified four recognizable morphologies, described their geographical distribution, and linked them to four of the lineages identified with genomic data. We conclude there are at least four species, three of which correspond to species proposed by scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries: P. physalis, P utriculus, and P. megalista, along with one as yet unnamed species Physalia sp. from the Tasman Sea. Within each species, we observe significant population structure, with evidence of persistent subpopulations at a regional scale, as well as evidence for individual long-distance dispersal events. Our findings indicate that, instead of one well-mixed, cosmopolitan species, there are in fact multiple Physalia species with distinct but overlapping ranges, each made up of regionally endemic subpopulations that are connected by major ocean currents and wind patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

How the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm affect spindle architecture and size remains largely unknown. Using quantitative biochemistry in combination with adaptive feedback microscopy, we investigated mitotic cell and spindle morphology during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells. While tubulin biochemistry and microtubule dynamics remained unchanged, spindles changed their scaling behaviour: in differentiating cells, spindles were significantly smaller than those in equally-sized undifferentiated stem cells. Integrating quantitative phase imaging, biophysical perturbations and theory, we found that as cells differentiated, their cytoplasm became more dilute. The concomitant decrease in free tubulin activated CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein) to enhance the centrosomal nucleation capacity. As a consequence, in differentiating cells, microtubule mass shifted towards spindle poles at the expense of the spindle bulk, explaining the differentiation-associated switch in spindle architecture. This study shows that cell state-specific cytoplasmic density tunes mitotic spindle architecture. Thus, we reveal physical properties of the cytoplasm as a major determinant in organelle size control.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Here, we reveal that recoded Escherichia coli lacking 18,214 serine codons and two tRNASer can express wild-type antibiotic resistance genes and escape up to seven orders of magnitude faster than expected. We show a two-step escape process whereby recoded cells mistranslate antibiotic resistance genes to survive until modified or mutated tRNAs reintroduce serine into unassigned codons. We developed genetic-code-sensitive kill switches that sense serine incorporation and prevent cellular escape while preserving encoding of three distinct non-standard amino acids. This work lays the foundation for the long-term controlled function of cells that incorporate new chemistries, with implications for the design, use, and biosafety of synthetic genomes in clinical and environmental applications where physical containment is insufficient.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus that has not previously been associated with widespread infection in cattle. As such, cattle are an extremely under-studied domestic IAV host species. IAV receptors on host cells are sialic acids (SAs) that are bound to galactose in either an 2,3 or 2,6 linkage. Human IAVs preferentially bind SA-2,6 (human receptor), whereas avian IAVs have a preference for 2,3 (avian receptor). The avian receptor can further be divided into two receptors: IAVs isolated from chickens generally bind more tightly to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,4 (chicken receptor), whereas IAVs isolated from duck to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,3 (duck receptor). We found all receptors were expressed, to a different degree, in the mammary gland, respiratory tract, and cerebrum of beef and/or dairy cattle. The duck and human IAV receptors were widely expressed in the bovine mammary gland, whereas the chicken receptor dominated the respiratory tract. In general, only a low expression of IAV receptors was observed in the neurons of the cerebrum. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel for novel IAV generation.

The lack of a comprehensive understanding on the biology of the disease is paralleled by its dismal survival rates (5-20%). To overcome this challenge, we first identified and prioritized urgently needed resources for clinicians and researchers. Thus, we established genome-wide single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk proteomic data of in vitro and in vivo-generated knockdown models of the pathognomonic DSRCT fusion oncoprotein (EWSR1::WT1) and combined them with an original systems-biology-based pipeline including patient data and the largest histology collection of DSRCTs and morphological mimics available to date. These novel tools were enriched with curated public datasets including patient- and cell line-derived ChIP-seq, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq studies resulting in a multi-model and multi-omic toolbox for discovery analyses. As a proof of concept, our approach revealed the alpha-2/delta subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, CACNA2D2, as a highly overexpressed, super-enhancer driven, direct target of EWSR1::WT1. Single-cell and bulk-level analyses of patient samples and xenografted cell lines highlighted CACNA2D2 as a critical component of our newly established EWSR1::WT1 oncogenic signature, that can be employed to robustly identify DSRCT in reference sets. Finally, we show that CACNA2D2 is a highly sensitive and specific single biomarker for fast, simple, and cost-efficient diagnosis of DSRCT. Collectively, we establish a large-scale multi-omics dataset for this devastating disease and provide a blueprint of how such toolbox can be used to identify new and clinically relevant diagnostic markers, which may significantly reduce misdiagnoses, and thus improve patient care.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

During immobility, hippocampal replay sequences depict spatial paths related to the animals past experience or predicted future13. By recording from large ensembles of hippocampal place cells14 in combination with optogenetic manipulation of cortical input in freely behaving rats, we show here that the selection of hippocampal replay is governed by a novel self-avoidance principle. Following movement cessation, replay of the animals past path is strongly avoided, while replay of the future path predominates. Moreover, when the past and future paths overlap, early replays avoid both and depict entirely different trajectories. Further, replays avoid self-repetition, on a shorter timescale compared to the avoidance of previous behavioral trajectories. Eventually, several seconds into the stopping period, replay of the past trajectory dominates. This temporal organization contrasts with established and recent predictions9,10,15,16 but is well-recapitulated by a symmetry-breaking attractor model of sequence generation in which individual neurons adapt their firing rates over time26-35. However, while the model is sufficient to produce avoidance of recently traversed or reactivated paths, it requires an additional excitatory input into recently activated cells to produce the later window of past-dominance. We performed optogenetic perturbations to demonstrate that this input is provided by medial entorhinal cortex, revealing its role in maintaining a memory of past experience that biases hippocampal replay.

Here, we introduce RWRtoolkit, a multiplex generation, exploration, and statistical package built for R and command line users. RWRtoolkit enables the efficient exploration of large and highly complex biological networks generated from custom experimental data and/or from publicly available datasets, and is species agnostic. A range of functions can be used to find topological distances between biological entities, determine relationships within sets of interest, search for topological context around sets of interest, and statistically evaluate the strength of relationships within and between sets. The command-line interface is designed for parallelisation on high performance cluster systems, which enables high throughput analysis such as permutation testing. Several tools in the package have also been made available for use in reproducible workflows via the KBase web application.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Their genomes encode extensive repertoires of secreted effector proteins that suppress host immunity. Here, we revised and analyzed the candidate secreted effector protein (CSEP) effectome of the barley powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria hordei (Bh) and identified seven CSEPs that are broadly conserved in powdery mildew fungal species, rendering them core effectors of these phytopathogens. We show that one of these, CSEP0214, interacts with the barley VPS18 protein, a core component of the CORVET and HOPS endosomal tethering complexes, mediating fusions of early endosomes and multivesicular bodies with the central vacuole, respectively. Overexpression of CSEP0214 and knockdown of either VPS18, HOPS-specific VPS41 or CORVET-specific VPS8 caused a block of the vacuolar pathway and the accumulation of the fluorescent vacuolar marker protein (SP)-RFP-AFVY in the endoplasmic reticulum. Co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that CSEP0214 blocks the interaction of VPS18 and VPS16, which are both core components of CORVET as well as HOPS. Additionally, expression of CSEP0214 blocked the hypersensitive cell death response associated with resistance gene-mediated immunity in barley, indicating that endomembrane traffic is required for this process. It also prevented callose deposition in cell wall appositions at attack sites and encasements of fungal infection structures. Our results indicate that this powdery mildew core effector is an essential immunity suppressor.

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently replicate and infect chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates PB2-627V maintains stable functionality across the two distinct hosts. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations.

MethodsA large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053659

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1722118053659

Mobile Integrons (MI) are borne on plasmids, acting as a vehicle for hundreds of antimicrobial resistance genes among key pathogens. These elements also carry gene cassettes of unknown function (gcus) whose role and adaptive value remains unexplored. Recent years have witnessed the discovery of a myriad defence systems against bacteriophages, highlighting that viral infection is a major selective pressure for bacteria. We hence sought to explore if gcus could encode phage defence systems. Using the INTEGRALL database, we established a collection of 129 gcus in pMBA, a vector where cassettes are established as part of a class 1 integron. PADLOC and DefenseFinder predicted four phage defence systems in this collection, comprising Lamassu, CBASS and two ABI (abortive infection) systems. We experimentally challenged all cassettes with phages and found nine additional candidates that were not detected in silico. We have characterized in depth the 13 gcus against a panel of phages in Escherichia coli confirming their role as phage defence integron cassettes (PICs). We used recombination assays to verify that all systems are bona fide integron cassettes and are therefore mobile. We show that PICs confer resistance in other clinically relevant species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several PICs also limit prophage activation, providing protection at the population-level. Given the stockpiling capacity of integrons, we explored the additivity of phenotypes and found that integrons with two PICs confer multiphage-resistance. Additionally, when combined with antimicrobial resistance genes, integrons confer simultaneously drug and phage resistance. Crucially, we also show that the position of a pic in the array can strongly decrease its cost. Our results prove a role of integrons in phage defence, acting as highly mobile, low-cost defence islands. This has important implications in the spread of defence systems, and on the future of phage therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

They form superhelical structures around which DNA is wrapped. Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1722118053659
