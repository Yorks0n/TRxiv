Despite its potential, LSFM has fragmented into multiple variants, each narrowly optimized for specific samples or imaging regimes, limiting its broad applicability. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the multi-immersion oblique plane microscope (miOPM), an adaptable LSFM platform for high-resolution imaging ranging from subcellular dynamics to whole organisms and cleared tissues. miOPM uniquely supports seamless interchangeability of oil, water, and air objectives, and maintains diffraction limited performance across a refractive index range of 1.33 - 1.51. It is compatible with standard sample mounting, current clearing protocols and high-throughput 3D imaging. We leverage miOPM to image diverse biological specimens at multiple spatial scales. By greatly expanding the adaptability and ease of use of LSFM, miOPM is poised to democratize advanced three-dimensional imaging.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM133522;R35GM119768;R35GM137894;RM1GM145399;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00372qc85"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01EB035538;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268072;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2MH119423;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Because of their intracellular nature, the establishment of these interactions requires tight regulation by the host plants. In particular, three genes - SYMRK, CCaMK and CYCLOPS - form the core of an ancestral common symbiosis pathway (CSP) for intracellular symbioses, and are conserved since the most recent common ancestor of land plants (Radhakrishnan et al. 2020; Delaux et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2010; Parniske 2008). Here, we describe EPP1 as a fourth gene committed to the CSP. Among land plants, EPP1 is conserved only in species able to associate with at least one type of intracellular symbiont. We found that loss-of-function epp1 mutants or EPP1 knock-down lines in four clades of land plants - legumes, Solanaceae, monocots and bryophytes - are all impaired in their ability to associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We discovered that the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like SYMRK phosphorylates EPP1 on a conserved serine residue and that this phosphorylation is essential for symbiosis. Using a gain-of-function approach, we demonstrate that EPP1 is upstream of the nuclear kinase CCaMK. We propose that EPP1 is an ancestral component of the essential pathway that has regulated plant symbiosis for half a billion years.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-LABX-41;ANR-18-EURE-0019;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPP1172165;""},{""name"":""Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037wke960"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPP1172165;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001675;""},{""name"":""European Union's Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101105838;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#DE-SC0018247;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Agriculture"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01na82s61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#WIS05052;""},{""name"":""Secretaría de Ciencia, Humanidades, Tecnología e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CBF-2025-I-12;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

We have recently shown that mesothelin-targeting CAR T cells co-transduced with cytokine-binding synthetic velocity receptors (VRs, referred to as CAR TV cells) demonstrate increased motility, improved infiltration in solid primary tumors, and lead to a better anti-tumor effect compared to CAR T cells that do not express VRs. However, it is metastasis that causes the vast majority of cancer related deaths and is difficult to target clinically, indicating an urgent unmet need. We show that these CAR T cells engineered to be hyper-migratory using VRs are highly effective against liver metastasis of ovarian cancer along different stages of the metastatic cascade. Mesothelin-targeting CAR TV cells expressing synthetic or native receptors responsive to the cytokine Interleukin-5 improved the survival of mice bearing an extremely high or  terminal level of metastatic burden compared to CAR T cells that did not express VRs. Against newly established metastatic lesions and lesions undergoing metastatic outgrowth, CAR TV cells showed a robust anti-cancer effect resulting in an improved prognosis compared to control CAR T cells. Histopathological assessments showed a substantial reduction of metastasis number and lesion size with CAR TV treatment, concomitant with increased immune cell infiltration in the metastatic regions. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of high-motility CAR T cells in a metastatic setting and extends their scope to the treatment of metastasis of solid tumors.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA143868;U54AR081774;U54CA268083;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01AG060903;P30CA006973;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759874963801

Despite this, there is no standard way of formulating ion channel models, making it challenging to relate models to one another and experimental data. Here, we revive the idea of a standard model for ion channels based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation, and apply it to a recently curated database of ion channel models. We demonstrate that this standard formulation, which we refer to as an omnimodel, accurately fits the majority of voltage-gated models in the database (over 3,000 models). It produces similar, if not identical, responses to voltage-clamp protocols in simulations where the ion channel omnimodels were used. Importantly, the standard formalism enables easy comparison of models based on parameter settings. It can also be used to make new observations about the space of ion channel kinetics found in neurons. Furthermore, it facilitates the inference of ion channel parameters from the responses to standard protocols. We provide an interactive platform to compare and select channel models, and encourage the community to use this standard formulation whenever possible, to facilitate understanding and comparison among models.","[{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UKRI-BBSRC BB/N019512/1;""},{""name"":""German Research Foundation (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2064 – Project number 390727645;""},{""name"":""CRC ``Robust Vision''."",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1233;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SynapSeek;DeepCoMechTome;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Gene co-expression networks revealed that stress-response hubs were largely lineage-specific, yet converged in function through the co-option of ancient gene families. Phylogenomic and machine learning analyses supported a dominant role for early-evolving genes, enriched in stress-related functions, with extensive gene loss at terrestrialisation nodes.

Mathematical modeling provides a powerful approach to bridge this gap by linking viral dynamics with immune interactions. In this work, we develop a mechanistic within-host model, formulated in a system of coupled ordinary and delayed differential equations, to investigate the contributions of NK cell activity, interferon signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines to viral clearance and disease outcome. Model parameters are estimated from experimental data, and computational simulations are used to explore how dysregulated NK responses and cytokine feedback loops may drive divergent clinical outcomes. Local sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential parameters shaping host-pathogen dynamics, highlighting potential control points for intervention. In addition, knockdown simulations are performed to mimic potential therapeutic interventions, allowing us to evaluate their advantages and limitations in silico. These findings provide mechanistic insights into COVID-19 immune dynamics and offer a foundation for guiding the design of future treatment strategies.

During heat shock, misfolded proteins accumulate in its granular component (GC), but whether this is passive or regulated has been unclear. We show that the ubiquitin ligase CHIP remodels the nucleolus into a reversible protein quality control (PQC) compartment by diverting HSP70 from refolding toward sequestration and transiently suppressing rRNA synthesis. This process requires the segregase VCP, which mediates ubiquitinated substrate flux and couples nucleolar PQC with nuclear and ER stress responses. Functional genomics identify NOL6 and WDR55 as intrinsic gatekeepers with opposing effects on sequestration. We further define three structural states - free-flow, peripheral, and sealed - that encode PQC capacity and recovery potential. Thus, nucleolar proteostasis is revealed as an actively regulated continuum, linking chaperones, ubiquitination, and ribosome biogenesis with global stress adaptation.","[{""name"":""National Science Centre"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ha2q922"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2021/42/E/NZ1/00190;2018/30/E/NZ7/00614;2019/34/H/NZ3/00691;""},{""name"":""Foundation for Polish Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/048zd9m77"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""POIR.04.04.00-00-5EAB/18-00;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Why perturbations in ER morphology manifest specifically in neurons remains unknown. Here, by coupling visualisation of global sub-Hz firing bursts to ER ultrastructural manipulations in hiPSC-derived cortical neurons, alongside physical simulations, we establish a key ER structure-function principle: neuronal ER architecture dictates Ca2+ replenishment speed. Altering ER structure hinders network ER luminal connectivity and Ca2+ propagation from refill points at plasma membrane contact sites, impairing the ER's capability to supply repetitive Ca2+ bursts.

EPP1 is recruited to the activated SYMRK receptor, where it is phosphorylated on a key serine residue, an event essential and sufficient to propagate symbiotic signaling. We provide structural and functional validation of the SYMRK-EPP1 signaling complex and demonstrate that EPP1 is required for root nodule formation.

Upon cell entry, translation of the virus genome is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Despite early identification of the poliovirus IRES, structure determination has been hampered by the flexibility and complexity of the RNA (~450 nt, five structured domains), the requirement for almost all of the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and additional dependency on PCBP2 for trans-activation. As a result, there is little mechanistic information on how enterovirus Type 1 IRESs recruit and direct translational machinery. To address this, here we reconstitute human translation initiation on a model poliovirus IRES and examine 48S complexes by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Our structures reveal a novel set of interactions between the IRES and the translation machinery. Domain IVc contacts uS19 and uS13 on the small ribosomal subunit, and the conserved apical GNRA tetraloop interacts directly with the initiator tRNA during start-codon recognition. We demonstrate that disruption of these contacts causes defects in IRES-driven translation and virus replication. Together, our results define the structural and molecular basis for translation initiation on the Type 1 IRES, and highlight the potential for RNA-RNA tertiary interactions as new targets for antiviral therapeutics.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/Z515668/1;BB/M011151/1;BBS/E/PI/230002A;BBS/E/PI/23NB0003;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/T000376/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220620/Z/20/Z;202471/Z/16/A;221818/Z/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

G{gamma}30A is essential for broadening responses to long-chain acids, acting with Gs, G{beta}13F, adenylate cyclase Ac13E and the Cngl channel.

Importantly, loss of Cirl also narrows Ir64a-DC4 tuning properties. Homologous neurons in Drosophila sechellia naturally exhibit narrow acid tuning, despite functional conservation of Ir64a; these differences correlate instead with lower expression of metabotropic components.

Particularly, few biologically relevant substrates of these proteases have been identified. Huanglongbing (HLB) has been a major threat to the citrus industry worldwide. The HLB-associated bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), was previously shown to deploy an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) to promote disease in citrus. In this study, we identified an outer membrane protein (OMP) of Las, LasOMP1, as a substrate of the citrus PLCP CsRD21a. LasOMP1 is one of the most highly expressed genes in Las. CsRD21a cleaves LasOMP1 and produces cleaved peptide products, which could be detected in vitro and in HLB-diseased citrus plants. We found that CsRD21a targets the N-terminal portion of LasOMP1, potentially at an extracellular loop region. Importantly, transgenic sweet orange overexpressing CsRD21a showed reduced Las titers and delayed disease symptoms, highlighting that engineering this protease is a promising strategy to enhance HLB resistance in citrus.

However, standard treatments to restore inhibition have limited efficacy, suggesting the existence of additional pathological mechanisms. Here, we use hiPSC-derived neuronal networks containing both excitatory and inhibitory neurons to show that excessive bursting activity in DS cultures is driven by excitatory neurons. This rise in bursting frequency is caused by the increased expression of HCN1 ""pacemaker"" channels in excitatory neurons, and bursting activity can be normalised using a channel blocker.

We show that monkeys responded to dogs with a two-pronged behaviour: they emitted alarm calls, and became more vigilant and displayed aggressive behaviours towards the dogs. While their movement highlighted risk-prone behaviour, they appeared to have mapped and planned for risk, as they reacted more strongly when risk was unexpected. The response intensity was further modulated by risk labels typically encountered in their natural environment, but not by labels uniquely associated with dogs. This highlights that vervet monkeys responded with ingrained behaviour to this evolutionarily new threat, anticipating risk based on long-term spatial memory, but failed to integrate evolutionarily new information.

The pathogenesis remains poorly understood, particularly how UBA1 mutations perturb myeloid function. Here, we combine a genetically engineered THP1 monocytic model with ex vivo analyses of blood and tissue samples from VEXAS patients to investigate the consequences of the canonical UBA1M41V mutation. We show that UBA1 mutated monocytes exhibit TNF induced cell death, characterized by RIPK1 phosphorylation, and MLKL- and caspase-8 mediated cell death. This is associated with defective transcriptional induction of NF{kappa}B target genes and reduced cFLIP(L) expression in response to TNF. Monocytes also display blunted cytokine responses to multiple Toll like receptor (TLR) agonists despite preserved TLR expression, linked to an impaired NF{kappa}B response. UBA1M41V derived macrophages exhibit an inflammatory transcriptional profile and increased secretion of chemokines that promote monocyte recruitment. We demonstrate that these UBA1M41V macrophages display impaired clearance of apoptotic bodies due to lysosomal dysfunction. Together, these findings reveal a pathogenic axis in VEXAS syndrome linking UBA1 loss of function and defective ubiquitination to RIPK1 mediated inflammatory cell death, impaired antimicrobial signaling, and defective resolution mechanisms.

Although gene expression-based stratification has advanced our understanding of molecular subtypes, it often overlooks the regulatory mechanisms driving tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. These mechanisms are governed by gene regulatory networks - complex systems of transcription factors and other regulators that control gene expression. To investigate regulatory heterogeneity at the patient level, we inferred individual gene regulatory networks for over 9,000 tumors across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas enabling a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of inter-patient regulatory variation. Our analysis uncovered novel regulatory subtypes and revealed recurrent dysregulation of the PD-1 signaling pathway in 23 cancer types.

These conserved proteins are also found in many phages, including marine cyanophages that infect the ecologically important marine cyanobacteria. However, their role in phage infection is not known. Cyanophages also carry many small genes lacking homology to known functional domains. Whether these have a functional role or not remains unknown. Here, we explore the distribution and role of a cyanophage thioredoxin (trxA), and that of a small gene directly downstream of it (g26), in phage infection. For this we used the T7-like cyanophage, Syn5, which infects an open-ocean marine Synechococcus strain, WH8109. We found that thioredoxin genes are common in phage genomes, including in cyanophages. The g26 gene, however, is restricted in it distribution to the cyanophages. The cyanophage thioredoxin is catalytically active and it increases phage DNA replication, progeny production and competitive fitness. It also negatively impacts host growth. The g26 gene product is translationally coupled to, and thus dependent on, translation of the thioredoxin gene. This gene itself significantly increases phage virulence and fitness, yet reduces burst size. Our findings demonstrate that cyanophage thioredoxins impact phage fitness and infection physiology and that small viral genes with no homology to known genes can play an important role in the infection process. These findings provide insights into the importance of unusual genes in phage genomes and show that they are likely to play an important role in the interactions between abundant cyanobacteria and cyanophages in ocean ecosystems.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

A recent study identified an association between rs562556 within PCSK9 and breast cancer survival (BCS). It was suggested that PCSK9 inhibition might allow for early intervention strategies to prevent metastasizing breast cancer. Here, we attempt to replicate these findings by using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics in three 2-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) approaches. Methods: We used publicly available GWAS summary statistics for PCSK9 and BCS from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (N=99,217), and performed SNP association tests with BCS in the FinnGen study (N=4,648). First, we tested the MR-ratio using only the reported SNP rs562556, then tested the genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition using the MR inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach, and finally adjusted for indirect effects of the lipid metabolism using multivariable MR (MVMR-IVW). Coronary artery disease and parental longevity were chosen as positive control outcomes. Results: We found no significant association between PCSK9 and BCS in neither the MR-ratio, MR-IVW nor MVMR-IVW approach. The positive controls were significant throughout. Conclusion: A significant positive effect of PCSK9 on BCS could only be reproduced when using the outcome data from the recent study, but not when using independent, larger GWASs. Impact: Potential reasons for the discrepant results are different genetic models, sample selection criteria, and the time-variability of Hazard Ratio estimates. They should be explored before considering PCSK9 a therapeutic target in BC patients.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759874963801

However, current approaches often require substantial screening from which hits require further affinity maturation. Methods for experimentally improving designed proteins and exploring their sequence-affinity landscapes could therefore streamline the development of high-affinity binders and inform future design strategies. Here, we use OrthoRep, a system for continuous hypermutation in vivo, to drive the evolution of computationally designed mini protein binders (""minibinders"") that target a mammalian receptor. Despite their small sizes (59-72 amino acids), we successfully affinity matured multiple minibinders through strong selection for improved binding and also sampled new regions of minibinder fitness landscapes through extensive neutral drift. One evolved minibinder variant was used to construct a combinatorially complete sequence-affinity map for its six affinity increasing mutations, which revealed nearly full additivity in their contributions to binding. Another minibinder was subjected to both deep mutational scanning and extensive evolution under weak selection, resulting in an evolutionarily diverged collection of binder sequences that revealed non-additive relationships among mutations. Our results highlight that the affinity of computationally designed binders can be rapidly increased through evolution and provide a scalable approach for the evolutionary exploration and subsequent mapping of sequence-affinity landscapes. We suggest that this work will complement protein binder design both as a reliable experimental optimization process and as a vehicle for generating new training data.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

This study uncovers the role of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) XIST, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in driving female-specific AD pathology. Analyses of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from human AD cortical tissues and in vitro AD models reveal a notable increase and abnormal cytoplasmic localization of XIST, a phenomenon not previously observed in neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, altered EZH2 levels dampen the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) on the inactive X chromosome, disrupting epigenetic silencing. This dysregulation impacts the RNA export factor subunit THOC2, whose levels are also elevated in AD. Cytoplasmic XIST acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by binding to miR-186-5p, rescuing EZH2 and THOC2 transcripts. This creates a positive feedback loop that sustains both nuclear epigenetic machinery and cytoplasmic post-transcriptional regulation by XIST. The miR-186/EZH2/THOC2/XIST axis offers a molecular framework for understanding the female-biased vulnerability in AD, linking XIST-driven epigenetic changes with nuclear RNA export pathways via cytoplasmic XIST. Disrupted EZH2-XIST interaction reduces H3K27me3 marks on the inactive X chromosome, while increased THOC2 promotes THOC2 (TREX) binding to XIST, maintaining the harmful feedback. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism through which XIST gets recruited to the nuclear export pathways in AD. These results position XIST as a key epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulator in female AD pathophysiology and suggest it could be a target for sex-specific therapeutic interventions.","[{""name"":""Department of Atomic Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02m388s04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RSI 4002;""},{""name"":""Department of Science and Technology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0101xrq71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRG/2021/000678;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Here, we generate cell type-specific translatomes of the Caenorhabditis elegans intestine during fasting and refeeding using discrete promoters for the anterior quartet of intestinal cells (INT1) and the remaining 8 pairs of intestinal cells (INT2-9). We found that the anterior-most INT1 cells are a translationally distinct intestinal sub-compartment that is particularly enriched for immune- and stress-response genes. Functional assays using novel INT1-specific genes emerging from this study reveal that these specialized cells play a previously unappreciated role in pathogen avoidance and organismal survival. A second critical function of INT1 cells is their role in sensing and responding to the contents of the gut lumen. We show that luminal pyruvate is the key signal linking bacterial nutrients in the gut, to secretion of the gut insulin antagonist INS-7. These findings establish INT1 as sentinel enteroendocrine cells that integrate metabolic and immune cues to couple food status with immune and endocrine responses.

However, the pathways through which the gut conveys adverse or unpleasant information to the brain are still not well understood. In this study, we identify an aversive gut-brain axis in Drosophila melanogaster that detects toxin-induced gut damage and triggers both innate and learned anticipatory emesis (vomiting). After toxin ingestion, reactive oxygen species are produced by midgut enterocytes and detected by the transient receptor potential channel TrpA1 on nearby enteroendocrine cells. This sensing stimulates the release of neuropeptides from enteroendocrine cells, likely representing the gastric malaise flies experience after eating. We show that these neuropeptides act on specific serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the brain. These neurons interact with each other and signal to the downstream memory-related mushroom bodies to promote emesis. This circuit not only drives an immediate emetic response but also represents a malaise-driven aversive signal. The signal manifests as the persistent activity of dopaminergic neurons, which reinforces aversive valence to odor cues in the mushroom bodies. Thus, the flies learn that a specific odor predicts the presence of a toxin in food and exhibit anticipatory emesis upon re-exposure to the same odor. Taken together, we have identified an interoceptive signaling pathway that may be conserved for detecting harmful gut conditions and for remembering how to avoid them. Our work offers a mechanistic framework for studying aversive gut-brain communication involved in feeding, metabolism, depression, brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases.","[{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board (now ANRF)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRG/2019/005587;SB/S2/RJN-048/2017;""},{""name"":""Pratiksha Trust Extra-Mural Support for Transformational Aging Brain Research (EMSTAR)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMSTAR/2023/SL03;""},{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tjsyq23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BT/PR51490/MED/ 22/361/2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Chronic neuroinflammation and disruption of the gut-brain axis are implicated as shared pathological drivers, but the precise molecular mechanisms connecting these conditions remain elusive. We hypothesized that a common microRNA (miRNA)-mediated inflammatory profile underlies this clinical triad, representing a point of pathological convergence. Methods: We analyzed the expression of a panel of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated miRNAs, key inflammatory markers, and glial response in postmortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) from patients with PD, DD, and matched healthy controls. To investigate causality and gut-brain axis involvement, two mouse models were used: (i) PD-associated -synucleinopathy was induced in dorsal raphe serotonin (5-HT) neurons; and (ii) DD-like based on corticosterone (CORT)-induced stress. Mice were assessed for depressive-like behaviors and GI dysmotility, and their brain (medial prefrontal cortex and caudate-putamen) and ileum tissues were analyzed for the same molecular markers. Results: We identified a conserved miRNA pattern in the brains of both PD and DD patients, characterized by the significant downregulation of miR-199a-5p and miR-219a-5p and the upregulation of miR-200a-3p. This dysregulation was strongly associated with a pro-inflammatory state, as evidenced by increased expression of TNF, IFN-{gamma}, and NF{kappa}B1, as well as changes in the glial response. Mice with -synucleinopathy in the 5-HT system exhibited a depression-like phenotype and reduced intestinal motility, accompanied by increased Iba1 and GFAP signal. Comparable effects were observed in mice subjected to CORT-induced stress. Notably, the same pattern of miRNAs and inflammatory cytokines observed in the human brain was replicated in the brain and ileum of DD-PD-like mice, providing direct evidence of a parallel pathological process spanning the gut-brain axis. Conclusion: This study identifies a specific miRNA-inflammatory axis as a common molecular mechanism connecting the pathophysiology of PD, DD, and gut dysfunction. This pattern represents a critical point of convergence that drives a shared, bidirectional inflammatory cascade along the gut-brain axis. Targeting this miRNA triad could provide a new therapeutic approach for addressing the motor, psychiatric, and GI symptoms of these interconnected disorders simultaneously.","[{""name"":""MCIU/AEI/FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2022-141700OB-I00;""},{""name"":""Fundació La Marató TV3"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""202207;""},{""name"":""AGAUR, Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona, ES"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2021-SGR-01358;""},{""name"":""Basque Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00pz2fp31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IT1512/22;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Despite this conservation, TBP function diverges across species. In yeast, TBP is required for all three RNA Pols, whereas in mammals, it is essential only for RNA Pol III, but not RNA Pol I or II. To examine the evolutionary divergence of TBP homologs in different species, we determined the ability of murine TBP and its paralogs to complement endogenous TBP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite their highly conserved DNA-binding domains, murine TBP homologs were unable to fully rescue the lethality caused by TBP inactivation in yeast. This incomplete complementation correlates with a failure to fully support binding by RNA Pols II and III. Furthermore, we show that the divergent N- terminal domain (NTD) of TBP contributes to species-specific activity and modulates RNA Pol II binding changes in stress-induced response. Lastly, we demonstrate a negative correlation between the length of the intrinsically disordered NTD of TBP family proteins and the gene density in different species, suggesting that the NTD may have contributed to increasingly complex gene regulation during evolution.","[{""name"":""Canadian Institutes of Health Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gavpb45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PJT-191938;PJT-162289;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2020-06106;""},{""name"":""Canada Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0517h6h17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRC-RS 2021-00294;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

We further demonstrate that the fat pad atrophy is associated with influx of a CCR2-independent, lipid metabolising, macrophage population. Macrophage depletion ameliorates fat pad atrophy, and lymph node expansion, downstream of inflamed sites. Our data therefore identify peripheral inflammation as an antigen-independent trigger of downstream fat pad and lymph node remodelling and contributes to the release of essential nutrients to drive the energetic requirements of the adaptive immune response.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""217093/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/V01972/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

To address this, we introduce the GA4GH refget Sequence Collections (seqcol) standard. Refget seqcol is a framework for unambiguous representation, retrieval, and comparison of sequence collections such as reference genomes and transcriptomes. The seqcol standard comprises four components: a structured data schema, a canonical encoding algorithm that produces content-based, globally unique identifiers, a retrieval API, and a comparison protocol. This standard enables precise identification of sequence collections, even across decentralized or private systems, and allows compatibility assessments beyond exact identity, such as order-relaxed matches or shared coordinate systems. We applied the refget seqcol standard to 60 human and 36 mouse reference genomes sourced from major providers. Using digest-based comparisons, we quantified levels of similarity across attributes including sequence names, lengths, coordinate systems, and actual sequence content. Our analysis revealed some consistent subsets of sequences or coordinate systems, as well as substantial incompatibility among references and duplicate references under different names. To support adoption of refget seqcol, we provide a Python package implementing the full standard, a web API, and a comparison interface allowing users to assess local references against a curated database. This work offers a scalable, reproducible solution to the reference genome compatibility crisis, enabling improved transparency, reuse, and integration in genomic analyses. Refget seqcol enhances interoperability across tools and datasets, making genomic research more robust and reproducible.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35-GM128636;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01-HG012558;U24-HG011025;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_PC_19204;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220544/Z/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Research Council of Norway"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""322 392;322 392;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Laboratory"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03mstc592"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Some alterations correlated more closely with specific mutations (e.g., SF3B1, TP53) than clinical risk scores (IPSS-M).

Leopards (Panthera pardus), a widely distributed generalist species, provide an ideal case for studying the role of the environment. The population dynamics of African and Asian leopards differ dramatically, with near panmixia in Africa versus a strong structure and eight subspecies in Asia. Fossil records show that a population in Europe disappeared after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), further pointing to complex range dynamics in Eurasia. In this study, we explicitly test the role of climate in shaping leopards population dynamics across the continents, by quantitatively combining paleoclimatic, demographic, and genetic simulations over the last 450 thousand years. Using an Approximate Bayesian Computational framework, we show that the genetic structure differences between Africa and Asia can be explained by distinct historical climatic conditions in these two continents: most of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia exhibited a stable range without geographical barriers, while other areas such as Morocco, Afghanistan and Northeast Asia showed expansion and extinction cycles during glacial and interglacials. We further model population dynamics in Europe and validate it against fossil and radiocarbon dates records. We find that European populations were likely fragile, with extinctions repeatedly predicted over multiple glacial cycles, indicating that climate change possibly led to the extinction of the European subspecies following the LGM. Notably, we found that climate during the Holocene should have allowed a more recent recolonisation that did not happen, indicating other factors such as human presence might have blocked it.","[{""name"":""Cambridge Commonwealth European and International Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05sprqy15"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Actions"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101028348;101063265;""},{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/S007164/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""647787;""},{""name"":""Leverhulme Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012mzw131"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RPG-2020-317;""},{""name"":""Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

A crucial step in the development of computational tools for the objective and quantitative analysis of tissue sections has been color deconvolution. Color deconvolution functions by separating the absorption of colors corresponding to stained molecular or tissue compartments. The most widely used color deconvolution method in digital pathology, linear color deconvolution as described in Ruifrok 2001 et al., decomposes color images according to the absorbance values for individual stains. However, linear color deconvolution assumes that stains are linearly decomposable, and it relies heavily upon identifying optimal color vectors of stains, which is often challenging. Furthermore, linear deconvolution methods cannot deconvolve the image with more than three stains, further limiting their broader applicability. To combat the limitations of previous methods, we developed an intuitive and robust color deconvolution method that effectively and accurately separates more than three stain signals, does not rely on predetermined color vectors, and doesnt rely on identifying optimal stain vectors. The proposed method, NLTD 2.0, presents a robust and efficient solution to tackle color variations in histopathology images, enhancing the reliability and precision of computational pathology. Additionally, incorporating the method as an ImageJ plugin amplifies accessibility and usability, enabling researchers and pathologists to leverage its capabilities without specialized programming skills. The intuitive interface streamlines the application, fostering broader acceptance within the computational pathology community.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3CA275681;UH3CA275681;U54CA268083;R01CA300052;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM157099;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Yet, the mechanisms by which lipid imbalances are sensed and corrected to establish and maintain homeostasis are, in most cases, unknown. Here we present an expanded view of plasma membrane (PM) phosphoinositide metabolism by revealing an unexpected metabolic connection between two key anionic lipids in this membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidic acid (PA). PM pools of PI4P are generated by PI 4-kinase Type III (PI4KIII/PI4KA), an essential enzyme whose partial dysfunction leads to numerous hereditary human diseases. We find that depletion of PI4P by pharmacological inhibition of PI4KA increases the activity of phospholipase Ds (PLDs) and the levels of their lipid product, PA, in the PM. Guided by RNA-seq analysis and proximity labeling proteomics, we elucidate how cells connect this PI4P decrease to a compensatory increase in PA levels. Loss of PM PI4P induces a concomitant decrease of phosphatidylserine (PS) levels, and this metabolic rewiring activates a reciprocal relationship between PS synthesis and PLD-mediated PA generation. These metabolic changes also lead to transcriptional and translational upregulation of the small GTPase RhoB, which enhances PLD-mediated PA synthesis and subsequent actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Our study reveals how disease-relevant perturbation of phosphoinositide synthesis induces an integrated response that ultimately boosts levels of PA, a key anionic lipid and metabolic intermediate in phosphoinositide resynthesis.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM151682;DP1GM142101;Intramural Research Program;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

A central unresolved question, however, is whether lipidomic signatures identified in accessible peripheral biofluids faithfully recapitulate the pathogenic alterations within the central nervous system (CNS). This gap impedes the development of reliable biomarkers and constrains a comprehensive understanding of PD pathophysiology. To address this challenge, we employed a cross-species lipidomic approach. We modeled PD in both male and female mice by injecting human -synuclein preformed fibrils into the substantia nigra. Three months post-injection, lipidomic profiles of the midbrain and plasma were generated and compared. These findings were further validated in plasma from male and female PD patients and age-matched controls, enabling the identification of conserved alterations.

We identified shared dysregulation of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and fatty acids in the brains and plasma of diseased mice as well as in plasma from PD patients. Notably, lipids associated with lipid droplet biogenesis, including triacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols, were elevated in diseased mouse brains and patient plasma. These alterations coincided with a marked accumulation of lipid droplets in the mouse midbrain, and were further corroborated by increased lipid droplet abundance in macrophages derived from PD patients. Interestingly, lipid droplet accumulation exhibited sex-specific patterns: male mice displayed greater microglial accumulation, whereas female mice showed enhanced neuronal deposition. Together, these findings demonstrate that peripheral lipidomic signatures reflect CNS pathology in PD, highlighting new opportunities for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, sex-specific lipid droplet accumulation in innate immune cells and neurons implicates these pathways as mechanistic contributors to PD and underscores the necessity of sex-stratified strategies in biomarker discovery and disease modeling.","[{""name"":""Cure Parkinson's Trust"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PT01;""},{""name"":""Parkinson's Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mx85j86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PF-IMP-1437213;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04reqzt68"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IA/E/17/1/503664;""},{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ffdsr55"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SRG/2021/000981;""},{""name"":""Indian Council of Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0492wrx28"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5/4-5/3/43/Neuro/2022-NCD-1;5/4-5Adhoc/Neuro/217/2020-NCD-1;""},{""name"":""SwarnaJayanti Fellowship, SERB"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SB/SJF/2021-22/01;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

We anticipate that this approach will transform the way that structural biologists approach cellular heterogeneity in cryo-ET, as cells can be identified and classified reliably post acquisition.","[{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALT 836-2020;""},{""name"":""Peter und Traudl Engelhorn Stiftung"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Max Planck Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01hhn8329"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Intracellular Ca2+ signaling mediates a variety of macrophage functions. While diverse, ontogeny, transcriptional profiles, and phenotypes of meningeal macrophages have been described, little is known about their spatiotemporal Ca2+ signal dynamics in healthy and diseased states. We used two-photon Ca2+ imaging in a novel reporter mouse line, combined with an event-based signaling analysis pipeline, to comprehensively characterize the Ca2+ activity of meningeal macrophages both at steady state and in response to cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) - a pathophysiological brain hyperexcitability event, implicated in migraine, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. In homeostatic meninges of behaving mice, perivascular macrophages exhibit several Ca2+ activity features, including event duration and signal frequency spectrum, distinct from those of interstitial non-perivascular macrophages. The Ca2+ activity of dural perivascular macrophages is uniquely coupled to behaviorally driven diameter fluctuation of their associated vessels. Most perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages display propagating intracellular Ca2+ activity. Both macrophage subtypes also exhibit synchronized intercellular Ca2+ elevations, likely driven by an external factor. In response to CSD, the majority of perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages show a persistent decrease in their Ca2+ activity. Smaller subsets of both macrophage subtypes display either acute or persistent increases in Ca2+ activity, with the latter response mediated by CGRP/RAMP1 signaling. Collectively, our results highlight a previously unknown diversity of meningeal macrophage Ca2+ signaling at steady-state and in response to an aberrant brain hyperexcitability event.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21NS130561;R01NS115972;R01NS133625;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

While therapeutics have been developed to exploit these pH changes to modulate activity across different physiological environments, current approaches for generating pH-dependent binders, such as combinatorial histidine scanning and display-based selections, are largely empirical and often labor-intensive. Here we describe two complementary principles and associated computational methods for designing pH-dependent binders: (i) introducing histidine residues adjacent to positively charged residues at binder-target interfaces to induce electrostatic repulsion and weaken binding at low pH, and (ii) introducing buried histidine-containing charged hydrogen-bonding networks in the binder core such that the protein is destabilized under acidic conditions. Using these methods, we designed binders that dissociate at acidic pH against ephrin type-A receptor 2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, interleukin-6, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and the interleukin-2 mimic Neo2. Fusions of the designs to pH-independent binders of lysosomal trafficking receptors function as catalytic degraders, inducing target degradation at substoichiometric levels.

While numerous studies have explored functions for the GlialCAM IgG-like domains in brain development and physiology, functions for its cytoplasmic signaling tail remain largely unknown. Therefore, we developed a mutant mouse model that expresses a truncated GlialCAM construct (GlialCAM {Delta}CT) that contains intact extracellular and transmembrane domains but lacks the cytoplasmic tail. Deletion of the GlialCAM cytoplasmic domain in glial cells of the brain results in vacuolization within white matter regions without disrupting neurovascular barrier integrity.

Single cell transcriptome sequencing identifies GlialCAM-dependent defects in ECM remodeling pathways in white matter tracts. In situ spatial profiling revealed robust activation of astrocytes and microglia in the mutant brain. Proteomic analysis identified GlialCAM cytoplasmic tail interactors with links to MAPK signaling and cytoskeletal regulatory networks. These data reveal important functions for the GlialCAM cytoplasmic tail in homeostasis of white matter tracts in the adult murine brain.

Long reads present a unique challenge to pangenome mapping algorithms due to their length and error profile, which allow them to take more topologically complex paths through the pangenome graph and increase the possible search space for the algorithm. We present updates to Giraffe that allow it to quickly and accurately map long reads to pangenome graphs. For both short and long reads, Giraffe mapping to a pangenome containing data from more than 450 human haplotypes, generated by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, is comparable in speed to linear mappers to human reference genomes; Giraffe is also over an order of magnitude faster than GraphAligner, the current state-of-the-art long-read-to-pangenome mapper. Its alignments produce similar or improved small and structural variant calling results, compared to those from commonly used graph-based and linear mappers.

This coordination is inherently challenging for the brain. Effective coordination of multiple joints relies on intact feedforward control to predict movement dynamics in the initial phase of the movement, and on feedback control to fine-tune the execution in the final phase. However, the effect of aging on these specific control mechanisms remains controversial. In our experiment we investigated a pure elbow motion task using the KINARM exoskeleton. A group of 50 young (20-35 years old), 80 old (55-70 years old) and 30 older-old (80+ years old) healthy participants were recruited. Each participant performed 30{degrees} elbow rotations while stabilizing the shoulder joint. Movements were directed toward two distinct targets in both flexion and extension directions. The task was performed under two controlled speed conditions to maximally challenge the motor system, as higher elbow velocities increase interaction torques at the shoulder, demanding greater neuromuscular effort for stabilization. The timing and magnitude of anticipatory EMG activity of the agonist shoulder muscle, necessary to counteract interaction torques, were preserved across all age groups. Moreover, increasing elbow velocity did not result in any performance differences between young and older old adults, indicating that shoulder stabilization during movement initiation remained intact with age. However, older adults exhibited reduced ability to stabilize the shoulder position until the end of the movement, leading to decreased reaching accuracy with older age. These results suggest that feedforward control, essential for movement planning, which is essential for shoulder stabilization during initiation, is preserved during healthy aging and remains resilient to increased motor demands, even in older old adults. In contrast, feedback control appears to deteriorate with age, potentially contributing to reduced movement precision in the final phase of the multi-joint movement.","[{""name"":""Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Vlaanderen (FWO)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G095121N;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Although the nucleus is in mechanical equilibrium with the cell, we do not know whether and how chromatin reorganization actively regulates the mechanical properties and downstream behaviors of cells. Here, we tested the hypothesis that as a dynamic crosslinked polymer, chromatin directly impacts cell mechanics independently of transcription by studying NETosis: a transcription-independent process where chromatin decompacts and the plasma membrane (PM) ruptures. Using high resolution microscopy and ATAC-see, we found that chromatin accessibility progressively increases during NETosis suggesting that chromatin binding proteins (CBPs) dissociate from chromatin during NETosis. To determine the identity and dynamics of these dissociated CBPs, we used fluorescent recovery after photobleaching to measure the mobility and localization of the linker histone H1, the nucleosomal histone H3 and the heterochromatin binding protein HP1. We found that the mobile fraction of nuclear H1 increases during NETosis while fractions of HP1 and H3 diffuse outside of the nucleus suggesting that they become cytosolic osmolytes and potentially alter the mechanical state of cells. Consistently, we found that plasma membrane tension and cell volume increase as chromatin decompacts during NETosis. In non-NETing U2OS cells, we found that inducing chromatin decompaction increases plasma membrane tension, independently of the cytoskeleton, indicating a causal relationship between chromatin organization, cell volume and plasma membrane tension. Our findings reveal a novel non- genetic role of chromatin in cellular biophysics: regulating cell volume, PM tension, and thus, overall cell mechanics. Considering the critical role of cell mechanics in biological processes such as cell migration, proliferation and pathogen killing, our work broadens our understanding of how chromatin regulates cell physiology and pathology.

Significance StatementChromatin organizes our DNA inside the nucleus and is important for gene expression. However, chromatin is also a polymer which can passively regulate the rigidity of the nucleus, but whether and how chromatin can actively regulate the mechanical properties of the whole cell remains unknown. Here, we leverage the immune process of NETosis to show that the organization of chromatin inside the nucleus actively regulates the volume and tension of cells. Our work establishes chromatin as a long-range force generator in cells, broadening our understanding of the roles of this crucial polymer network in cells and opening the door to new strategies for controlling the mechanical properties of cells as needed by their physiology.","[{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00knt4f32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""David and Lucile Packard Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/032atxq54"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Koret Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02efnsc68"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00f54p054"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Characterization of STAU2 knockout iPSC derived cells using scRNA-seq shows that loss of STAU2 disrupts neuroepithelial cell identity and accelerates neural differentiation by altering the activity of key transcription factors and driving early metabolic transitions. Additionally, STAU2 regulates the expression of miRNA host genes and alters miRNA-mediated post- transcriptional control in progenitor cells, which exerts additional effects on STAU2 regulated gene regulatory networks. These changes result in neural progenitor exhaustion, unstructured neural rosettes, and reduced organoid size. Together, our work uncovers a previously unrecognized role for STAU2 as a central regulator of early human neurogenesis, acting through both miRNA-mediated and transcriptional pathways to coordinate progenitor maintenance and neuronal fate specification.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Comparative analyses revealed that xenarthran genomes harbor the highest number of retrocopies reported among mammals, with lineage-specific insertion dynamics. Anteater and armadillo genomes contain older LINE1 repertoires and species-specific older retrocopy insertions. In contrast, sloths retain both an abundance of young LINE1s and thousands of young retrocopies, alongside a large shared set that originated from an evolutionary burst of retroduplication in the branch leading to their last common ancestor ([~]30 Mya). In C. didactylus, approximately 50% of retrocopies are expressed, compared with 24% in Dasypus novemcinctus. Evolutionary analyses identified 38 retrocopies with strong hallmarks of domestication in C. didactylus. Many of these retrocopies derive from parental genes involved in mitochondrial and metabolic processes, suggesting a genomic mechanism underlying the physiological specialisations of sloths.

Despite their young age (<6 million years), HSD genes exhibit widespread regulatory divergence, with paralog-specific expression patterns documented across a variety of tissues and cell types. Using long-read expression and epigenomic data, we show that human-specific paralogs tend to have lower activity than the shared, ancestral ones. To systematically characterize the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) within HSDs and understand patterns of regulatory change in recently evolved gene families, we conducted a massively parallel reporter assay of 7,160 human duplicated and chimpanzee orthologous sequences in lymphoblastoid (GM12878) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines. A large proportion (14&ndash24%) of sequences exhibited differential activity relative to the chimpanzee ortholog (or between human paralogs), mostly with small fold-differences. Combining measured activity levels across all assayed sequences, predicted differences in cis-regulatory activity correlated with mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y. Differentially active CREs were validated for CHRFAM7A, HYDIN2, and SRGAP2C that may contribute to paralog-specific expression patterns and thereby to human-specific traits. While we find some changes in CRE activity shared between duplicate paralogs likely driving regulatory divergence in gene expression, consideration of non-shared adjacent sequences to duplications suggests a larger role for altered genome positional effects. In all, this work suggests that functional divergence of duplicated CREs contributes moderately to regulatory divergence of HSD genes and uncovers enhancers that are candidate drivers of human-specific regulatory patterns.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach.

However, vividness is ill-defined as it lacks an objective reference. Here, we present survey results that suggest vividness is nevertheless a robust trait. It explains individual differences of a broad range of subjective experiences, from the detail of mental imagery, the propensity to report having other internally generated visual experiences, and the vividness of visual dreams. Critically, simple vividness ratings can replace the protracted questionnaires commonly used for this purpose and reduce methodological issues with these instruments. We further find that vividness is closely linked with the experience of ""seeing"" mental images or projecting them into the external world. People who report seeing mental images with their eyes shut are also more likely to experience externally projected imagery. Nevertheless, many people report having mental depictions but without seeing. Overall, our results indicate we should redefine visual aphantasia to distinguish individuals with faint or unseen visual images from those completely lacking a pictorial representation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central to cellular signalling and represent one of the largest classes of therapeutic targets, yet their functional modulation remains challenging. Here, we present RareFoldGPCR (RFG), a GPCR-specialised AI model for structure prediction and design that supports NCAAs. By applying transfer learning on high-resolution GPCR structures, RFG accurately models and rationally designs both linear and cyclic peptides that incorporate NCAAs and modulate GPCR activity. This is achieved without the model ever being trained on NCAA-based GPCR modulators. We showcase the capability of RFG by designing peptide agonists for the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and validating their functional activity experimentally in cell-based assays. We investigate the precise capabilities of generating active agonists by expanding different regions of the native GLP-1 hormone, and further demonstrate the design of cyclic peptide agonists with entirely novel sequences and topologies, creating new agonist modes. We analyse how design metrics relate to pathway specificity, enabling precise modulation of pathway activity, such as activating the cAMP response without recruiting {beta}-arrestin to reduce receptor desensitisation. RFG shows how transfer learning on specific target classes enables generalisation to new chemistry and molecular topology, providing a broadly applicable strategy for designing functional ligands beyond the constraints of natural amino acid chemistry.

Processes that govern species-specific aspects of human postnatal brain development are difficult to study in animal models. While human brain organoids offer a promising in vitro model, they have thus far been shown to largely mimic early stages of brain development. Here, we developed human brain organoids for an unprecedented 5 years in culture, optimizing growth conditions able to extend excitatory neuron viability beyond previously-known limits. Using module scores of maturation-associated genes derived from a time course of endogenous human brain maturation, we show that brain organoids transcriptionally age with cell type-specificity through these many years in culture. Whole-genome methylation profiling reveals that the predicted epigenomic age of organoids sampled between 3 months and 5 years correlates precisely with time spent in vitro, and parallels epigenomic aging in vivo. Notably, we show that in chimeric organoids generated by mixing neural progenitors derived from ""old"" organoids with progenitors from ""young"" organoids, old progenitors rapidly produce late neuronal fates, skipping the production of earlier neuronal progeny that are instead produced by their young counterparts in the same co-cultures. The data indicate that human brain organoids can mature and record the passage of time over many years in culture. Progenitors that age in organoids retain a memory of the time spent in culture reflected in their ability to execute age-appropriate, late developmental programs.","[{""name"":""Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01tm9b530"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Klarman Cell Observatory"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Today, images of biological structures can be acquired using different imaging technologies and at increasing resolutions. However, identifying relevant structural features in three-dimensional (3D) images remains a significant challenge. 3D image segmentation is usually performed using deep-learning segmentation models. Such models are trained on manually annotated and segmented, dataset-specific images. Consequently, they rarely generalize across datasets. Here, we overcome these limitations with TopoTome, an unsupervised 3D image segmentation and analysis algorithm. TopoTome is based on topological data analysis, and conceptually distinct from standard clustering and deep learning image analysis models. It encodes the 3D image directly in topological space. Then, it performs unsupervised clustering to detect and segment features represented by salient and spatially coherent voxel intensity gradients. We demonstrate on simple, complex, synthetic and real-world 3D image data that it outperforms all 3D clustering algorithms. Its segmentation ranks with or outperforms best-in-class deep learning 3D image segmentation software. Beyond image segmentation, it provides streamlined topological data analysis of 3D images, advancing 3D image analysis from conventional mesh volumetry to structural topology. Owing to its conceptually different topological data analysis core, TopoTome does not need prior information and tuning to generalize across different imaging modalities, including fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. We show it also readily generalizes across biological subjects, such as different species, organs and cells. TopoTome is thus one of the most versatile and accurate unsupervised 3D image segmentation algorithms.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Studies of West African arthropod diversity can therefore help address important questions regarding conservation, ecosystem services, and insecticide use and other species-control interventions in agriculture and disease management. We intensively sampled arthropods in Ghana using complementary trapping methods, generated DNA barcodes, and classified sequences by Barcode Index Numbers (BINs, a species proxy). Using this dataset, we investigate assemblage composition, temporal activity patterns, and the state of regional biodiversity sampling.

ResultsSequencing DNA from 95,996 individuals captured using Malaise, yellow pan, pitfall, Heath and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) traps, we identified 10,120 unique BINs. The rate of species accumulation did not approach an asymptote for any taxonomic group or trap type, indicating high biodiversity. The different trap types sampled different subsets of the local community, with greatest similarity between yellow pan and pitfall traps. More insects and species (BINs) were trapped during the day than at night. Our dataset shared more BINs in the Barcode of Life Database with South Africa than with any other country, although this predominantly reflects the limited sampling and DNA sequencing campaigns in Africa.

ConclusionsThis study more than doubles the published BINs for West Africa, offering insights into the biodiversity of an ecologically important but understudied taxon and region. Using multiple trap types allowed a more complete assessment of the local arthropod assemblage. The public release of these data will support and stimulate further taxonomic and ecological work in the region.","[{""name"":""Open Philanthropy Project"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004d1k391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Structural analyses reveal that constitutive Leucine Rich Repeat-malectin interactions preconfigure IGP1 for ligand recognition and that the receptor features a highly specific sugar-binding pocket in the LRR domain capable of distinguishing fine variations in glycan structures.

Mechanistically, BRONJ activated the COL2A1-CD44 axis (EC-to-fibroblast/macrophage signaling) and COL2A1-SDC4 axis (EC-to-fibroblast signaling), whereas lineage tracing excluded endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), implicating extracellular matrix remodeling as the driver of dysfunction. Cross-species validation in human mandibles further confirmed vascular-lymphatic dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and aberrant chondrogenesis. Overall, this study establishes vascular and lymphatic dysfunction as a central pathological hallmark of BRONJ, driving matrix remodeling dysregulation and immune-inflammatory imbalance, and identifies the COL2A1-CD44/SDC4 axis as a potential therapeutic target for BRONJ.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Nature Science Foundations of China"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at [~]10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.

Significance StatementThis study tested resonance properties of the infant visual system upon perturbation. For the visual stimulation at discrete frequencies between 2 and 30Hz, the infant brain responded at 4Hz independent of the stimulation frequency. Following broadband stimulation, a perceptual echo at 4Hz emerged - resonating the 4Hz component of visual information over several cycles. These findings reveal that the 4Hz theta rhythm is an inherent processing dynamic of the infant visual system, contrasting with the 10Hz rhythm found in adults. The processing dynamics of the human visual system undergo fundamental changes from infancy into adulthood.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KO 6028/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963801

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963802

Some of these targets have been successfully resolved by binding to antibody fragments (Fabs) or fusing with external scaffolds to increase their size. Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963802

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

Here, we identify mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 as key mechanotransducers required for labor progression. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963802

While we have some understanding of how sensory information is processed in the sensory periphery, the classification of cues according to valence in central brain circuits is less well understood. Here, we addressed this question in the Drosophila larva, where we could leverage the synaptic resolution connectome to determine where innate and learnt information from distinct aversive and appetitive sensory modalities converges; and combine this with imaging and manipulation of neural activity to determine how valence information is encoded and used to guide navigation. We found that information from multiple innately aversive and attractive sensory modalities converges onto a common output neuron of the learning circuit, specifically the Mushroom Body output neuron, MBON-m1. We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors.

Yet these transitions also involve coordinated shifts in cell morphology and behaviour, which remain poorly characterized in densely packed epithelia. We developed a quantitative live-imaging and computational framework to track thousands of individual cells over time in the rapidly differentiating Xenopus mucociliary epithelium (MCE). From segmentations and trajectories, we extracted dynamic features-cell and nuclear shape, movement, position-to create a time-resolved morphodynamic dataset spanning the full course of differentiation. While single features showed high noise and low separability of ground-truth cell types, supervised machine learning revealed that integrating time-resolved features robustly predicts final cell fate. Gradient-boosted trees and multinomial logistic regression achieved moderate but consistent accuracy, especially for abundant epithelial lineages. Key discriminants included normalized Z-position, membrane-nucleus offset, and absolute experimental time, whereas movement contributed minimally to the results. Our results show that morphodynamic signatures encode predictive information about cell identity and provide a framework linking physical dynamics with molecular state.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21CC0073729;NNF19SA0035442;NNF22OC0076414;NNF19OC0056962;""},{""name"":""European Research Council CoG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101125803 MechanoFate;""},{""name"":""LEO Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02rgsr590"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LF-OC-19-000219;""},{""name"":""GENCI-IDRIS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A0161013396;AD011013695;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759874963802
