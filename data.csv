Current de-extinction efforts focus on genetically modifying the closely related Asian elephant to express woolly mammoth traits. In this study, we establish a multiplex-edited mouse model with modifications in genes associated with hair morphology and lipid metabolism, enabling insights into traits involved in developing woolly hair and cold tolerance. Our optimized workflows achieved high editing efficiencies and produced genetically modified mice with simultaneous editing of up to seven different genes. Selected modifications include loss-of-function mutations in Fgf5, Tgm3, and Fam83g, among others. The resulting mice display exaggerated hair phenotypes including curly, textured coats, and golden-brown hair. This study establishes a rapid platform for testing mammoth-centric genetic variants while advancing methods for complex genetic model generation. These approaches inform de-extinction efforts and research into the genetic basis of mammalian hair development and cold adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

There are > 10,000 new hospitalizations per week in the U.S., many of whom develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), or ""long COVID"", with long-term health issues and compromised quality of life. Early identification of individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 is key for monitoring and supporting respiratory status and improving outcomes. Therefore, precision tools for early detection of patients at high risk of severe disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. Here we report an untargeted and longitudinal metabolomic study of plasma derived from adult patients with COVID-19. One-carbon metabolism, a pathway previously shown as critical for viral propagation and disease progression, and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment, scored strongly as differentially abundant in patients with severe COVID-19. A follow-up targeted metabolite profiling revealed that one arm of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, the methionine cycle, is a major driver of the metabolic profile associated with disease severity. The methionine cycle produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl group donor important for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and its high abundance was reported to correlate with disease severity. Further, genomic data from the profiled patients revealed a genetic contributor to methionine metabolism and identified the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene as a pre-existing predictor of disease trajectory - patients homozygous for the MTHFR C677T have higher incidence of experiencing severe disease. Our results raise the possibility that screening for the common genetic MTHFR variant may be an actionable approach to stratify risk of COVID severity and may inform novel precision COVID-19 treatment strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1741298887295

Such efforts have primarily been implemented at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), providing data for large resident populations but hindering the ability to implement targeted interventions or follow-ups. Conversely, building-level wastewater data exhibits increased variability due to rapid daily population dynamics but allows for targeted follow-up interventions or mitigation efforts. Here, we implemented a three-site wastewater sampling strategy on our university-affiliated medical campus from May 2021 to March 2024, comprised of two distinct hospital quadrants and a primarily research laboratory and classroom building. We first addressed several limitations in implementing hospital-level wastewater surveillance by optimizing sampling frequency and laboratory techniques. We subsequently improved our ability to model SARS-CoV-2 case counts using wastewater data by performing sensitivity analyses on viral shedding assumptions and testing the utility of internal normalization factors for population size. Our unique infrastructure allowed us to detect intra-hospital dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and diversity and confirmed that direct sequencing of wastewater was able to capture corresponding clinical viral diversity. In contrast, research building wastewater sampling showed that for most non-residential settings, despite low overall viral loads, a threshold approach can still be used to identify peaks in cases or transmission amongst the general population. Our study expands on current wastewater surveillance practices by examining the utility of and best practices for upstream and particularly hospital settings, enabling the use of non-municipal, medium-scale wastewater testing to inform efforts for reducing the burden of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1741298887295

Subsequently, spillovers of the virus from dairy cattle to humans have been reported. Pigs are an important reservoir in influenza ecology because they serve as a mixing vessel in which novel reassortant viruses with pandemic potential can be generated. Here, we show that oro-respiratory infection of pigs resulted in productive replication of a bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 B3.13 virus. Infectious viruses were mainly identified in the lower respiratory tract of principal infected pigs, and sero-conversion was observed in most of the principal pigs at later time points. In one animal, we detected the emergence of a mutation in hemagglutinin (HA) previously associated with increased affinity for mammalian-type alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid receptors, but this mutation did not reach consensus levels. Sentinel contact pigs remained sero-negative throughout the study, indicating lack of transmission. The results support that pigs are susceptible to a bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 B3.13 virus, but this virus did not replicate as robustly in pigs as mink-derived HPAI H5N1 and swine-adapted influenza viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

We developed JUNIPER (Joint Underlying Network Inference for Phylogenetic and Epidemiological Reconstructions), a highly-scalable pathogen outbreak reconstruction tool that incorporates intrahost variation, incomplete sampling, and algorithmic parallelization. Central to JUNIPER is a statistical model for within-host variant frequencies observed by next generation sequencing, which we validated on a dataset of over 160,000 deep-sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Combining this within-host variation model with population-level evolutionary and transmission models, we developed a method for inferring phylogenies and transmission trees simultaneously. We benchmarked JUNIPER on computer-generated and real outbreaks in which transmission links were known or epidemiologically confirmed. We demonstrated JUNIPER's real-world utility on two large-scale datasets: over 1,500 bovine H5N1 cases and over 13,000 human COVID-19 cases. Based on these analyses, we quantified the elevated H5N1 transmission rates in California and identified high-confidence transmission events, and demonstrated the efficacy of vaccination for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. By overcoming computational and methodological limitations in existing outbreak reconstruction tools, JUNIPER provides a robust framework for studying pathogen spread at scale.","NA","medrxiv",1741298887295

In many species, this is accomplished by primordial germ cells (PGCs), which give rise to sperm or eggs. PGCs are often specified far from the future gonads and must migrate through developing tissues to reach them. Failure to do so can result in infertility or germ cell tumours. While PGC migration is well characterized in some species, very little is known about their migration in mammalian embryos. Here, we performed dynamic and quantitative analyses of PGC migration from E7.5 to E9.5 in the mouse embryo, providing the first comprehensive study of the migratory characteristics of PGCs from their point of origin to the gonads. We demonstrate that migrating PGCs are influenced by the surrounding environment and, in contrast to other organisms, extend highly dynamic, actin-rich protrusions to navigate through ECM barriers and tight intercellular spaces. As PGCs migrate through increasingly confined spaces, they undergo significant nuclear deformation and become prone to nuclear rupture and DNA damage. Their migration under confinement may be aided in part by a depleted nuclear lamina that leads to wrinkled nuclear morphology. Our high-resolution and dynamic imaging approaches have uncovered a surprising risk to genome integrity in migrating PGCs, with implications for DNA repair and adaptations in nuclear mechanics in PGCs.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

Yet to date, the mechanism of HGT among eukaryotes has remained a mystery. Here, we demonstrate that Starships, a newly discovered group of cargo-mobilizing transposable elements, are active vectors of horizontally transferred DNA among eukaryotic species. We find that multiple Starships simultaneously transfer themselves and their cargo within and between fungal genera separated by upwards of 100 million years of evolution. Transferred Starships are recovered in strains with and without selection for particular Starship-encoded phenotypes. Using whole genome sequencing, we exclude alternative hypotheses such as heterokaryosis, parasex or the random uptake of exogenous DNA by showing that only Starship DNA is precisely transferred. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of the Hephaestus Starship into a new species increases metal resistance due to the genes carried by this element. Between 18-27% of all Starships in our focal genus, Paecilomyces, have evidence of horizontal transfer under natural conditions, including to other fungal genera, revealing Starship-mediated HGT to be a widespread and frequent phenomenon across filamentous fungi. This study identifies the first active genetic mechanism for HGT between eukaryotic species.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

However, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we leverage cross-species functional neuroimaging to examine whether variability in brain functional connectivity reflects distinct biological mechanisms. We find that fMRI connectivity alterations in 20 distinct mouse models of autism (n=549 individual mice) can be clustered into two prominent hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes. We show that these connectivity profiles are linked to distinct signaling pathways, with hypoconnectivity being associated with synaptic dysfunction, and hyperconnectivity reflecting transcriptional and immune-related alterations. Extending these findings to humans, we identify analogous hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes in a large, multicenter resting state fMRI dataset of n=940 autistic and n=1036 neurotypical individuals. Remarkably, hypo- and hyperconnectivity autism subtypes are replicable across independent cohorts (accounting for 25.1% of all autism data), exhibit distinct functional network architecture, are behaviorally dissociable, and recapitulate synaptic and immune mechanisms identified in corresponding mouse subtypes. Our cross-species investigation, thus, decodes the heterogeneity of fMRI connectivity in autism into distinct pathway-specific etiologies, offering a new empirical framework for targeted subtyping of autism.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

It is typically stored as a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM), whose elements are pairwise relatedness values between individuals. This relatedness has been defined in various contexts based on pedigree, genotype, phylogeny, coalescent times, and, recently, ancestral recombination graph (ARG). ARG-based GRMs have been found to better capture the structure of a population and improve association studies relative to the genotype GRM. However, calculating GRMs and further operations with them is fundamentally challenging due to inherent quadratic time and space complexity. Here, we first discuss the different definitions of relatedness in a unifying context, making use of the additive model of a quantitative trait to provide a definition of branch relatedness and the corresponding branch GRM. We explore the relationship between branch relatedness and pedigree relatedness through a case study of French-Canadian individuals that have a known pedigree. Through the tree sequence encoding of an ARG, we then derive an efficient algorithm for computing products between the branch GRM and a general vector, without explicitly forming the branch GRM. This algorithm leverages the sparse encoding of genomes with the tree sequence and hence enables large-scale computations with the branch GRM. We demonstrate the power of this algorithm by developing a randomized principal components algorithm for tree sequences that easily scales to millions of genomes. All algorithms are implemented in the open source tskit Python package. Taken together, this work consolidates the different notions of relatedness as branch relatedness and by leveraging the tree sequence encoding of an ARG it provides efficient algorithms that enable computations with the branch GRM that scale to mega-scale genomic datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date. Methods: We conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. Findings: Neuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 57.7% (49/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms. Interpretation: Our findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1741298887295

In former Roman territories, their emergence has traditionally been linked to mass migrations from outside the Roman Empire. However, recent studies have emphasised local continuity with some individual-level mobility. We generated and analysed 248 historic genomes from Late Roman (3rd and 4th century CE) and Early Medieval (5th-8th century CE) burial sites in southern Germany, comparing them to over 2,500 contemporary and Iron Age genomes in addition to 1,344 modern-day genomes from Germany, Italy and Great-Britain. Despite small inferred Early Medieval period community sizes, genetic diversity exceeded that of modern German cities. In the Altheim graveyard, established in the 5th century by a group of Northern European descent, we inferred a demographic shift in the 6th century with the integration of newcomers with ancestry typical of a nearby Roman military camp, likely as a result of the collapse of Roman state structures. We reconstructed multigenerational pedigrees and, using a novel approach to infer ancestry of unsampled relatives, inferred immediate intermarriage between incoming and local groups, with a distinct tendency for men from former Roman background marrying women of northern descent. Burial proximity correlates strongly with kinship, in some cases spanning six generations. These communities were organized around small family units, exhibited loosely patrilineal or bilateral descent patterns, practiced reproductive monogamy, and avoided close-kin marriages. Such practices reflect broader transformations in family structures that began during the Late Roman period, were transferred to small agrarian societies in the Early Medieval period, and continued to shape European societies. By the 7th century, ongoing admixture had shaped genetic diversity patterns into those resembling Central Europe today.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

To address these obstacles, we present the DASH assembly toolset, which combines features of Golden Gate-based cloning, recombineering, and site-specific recombinase systems. We developed (1) a set of donor vectors based on the GoldenBraid platform, (2) an acceptor vector derived from the plant transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector, pYLTAC17, and (3) a re-engineered recombineering-ready E. coli strain, CZ105, based on SW105. The initial assembly steps are carried out using the donor vectors following standard GoldenBraid assembly procedures. Importantly, existing parts and transcriptional units created using compatible Golden Gate-based systems can be transferred to the DASH donor vectors using standard single-tube restriction/ligation reactions. The cargo DNA from a DASH donor vector is then efficiently transferred in vivo in E. coli into the acceptor vector by the sequential action of a rhamnose-inducible phage-derived PhiC31 integrase and arabinose-inducible yeast-derived Flippase (FLP) recombinase using CZ105. Furthermore, recombineering-based post-assembly modification, including the removal of undesirable scars, is greatly simplified.

The intricate nature of biosynthetic enzymes poses a major challenge in accurately predicting the chemical structures of secondary metabolites solely based on genome sequences using current rule-based methods. Here, we present DeepSeMS, a large language model designed to predict the chemical structures of secondary metabolites from various microbial biosynthetic gene clusters. Built on the Transformer architecture, DeepSeMS innovatively identifies sequence features using functional domains of biosynthetic enzymes, and incorporates feature-aligned chemical structure enumeration for training data augmentation. External evaluation results show that DeepSeMS predicts more accurate chemical structures of secondary metabolites with a Tanimoto coefficient up to 0.6 compared with the ground truth, significantly outperforming antiSMASH and PRISM with coefficients of only 0.14 and 0.45 respectively. Moreover, DeepSeMS successfully predicted secondary metabolites for 96.60% of cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters, surpassing existing methods with success rates less than 50%. Leveraging DeepSeMS, we characterized over 65,000 novel secondary metabolites from the global ocean microbiome with previously undocumented structural types, ecological distribution, and biomedical applications especially antibiotics. A login-free and user-friendly web server for DeepSeMS (https://biochemai.cstspace.cn/deepsems/) has been launched, featuring an integrated global ocean microbial secondary metabolites repository to expedite the discovery of novel natural products. Collectively, this study underscores the great capacity of a large language model-driven method in revealing hidden biosynthetic potential of the global ocean microbiome.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

Although the olfactory systems of classic model organisms approximately follow this canonical organization, many exceptions are known. In particular, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes co-express multiple types of olfactory receptors in many OSNs. Why do some olfactory systems follow the canonical organization while others violate it? We approach this question from the normative perspective of efficient coding. We find that the canonical and non-canonical organizations optimally encode odor signals in different types of olfactory environment. Non-canonical olfaction is beneficial when relevant sources emit correlated odorants and the environment contains odorants from ethologically irrelevant odor sources. Our theory explains previous observations of receptor co-expression and provides a framework from which to understand the structure of early olfactory systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

However, existing AMPK- inhibitors available as tool compounds are largely limited to compound C/dorsomorphin and SBI-0206965, both of which suffer from poor selectivity and off-target effects. Here we describe the structure-based molecular insights and cellular actions of a recently identified potent AMPK inhibitor, BAY-3827. Kinase selectivity profiling and sequence analyses of kinases that are highly or weakly inhibited by BAY-3827 uncovered key conserved residues involved in its inhibitory mechanism. A 2.5 [A] co-crystal structure of the AMPK kinase domain (KD)-BAY-3827 complex and comparison with known KD-inhibitor structures, revealed an overlapping site in the ATP-binding pocket and an C helix-out conformation. A distinct feature of the BAY-3827-bound state is the formation of a disulfide bridge between the D helix Cys106 and the activation loop residue Cys174. This bridge appears to stabilize the activation loop such that Asn162 repositions the DFG motif Phe158 toward the C-terminal kinase lobe, displacing His137 and disrupting the regulatory spine, thereby promoting an inactive state. In hepatocytes, 2.5-5 M BAY-3827, but not the structurally resembling inactive BAY-974, fully blocked AMPK activator (MK-8722)-mediated phosphorylation of ACC1 and corresponding inhibition of lipogenesis. Unbiased transcriptome analysis in MK- 8722-treated wild-type and AMPK-null hepatocytes revealed that 5 M BAY-3827 downregulated >30% of MK-8722-stimulated AMPK-dependent genes. Based on its greater selectivity and potency substantiated by comprehensive structural and cellular investigations, BAY-3827 is a powerful tool to delineate AMPK functions.

Our agent-based simulations of the transfer dynamics of the conjugative plasmid pLS20 from Bacillus subtilis reveal that spatial organization, colony growth dynamics, and quorum-sensing regulation significantly influence plasmid dissemination. Increased donor-recipient mixing enhances plasmid transmission by reducing quorum-induced repression, while colony growth-driven displacement of donor cells alters the local distribution of quorum-sensing signals, enabling sustained conjugation activity at the colony periphery. Complementary ODE modeling captures macroscopic trends in plasmid transmission, providing insights into the interplay between spatial factors and regulatory mechanisms. By bridging single-cell regulatory dynamics with population-level behaviors, this study advances our understanding of bacterial conjugation on solid surfaces, offering potential strategies for mitigating the spread of antibiotic resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

Here, we introduce Brightness Demixing, a novel method for fluorophore discrimination that exploits brightness, which directly depends on the fluorophores extinction coefficient and quantum yield. By oversampling blinking events, we precisely quantify photon flux as a proxy for brightness, enabling robust differentiation of fluorophores independent of their spectral properties, without requiring additional spectral separation. Brightness Demixing operates within a single detection channel, eliminating the need for additional spectral filters or cameras. We demonstrate this approach with simultaneous two- and three-target imaging in both 2D and 3D configurations. By maintaining single-wavelength excitation and minimizing chromatic aberrations, this method significantly enhances multiplexing in SMLM while remaining fully compatible with existing setups. Brightness Demixing thus offers a simple yet powerful approach for expanding multi-target imaging capabilities in super-resolution microscopy.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

To address this question, we combined super-resolution STED imaging of bifunctional lipid probes with mathematical modeling. Quantification of 10 different lipid species revealed significant differences in pit partitioning, ranging from slight enrichment to moderate exclusion. We find that the lipid asymmetry in the plasma membrane is sufficient to explain the observed trend. Taken together, our findings imply that clathrin-mediated endocytosis has a minor selectivity for cytoplasmic leaflet lipids, but overall does not significantly contribute to lipid sorting compared to non-vesicular trafficking.

In cells, tropomyosin molecules form coiled-coil dimers, which then polymerise end-to-end with other dimers for actin association. Tropomyosin is challenging to tag for in vivo fluorescence microscopy without perturbing its polymerisation interfaces. We recently developed a fluorescent tag comprising a forty amino acid flexible linker capable of detecting tropomyosin in S. pombe actin cables and the actomyosin ring, and in patch-like structures that were previously unappreciated. We also used this strategy successfully to tag human TPM2.2, a prominent human muscle isoform. Here, we expand this tool to visualise eight other human tropomyosin isoforms, using mNeonGreen, mCherry and mStayGold tags.

We evaluated five pseudo-absence sampling techniques, considering pseudo-absence ratios, buffer radii, and density smoothing factors to determine the most effective modeling approach. Key environmental predictors included humidity, agricultural land-use, and forest cover, while temperature had minimal influence for both the virus and the vector.

DesignRetrospective online survey. The survey was co-designed with Long COVID patients and carers.

SettingRespondents were recruited from representative online panels in the U.S. and U.K. maintained by the data firm Dynata in early 2024.

ParticipantsAfter data cleaning, the final dataset comprised 1,816 respondents, 352 (19.4%) who reported Long COVID and 1,464 (80.6%) who did not.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe primary outcome was self-reported Long COVID, defined as experiencing symptoms related to a COVID-19 infection at least three months after the infection began. Participants were also asked to indicate whether they experienced no, mild or severe initial symptoms during each COVID-19 infection and to respond to nine questions that assessed different aspects of hypermobility: the Hakim and Grahame 5-part questionnaire (5PQ) and four additional co-produced questions. The 5PQ was used to identify individuals with generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). All nine questions were used to develop a measure of extreme hypermobility, based on the top 10th percentile of hypermobility among respondents in each of six groups sorted by age and gender.

ResultsIn separate binomial logistic regressions of the dataset controlling for sex assigned at birth, age, number of infections, and number of vaccine doses, both GJH (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.65) and extreme hypermobility (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.16) were found to be predictive of Long COVID. Hypermobility influences the odds of getting Long COVID through two pathways. First, both GJH and extreme hypermobility increase the risk that individuals with no or moderate initial symptoms from a COVID-19 infection experience Long COVID. Second, both GJH and extreme hypermobility are significant predictors of developing severe initial symptoms from (a) COVID-19 infection(s), which is independently associated with increased Long COVID risk. A mediation analysis confirmed that extreme hypermobility influences the odds of developing Long COVID in part by increasing the likelihood that individuals experience severe initial symptoms from (a) COVID infection(s).

ConclusionsBoth GJH and extreme hypermobility are significant risk factors for Long COVID. People with extreme hypermobility are at particularly high risk of developing Long COVID after an initial COVID-19 infection. Further research is needed to replicate these findings with other datasets and clarify the pathophysiology that explains why people with hypermobility may be at greater risk of Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1741298887295

Social withdrawal due to information overload was often described in ASD, and it was suspected that increased basal noise, i.e., excessive background neuronal activities in the brain could be a disease mechanism. However, experimental test of this hypothesis is limited. Loss-of-function mutations (deficiency) in SCN2A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2, have been revealed as a leading monogenic cause of profound ASD. Here, we revealed that Scn2a deficiency results in robust and multifaceted social impairments in mice. Scn2a-deficient neurons displayed an increased excitation-inhibition (E/I) ratio, contributing to elevated basal neuronal noise and diminished signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during social interactions. Notably, the restoration of Scn2a expression in adulthood is able to rescue both SNR and social deficits. By balancing the E/I ratio and reducing basal neuronal firing, an FDA-approved GABAA receptor-positive allosteric modulator improves sociability in Scn2a-deficient mice and normalizes neuronal activities in translationally relevant human brain organoids carrying autism-associated SCN2A nonsense mutation.

Repeated vaccination is essential for preparing against currently circulating and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants while enabling people to continue with daily life. Optimizing vaccination strategies is crucial to efficiently manage medical resources and establish an effective vaccination framework. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively understand vaccine-induced immunity dynamics and to be able to identify poor responders with lower sustained antibody titers as potential priorities for revaccination. We investigated longitudinal antibody titer data in a cohort of 2,526 people in Fukushima, Japan, from April 2021 to November 2022 for whom basic demographic and health information was available. Using mathematical modeling and machine learning, we stratified the time-course patterns of antibody titers after 2 primary doses and 1 booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We identified 3 notable populations, which we refer to as the durable, the vulnerable, and the rapid-decliner populations, approximately half of which remained in the same population after the booster dose. Notably, the rapid-decliner population experienced earlier infections than the others. Furthermore, when comparing IgG(S) titers, IgA(S) titers, and T-spot counts between participants who experienced breakthrough infections after booster vaccination and those who did not, we found that IgA(S) titers were significantly lower in breakthrough infected participants during the early stage after booster vaccination. Our computational approach is adaptable to various types of vaccinations. This flexibility can inform policy decisions on vaccine distribution to enhance immunity both in future pandemics and in the post-COVID-19 era.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

The assumption that pathogens and mammalian-associated bacteria remodel their lipid A PAMP because of host-microbe co-evolution is a long held-belief of microbial pathogenesis. We set out to test this fundamental principle by interrogating a Gram-negative genus presenting evidence of evolutionary events linked to the acquisition of essential virulence traits, resulting in pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. The genus Yersinia fulfil these requirements; the acquisition of the pYV virulence plasmid is one of the evolutionary events associated with virulence. At 37{degrees}C, only pathogenic Yersinia switch to deacylated lipid A, a modification that diminishes TLR4/MD-2 recognition and reduces inflammation. An engineered chimeric pathogenic Yersinia strain expressing the non-pathogenic lipid A profile efficiently engages with TLR4, demonstrating it is sufficient to switch the acylation pattern to modify the recognition by TLR4 and subsequent activation of inflammation. The lipid As of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species are modified with aminoarabinose and palmitate; therefore, only the reduced acylation of the lipid A PAMP is a trait associated with virulence. The decorations of lipid A do not alter TLR4 engagement but confer resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The chimeric pathogenic Yersinia strain expressing the non-pathogenic lipid A profile allows to ascertain whether the switch in the lipid A PAMP affects virulence. This strain showed enhanced motility due to an upregulation of the flhDC master regulator, and impaired cellular invasion through downregulation of rovA, a key invasion regulator. The expression and function of pYV-encoded virulence factors Yops and YadA were not affected. Nonetheless, the chimeric strain was attenuated in vivo, demonstrating that virulence factors cannot overcome a switch in the lipid A PAMP associated with pathogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295

We present three complementary approaches for predicting epitope relationships from antibody amino acid sequences. First, we analyze [~]18 million antibody pairs targeting [~]250 protein families and establish that a threshold of >70% CDRH3 sequence identity among antibodies sharing both heavy and light chain V-genes reliably predicts overlapping-epitope antibody pairs. Next, we develop a supervised contrastive fine-tuning framework for antibody large language models which results in embeddings that better correlate with epitope information than those from pre-trained models. Applying this contrastive learning approach to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain antibodies, we achieve 82.7% balanced accuracy in distinguishing same-epitope versus different-epitope antibody pairs and demonstrate the ability to predict relative levels of structural overlap from learning on functional epitope bins (Spearman{rho} = 0.25). Finally, we create AbLang-PDB, a generalized model for predicting overlapping-epitope antibodies for a broad range of protein families. AbLang-PDB achieves five-fold improvement in average precision for predicting overlapping-epitope antibody pairs compared to sequence-based methods, and effectively predicts the amount of epitope overlap among overlapping-epitope pairs ({rho} = 0.81). In an antibody discovery campaign searching for overlapping-epitope antibodies to the HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 8ANC195, 70% of computationally selected candidates demonstrated HIV-1 specificity, with 50% showing competitive binding with 8ANC195. Together, the computational models presented here provide powerful tools for epitope-targeted antibody discovery, while demonstrating the efficacy of contrastive learning for improving epitope-representation.","NA","biorxiv",1741298887295
