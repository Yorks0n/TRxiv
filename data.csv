Epigenetic clocks attempt to quantify differential aging between individuals, but they typically summarize aging as a single measure, ignoring within-person heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop novel systems-based methylation clocks that, when assessed in blood, capture aging in distinct physiological systems. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to link DNA methylation, system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures, and mortality risk. This yielded a panel of 11 system-specific scores- Heart, Lung, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Immune, Inflammatory, Blood, Musculoskeletal, Hormone, and Metabolic. Each system score predicted a wide variety of outcomes, aging phenotypes, and conditions specific to the respective system. We also combined the system scores into a composite Systems Age clock that is predictive of aging across physiological systems in an unbiased manner. Finally, we showed that the system scores clustered individuals into unique aging subtypes that had different patterns of age-related disease and decline. Overall, our biological systems based epigenetic framework captures aging in multiple physiological systems using a single blood draw and assay and may inform the development of more personalized clinical approaches for improving age-related quality of life.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations. Methods: A large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: The study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19's risk surpassing influenza's risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50). Conclusion: In this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1719785247128

Classic ecological theory holds that these systems develop following a sequenced orderly process that generally proceeds from fast-growing to slow-growing taxa and depends on life-history trade-offs. However, it is also possible that this developmental order is simply the path with the least environmental resistance for survival of the component species and hence favored by probability alone. Here, we use theory and data to show that the order from fast- to slow-growing taxa is the most likely developmental path for diverse systems when local taxon interactions self-organize to minimize environmental resistance. First, we demonstrate theoretically that a sequenced development is more likely than a simultaneous one, at least until the number of iterations becomes so large as to be ecologically implausible. We then show that greater diversity of taxa and life histories improves the likelihood of a sequenced order from fast- to slow-growing taxa. Using data from bacterial and metazoan systems, we present empirical evidence that the developmental order of ecological systems moves along the paths of least environmental resistance. The capacity of simple principles to explain the trend in the developmental order of diverse ecological systems paves the way to an enhanced understanding of the collective features characterizing the diversity of life.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

By connecting multi-'omics to a symptom matrix, BioMapAI identified both disease- and symptom-specific biomarkers, reconstructed symptoms, and achieved state-of-the-art precision in disease classification. We also created the first connectivity map of these 'omics in both healthy and disease states and revealed how microbiome-immune-metabolome crosstalk shifted from healthy to MECFS. Thus, we proposed several innovative mechanistic hypotheses for MECFS: Disrupted microbial functions - SCFA (butyrate), BCAA (amino acid), tryptophan, benzoate - lost connection with plasma lipids and bile acids, and activated inflammatory and mucosal immune cells (MAIT, gdT cells) with INFgamma; and GzA secretion. These abnormal dynamics are linked to key disease symptoms, including gastrointestinal issues, fatigue, and sleep problems.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Examples are reiki, aromatherapy, and reflexology. Salaried practitioners are employed to deliver these therapies, which are provided as palliative care, although they lack evidence of effectiveness. Such practices seem to conflict with efforts to make health care evidence based.

AimTo estimate the extent of certain pseudoscientific practices in NHS Trusts, and to evaluate the rationale for such provision.

DesignRelevant documents were requested from NHS Trusts under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). Main outcome measures were: number of trusts offering pseudoscientific practices in cancer departments, time to full FOIA response, presence and content of practice governance documents, and presence and quality of evidence for practices.

Setting/ParticipantsCancer care departments in NHS hospitals in England. No patient participants were involved in the survey.

Results13.6% of eligible NHS trusts were offering pseudoscientific clinical practices. No trust provided a valid business case, or any robust evidence for the practices. The governance documents included claims about chakras, meridians, and invisible ""energy"". Ten trusts required that informed consent be obtained from patients. This could not have been obtained because information given was misleading.

ConclusionsPseudoscientific practices are embedded in the NHS in England, and governance documents show poor understanding of clinical evidence.","NA","medrxiv",1719785247128

Diverse factors interact with nucleosomes to modulate chromatin architecture and facilitate DNA repair, replication, transcription, and other cellular processes. An important platform for chromatin binding is the H2A-H2B acidic patch. Here, we used AlphaFold-Multimer to screen over 7000 human proteins for nucleosomal acidic patch binding and identify 41 potential acidic patch binders. We determined the cryo-EM structure of one hit, SHPRH, with the nucleosome at 2.8 [A]. The structure confirms the predicted acidic patch interaction, reveals that the SHPRH ATPase engages a different nucleosomal DNA location than other SF2-type ATPases, and clarifies the roles of SHPRHs domains in nucleosome recognition. Our results illustrate the use of in silico screening as a high throughput method to identify specific interaction types and expands the set of potential acidic patch binding factors.

However, the technology is limited by inherent biases and its inability to capture full-length transcripts. Long-read RNAseq overcomes these issues by providing reads that can span multiple exons, resolve complex repetitive regions and the capability to cover entire transcripts. Unfortunately, this technology is still prone to higher error rates. Noncoding RNA transcripts are highly specific to different cell types and tissues and remain underrepresented in current reference annotations. This problem is exacerbated by the dismissal of sequenced reads that align to genomic regions that do not contain annotated transcripts, resulting in approximately half of the expressed transcripts being overlooked in transcriptional studies.

ResultsWe have developed a pipeline, named HyDRA (Hybrid de novo RNA assembly), which combines the precision of short reads with the structural resolution of long reads, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of custom transcriptome assemblies. Deep, short- and long-read RNAseq data derived from ovarian and fallopian tube samples were used to develop, validate and assess the efficacy of HyDRA. We identified more than 50,000 high-confidence long noncoding RNAs, most of which have not been previously detected using traditional methods.

ConclusionsHyDRAs assembly performed more than 40% better than a similar assembly obtained with the top-ranked stand-alone de novo transcriptome short-read-only assembly tool and over 30% better than one obtained with the best-in-class multistep short-read-only approach. Although long-read sequencing is rapidly advancing, the vast availability of short-read RNAseq data will ensure that hybrid approaches like the one implemented in HyDRA continue to be relevant, allowing the discovery of high-confidence transcripts within specific cell types and tissues. As the practice of performing hybrid de novo transcriptome assemblies becomes commonplace, HyDRA will advance the annotation of coding and noncoding transcripts and expand our knowledge of the noncoding genome.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

DNA repair is especially understudied in nondividing cells like neurons, which must withstand decades of DNA damage without replicating. This lack of knowledge limits the efficiency and precision of genome editing in clinically relevant cells. To address this, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons to examine how postmitotic human neurons repair Cas9-induced DNA damage. We discovered that neurons can take weeks to fully resolve this damage, compared to just days in isogenic iPSCs. Furthermore, Cas9-treated neurons upregulated unexpected DNA repair genes, including factors canonically associated with replication. Manipulating this response with chemical or genetic perturbations allowed us to direct neuronal repair toward desired editing outcomes. By studying DNA repair in postmitotic human cells, we uncovered unforeseen challenges and opportunities for precise therapeutic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Here, we report a mechanism by which autophagy is suppressed in cells exposed to bacterial toxin-, chemical-, or radiation-mediated sources of genotoxicity. Autophagy suppression is directly linked to cellular responses to DNA damage, and specifically the stabilization of the tumor suppressor p53, which is both required and sufficient for regulating the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent reduction in cellular pools of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3A/B), a key precursor of autophagosome biogenesis and maturation, in both epithelial cells and an ex vivo organoid model.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719785247128

Herein, we generated recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) bearing spikes from divergent bat CoVs to investigate their cell entry mechanisms. Unexpectedly, the successful recovery of rVSVs bearing the spike from SHC014, a SARS-like bat CoV, was associated with the acquisition of a novel substitution in the S2 fusion peptide-proximal region (FPPR). This substitution enhanced viral entry in both VSV and coronavirus contexts by increasing the availability of the spike receptor-binding domain to recognize its cellular receptor, ACE2. A second substitution in the spike N-terminal domain, uncovered through forward-genetic selection, interacted epistatically with the FPPR substitution to synergistically enhance spike:ACE2 interaction and viral entry. Our findings identify genetic pathways for adaptation by bat CoVs during spillover and host-to-host transmission, fitness trade-offs inherent to these pathways, and potential Achilles heels that could be targeted with countermeasures.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

However, genome engineering in bacteria is still a complex, multi-step process requiring a donor DNA template for homology-directed repair of DSBs. Prime editing circumvents this need as the repair template is provided within the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Here, we developed make-or-break Prime Editing (mbPE) that allows for precise and effective genetic engineering in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast to traditional prime editing in which a nicking Cas9 is employed, mbPE harnesses wild type Cas9 in combination with a pegRNA that destroys the seed region or protospacer adjacent motif. Since most bacteria poorly perform template-independent end joining, correctly genome-edited clones are selectively enriched during mbPE. We show that mbPE can be used to introduce point mutations, deletions and targeted insertions, including protein tags such as a split luciferase, at selection efficiencies of over 93%. mbPE enables sequential genome editing, is scalable, and can be used to generate pools of mutants in a high-throughput manner. The mbPE system and pegRNA design guidelines described here will ameliorate future bacterial genome editing endeavors.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

As such its measurement is crucial for understanding many aspects of animal behaviour, ecology and evolution, along with many more applications in fields ranging from optical physics, agriculture/plant sciences, human psychophysics, food science, architecture and materials sciences. The escalating threat of artificial light at night (ALAN) presents unique challenges for measuring the visual impact of light pollution, requiring measurement at low light levels across the human-visible and ultraviolet ranges, across all viewing angles, and often with high within-scene contrast.

Here I present a hyperspectral open-source imaging system (HOSI), an innovative and low-cost solution for collecting full-field hyperspectral data. The system uses a Hamamatsu C12880MA micro spectrometer to take single-point measurements, together with a motorised gimbal for spatial control. The hardware uses off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts, costing around {pound}350 in total. The system can run directly from a computer or smartphone with a graphical user interface, making it highly portable and user-friendly.

The HOSI system can take panoramic hyperspectral images that meet the difficult requirements of ALAN research, sensitive to low light around 0.001 cd.m-2, across 320-880nm range with spectral resolution of [~]9nm (FWHM) and spatial resolution of [~]0.2 degrees. The independent exposure of each pixel also allows for an extremely wide dynamic range that can encompass typical natural and artificially illuminated scenes, with sample night-time scans achieving peak-to-peak dynamic ranges of >50,000:1.

This systems adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and open-source nature position it as a valuable tool for researchers investigating the complex relationships between light, environment, behaviour, ecology, and biodiversity, with further potential uses in many other fields.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

IFN-I signaling drives the expression of hundreds of IFN-I stimulated genes (ISGs), whose aggregate function results in the control of viral infection. A few of these ISGs are tasked with negatively regulating the IFN-I response to prevent overt inflammation. ISG15 is a negative regulator whose absence leads to persistent, low-grade elevation of ISG expression and concurrent, self-resolving mild autoinflammation. The limited breadth and low-grade persistence of ISGs expressed in ISG15 deficiency are sufficient to confer broad-spectrum antiviral resistance. Inspired by ISG15 deficiency, we have identified a nominal collection of 10 ISGs that recapitulate the broad antiviral potential of the IFN-I system. The expression of the 10 ISG collection in an IFN-I non-responsive cell line increased cellular resistance to Zika, Vesicular Stomatitis, Influenza A (IAV), and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. A deliverable prophylactic formulation of this syndicate of 10 ISGs significantly inhibited IAV PR8 replication in vivo in mice and protected hamsters against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, suggesting its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral against many current and future emerging viral pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

The main building block of the long, external flagellar filament, flagellin, is secreted through the flagellar type-III secretion system at a remarkable rate of several tens of thousands amino acids per second, significantly surpassing the rates achieved by other pore-based protein secretion systems. The evolutionary implications and potential benefits of this high secretion rate for flagellum assembly and function, however, have remained elusive. In this study, we provide both experimental and theoretical evidence that the flagellar secretion rate has been evolutionarily optimized to facilitate rapid and efficient construction of a functional flagellum. By synchronizing flagellar assembly, we found that a minimal filament length of 2.5 um was required for swimming motility. Biophysical modelling revealed that this minimal filament length threshold resulted from an elasto-hydrodynamic instability of the whole swimming cell, dependent on the filament length. Furthermore, we developed a stepwise filament labeling method combined with electron microscopy visualization to validate predicted flagellin secretion rates of up to 10,000 amino acids per second. A biophysical model of flagellum growth demonstrates that the observed high flagellin secretion rate efficiently balances filament elongation and energy consumption, thereby enabling motility in the shortest amount of time. Taken together, these insights underscore the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the development and optimization of the flagellum and type-III secretion system, illuminating the intricate interplay between functionality and efficiency in assembly of large macromolecular structures.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Software designed for transcript-level differential expression analyses account for the uncertainty of transcript quantification, the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA), in statistical analyses via resampling methods. Bootstrap sampling is a popular resampling method that is implemented in the RNA-seq quantification tools kallisto and Salmon. However, bootstrapping is computationally intensive and provides replicate counts with low resolution when the number of sequence reads originating from a gene is low. For lowly expressed genes, bootstrap sampling results in noisy replicate counts for the associated transcripts, which in turn leads to non reproducible and unrealistically high RTA overdispersion for those transcripts. Gibbs sampling is a more efficient and high resolution algorithm implemented in Salmon. Here we leverage the latest developments of edgeR 4.0 to present an improved differential transcript expression analysis pipeline with Salmon's Gibbs sampling algorithm. The new bias-corrected quasi-likelihood method with adjusted deviances for small counts from edgeR, combined with the efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm from Salmon, provides faster and more accurate DTE analyses of RNA-seq data. Comprehensive simulations and test data show that the presented analysis pipeline is more powerful and efficient than previous differential transcript expression pipelines while providing correct control of the false discovery rate.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Here, we report a molecular characterisation of full-length, phosphorylated MORC2, demonstrating its preference for binding open chromatin and functioning as a DNA sliding clamp. We identified a phosphate interacting motif within the CTD that dictates ATP hydrolysis rate and cooperative DNA binding. The DNA binding impacts several structural domains within the ATPase region. We provide the first visual proof that MORC2 induces chromatin remodelling through ATP hydrolysis-dependent DNA compaction, regulated by its phosphorylation state. These findings highlight phosphorylation of MORC2 CTD as a key modulator of chromatin remodelling, presenting it as a potential therapeutic target.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

They speak a Niger-Congo language called Fulfulde or Pulaar and live in scattered locations across the Sahel/Savannah Belt, from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Chad. According to historical records, their ancestors spread from Futa Toro in the Middle Senegal Valley to Futa-Jallon in Guinea, and then eastward into the Sahel belt over the past 1500 years. However, the earlier history of this traditionally pastoral population has not been well studied. To uncover the genetic structure and ancestry of this widespread population, we gathered genome-wide genotype data from 460 individuals across 18 local Fulani populations, along with comparative data from both modern and ancient worldwide populations. This represents the most geographically wide-scaled genome-wide study of the Fulani to date. We revealed a genetic component closely associated with all local Fulani populations, suggesting a shared ancestral component possibly linked to the beginning of African pastoralism in the Green Sahara. Comparison to ancient DNA results also identified the presence of an ancient Iberomaurusian associated component across all Fulani groups, providing novel insights into their deep genetic history. Additionally, our genetic data indicate a later Fulani expansion from the western to the eastern Sahel, characterized by a clinal pattern and admixture with several other African populations north of the equator.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Perhaps the most fundamental and far-reaching finding from this work is that the storage of new memories implies the partial erasure of already-stored ones. This overwriting leads to a decorrelation of sensory-driven activity patterns over time, even if the input patterns remain similar. Representational drift (RD) should therefore be an expected and inevitable consequence of ongoing memory storage. We tested this hypothesis by fitting a network model to data from long-term chronic calcium imaging experiments in mouse hippocampus. Synaptic turnover in the model inputs, consistent with the ongoing encoding of new activity patterns, accounted for the observed statistics of RD. This mechanism also provides a parsimonious explanation for the recent finding that RD in CA1 place cells has two distinct components: one which depends only on the passage of time, and another which depends on the time spent exploring a given environment. Furthermore, in the context of ongoing learning, the drift rate of any one memory depends on its repetition rate, a mechanism which can reproduce the diverse effects of experience on drift found in experiment. Our results suggest that RD should be observed wherever neuronal circuits are involved in a process of ongoing learning or memory storage.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Here, we characterize the impact of the linkage disequilibria, which stabilizing selection generates on a rapid timescale, on the subsequent allele-frequency dynamics at individual loci, which proceed on a slower timescale. We obtain expressions for the expected per-generation change in minor-allele frequency at individual loci, as functions of the effect sizes at these loci, the strength of selection on the trait, its variance and heritability, and the linkage relations among loci.

Here, we set out to elucidate fundamental properties of cis-regulatory sequences in plants. Using massively parallel reporter assays across four plant species, we demonstrate the central role of sequences downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) in transcriptional regulation. Unlike animal enhancers that are position-independent, plant regulatory elements depend on their position, as altering their location relative to the TSS significantly affects transcription. We highlight the importance of the region downstream of the TSS in regulating transcription by identifying a DNA motif that is conserved across vascular plants and is sufficient to enhance gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The identification of a large number of position-dependent enhancers points to fundamental differences in gene regulation between plants and animals.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

We used a hybrid de novo assembly approach combining two long-reads single molecule sequencing technologies, Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences, together with scaffolding with Hi-C libraries. The final assembly is 1.03GB in size with BUSCO assessment of the assembly completeness of 97.7% of single-copy orthologs clusters.

Comparison of the assembly to the progenitor subgenomes, separated the set of chromosome sequences inherited from C. canephora from those of C. eugenioides., Corresponding orthologs between Geisha and Red Bourbon had a 99.67% median identity, higher than what we observe with the progenitor assemblies (median 97.28%). Both, Geisha and Red Bourbon contain an inversion on Chromosome 10 relative to the pseudomolecules of the genetic material inherited from the two progenitors that must have happened before the separation in the geographical migration of the two varieties. Lending support of a single allopolyploidization event that gave origin to C. arabica after the hybridization event with the two progenitor lines. Broadening the availability of high-quality genome assemblies of Coffea arabica varieties, paves the way for understanding the evolution and domestication of coffee, as well as the genetic basis and environmental interactions of why a variety like Geisha is capable of producing beans with such exceptional and unique high-quality.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

We have used SCALPEL to study the changes in isoform usage during mouse spermatogenesis and in the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to neural progenitors. These analyses allow the identification of novel cell populations that cannot be defined using conventional gene expression profiles, confirm known changes in 3 UTR length during cell differentiation, and identify cell-type specific miRNA signatures controlling isoform expression in individual cells. Together, our work highlights how SCALPEL expands the current scRNA-seq toolset to explore post-transcriptional gene regulation in individual cells from different species, tissues, and technologies to investigate the variability and the specificity of gene regulatory mechanisms at the single-cell level.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood-- and addressed--as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our estimands. Second, we develop estimators for these effects-- namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal estimates from the joint posterior distribution. Throughout the manuscript, we develop models layer by layer, thereby illustrating an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks. We conclude by summarising this workflow as a set of seven steps, and provide practical recommendations.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Until now, these viruses were only sporadically found in the digestive system of vertebrates. Here, we present the identification and genomic characterization of a proposed third order of viruses within the class Pokkesviricetes that currently consists of poxviruses and asfuviruses8. Members of this newly identified order we provisionally named Egovirales are commonly in the digestive system of vertebrates worldwide and are abundant in >10% of livestock animals, >2% of humans, and wild animals. Egoviruses have linear genomes up to 467 kbp in length and likely form multilayered icosahedral capsids, similar to those of asfuviruses. However, phylogenetic analysis of conserved viral genes indicates that egoviruses are the sister group of poxviruses, with implications for capsid evolution. The diversity of egoviruses already far exceeds that of all known poxviruses and animal-associated asfuviruses. Phylogenetic analyses and patterns of virus distribution across vertebrates suggest that egoviruses can be either specialists or generalists associated with a single or multiple vertebrate species, respectively. Notably, one egovirus clade is human-specific, evolutionarily constrained, and spread across continents, demonstrating a long-term association between Egovirales and the human population on the global scale.

This sensitization depends on new gene expression that is primarily regulated via transcriptional and translational control mechanisms. The relative roles of these mechanisms in regulating gene expression in the clinically relevant chronic phase of neuropathic pain are not well understood. Here, we show that changes in gene expression in the spinal cord during the chronic phase of neuropathic pain are substantially regulated at the translational level. Downregulating spinal translation at the chronic phase alleviated pain hypersensitivity. Cell-type-specific profiling revealed that spinal inhibitory neurons exhibited greater changes in translation after peripheral nerve injury compared to excitatory neurons. Notably, increasing translation selectively in all inhibitory neurons or parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, but not excitatory neurons, promoted mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, increasing translation in PV+ neurons decreased their intrinsic excitability and spiking activity, whereas reducing translation in spinal PV+ neurons prevented the nerve injury-induced decrease in excitability. Thus, translational control mechanisms in the spinal cord, particularly in inhibitory neurons, play a role in mediating neuropathic pain hypersensitivity.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Dentate gyrus granule cells, CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs), and CA1 PNs are serially connected, forming a circuit that critically enables memory storage in the brain. However, fundamental aspects of hippocampal function go beyond this simplistic 'trisynaptic' definition. CA3 PNs connect not only to CA1, but also establish the largest autoassociative network in the brain. In addition, CA3 PNs are not uniform, differing in their morphology, intrinsic properties, and even the extent of granule cell input. Understanding how these different subtypes of CA3 PNs are embedded in the hippocampal network is essential for our quest to understand learning and memory. Here, we performed simultaneous multi-cellular patch-clamp recordings from up to eight CA3 PNs in acute mouse hippocampal slices, testing 3114 possible connections between identified cells. Combined with post-hoc morphological analysis, this allowed full characterization of neuronal heterogeneity in functioning microcircuits. We demonstrate that CA3 PNs can be divided into distinct 'deep' and 'superficial' subclasses, with altered input-output balance. While both subtypes formed recurrent connectivity within classes, connectivity between subtypes was surprisingly asymmetric. Recurrent connectivity was abundant from superficial to deep, but almost absent from deep to superficial PNs, thereby splitting CA3 into parallel recurrent networks which will allow more complex information processing. Finally, we observed innervation of PN subclasses by distinct interneurons, a potential mechanism to gate information flow through CA3 sublayers. Together, our data present a major revision to the classical 'trisynaptic' view of the hippocampus, bringing us closer to understanding its complex action in information storage.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Although gene expression is complex, differential expression of many genes is often due to regulation by just a handful of TFs. Despite extensive efforts to elucidate TF-target regulatory relationships in C. elegans, existing experimental datasets cover distinct subsets of TFs and leave data integration challenging.

Here I introduce CelEsT, a unified gene regulatory network (GRN) designed to estimate the activity of 487 distinct C. elegans TFs - [~]58% of the total - from gene expression data. To integrate data from ChIP-seq, DNA-binding motifs, and eY1H screens, different GRNs were benchmarked against a comprehensive set of TF perturbation RNA-seq experiments and identified optimal processing of each data type. Moreover, I showcase how leveraging conservation of TF binding motifs in the promoters of candidate target orthologues across genomes of closely-related species can distil targets into a select set of highly informative interactions, a strategy which can be applied to many model organisms. Combined analyses of multiple datasets from commonly-studied conditions including heat shock, bacterial infection and male-vs-female comparison validates CelEsTs performance and highlights previously overlooked TFs that likely play major roles in co-ordinating the transcriptional response to these conditions.

CelEsT can be used to infer TF activity on a standard laptop computer within minutes. Furthermore, an R Shiny app is provided for the community to perform rapid analysis with minimal coding experience required. I anticipate that widespread adoption of CelEsT will significantly enhance the interpretive power of transcriptomic experiments, both present and retrospective, thereby advancing our understanding of gene regulation in C. elegans and beyond.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

However, unlike the interactions between chromatin segments, the strength of chromatin-lamina interactions and their dependence on cellular environment are not well understood. Here, we develop a theory to predict the size and shape of peripheral heterochromatin domains by considering the energetics of chromatin-chromatin interactions, the affinity between chromatin and the nuclear lamina and the kinetics of methylation and acetylation9in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Through the analysis of super-resolution images of peripheral heterochromatin domains using this theoretical framework, we determine the nuclear lamina-wide distribution of chromatin-lamina affinities. We find that the extracted affinity is highly spatially heterogeneous and shows a bimodal distribution, indicating regions along the lamina with strong chromatin binding and those exhibiting vanishing chromatin affinity interspersed with some regions exhibiting a relatively diminished chromatin interactions, in line with the presence of structures such as nuclear pores. Exploring the role of environmental cues on peripheral chromatin, we find that LAD thickness increases when hMSCs are cultured on a softer substrate, in correlation with contractility-dependent translocation of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) from the cytosol to the nucleus. In soft microenvironments, chromatin becomes sequestered at the nuclear lamina, likely due to the interactions of HDAC3 with the chromatin anchoring protein LAP2{beta} ,increasing chromatin-lamina affinity, as well as elevated levels of the intranuclear histone methylation. Our findings are further corroborated by pharmacological interventions that inhibit contractility, as well as by manipulating methylation levels using epigenetic drugs. Notably, in the context of tendinosis, a chronic condition characterized by collagen degeneration, we observed a similar increase in the thickness of peripheral chromatin akin to that of cells cultured on soft substrates consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of the microenvironment in shaping genome organization and highlight its relevance in pathological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Aging-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress tumorigenesis, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here, using physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered mouse models and primary cells, we demonstrate aging suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by aging-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, leading to a functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1-lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescue stemness and promote tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1-lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells via induction of ferroptosis. We find that aging-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites associates with elevated NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells by inhibition of DNA methylation. We uncover that aging drives a functional iron insufficiency, which leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis, but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have significant implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate in young individuals, revealing a critical window for such cancer prevention efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Here we report yellow pitaya's high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly and link the phenotypic trait with genomic data, based on Hi-C, ATAC, and RNA-seq data of specific tissues. We declared yellow pitaya as an autotetraploid with a 7.16 Gb genome size (harboring 27,246 high confidence genes) and majorly evolved from diploid ancestors, which remains unknown. Beyond generating the genome assembly, we explored the 3D chromatin organization which revealed insights into the genome, compartments A (648 and 519), compartments B (728 and 1064), topologically associated domains-TADs (3376 and 2031), and varying numbers of structural variations (SVs) in diploid and polyploid pitaya species, respectively. Overall, TAD boundaries were enriched with the motifs of AP2, WRKY18/60/75, MYB63/116, PHL2, and GATA8 in both pitaya species. By linking the open chromatin genomic structure to function, we identified the major changes in betalains biosynthesis pathway in diploid and polyploid pitaya. Moreover, the higher genetic expression of SmeADH1 [Chr11, Compartment A (135400000 - 135500000), genes inside the TAD region (135480000 - 135520000)], and lower expression of HuDOPA [Chr11, Compartment A (87100000 - 87200000), genes inside the TAD region (87160000-87200000)] acts as a key regulator of yellow and red color on the pericarp of polyploid and diploid pitaya, respectively. In addition, higher expression of HuCYP76AD1 genes in diploid pitaya and lower expression of SmeCYP76AD1 in polyploid pitaya potentially created the difference in the oxidase process that led to the production of betacyanin and betaxanthin, respectively. Furthermore, our results revealed not only the type of motifs that play a potential role in trait patterning but we also further uncovered that motif count in TAD-boundaries may impact the gene expression within the TAD regions of diploid and polyploid pitaya. Our valuable genomic resource and comparison of 3D euchromatin architecture of diploid and polyploid pitaya species will not only aid in the advancement of molecular breeding efforts but also offer insights into the organization of genomes, SVs, compartmentalization (A and B), and TADs, which have the potential to strengthen the idea of TADs-based trait improvement to achieve global food security.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Hundreds of Variant Impact Predictors (VIPs), also known as Variant Effect Predictors (VEPs), have been developed for this purpose, with a variety of methodologies and goals. To facilitate the exploration of available VIP options, we have created the Variant Impact Predictor database (VIPdb). Results: The Variant Impact Predictor database (VIPdb) version 2 presents a collection of VIPs developed over the past 25 years, summarizing their characteristics, ClinGen calibrated scores, CAGI assessment results, publication details, access information, and citation patterns. We previously summarized 217 VIPs and their features in VIPdb in 2019. Building upon this foundation, we identified and categorized an additional 186 VIPs, resulting in a total of 403 VIPs in VIPdb version 2. The majority of the VIPs have the capacity to predict the impacts of single nucleotide variants and nonsynonymous variants. More VIPs tailored to predict the impacts of insertions and deletions have been developed since the 2010s. In contrast, relatively few VIPs are dedicated to the prediction of splicing, structural, synonymous, and regulatory variants. The increasing rate of citations to VIPs reflects the ongoing growth in their use, and the evolving trends in citations reveal development in the field and individual methods. Conclusions: VIPdb version 2 summarizes 403 VIPs and their features, potentially facilitating VIP exploration for various variant interpretation applications.

Urban greenspaces are important ecosystems that can conserve biodiversity and help offset the carbon footprint of urban areas. However, despite large-scale tree planting and restoration initiatives in cities, it is not well known where trees or vegetation should be planted or restored to achieve multiple benefits. We considered urban greenspaces as nature-based solutions for urban climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation planning. Using bivariate mapping, we examined the spatial synergies and trade-offs between bird functional diversity and carbon storage in ten Canadian cities spanning a gradient of geography and population, and modelled the relationships between vegetation attributes and both bird diversity and amount of carbon. We found carbon and biodiversity are weakly positively correlated across the ten cities, however, this relationship varied in strength, direction and significance. Our maps highlight areas within our target cities where greenspaces could be managed, restored, or protected to maximize carbon storage and conserve biodiversity. Nationwide, our results also show that forest management strategies that promote increases in canopy cover and the proportion of needle-leaved species in urban greenspaces are potential win-win strategies for biodiversity and carbon. Our study shows NbS strategies are not always generalizable across regions. National policies should guide municipalities and cities using regional priorities and science advice, since a NbS promoting biodiversity in one region may, in fact, reduce it in another.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Increasing evidence suggests that solitary bees rely upon pollen provision microbes for successful development. The effects of heat stress on provision microbiota and resulting consequences for larval health and development, however, remain to be examined. We performed an in vitro study to investigate the effects of thermal environment on provision microbiome composition and measured fitness outcomes for Osmia lignaria larvae. Elevated temperatures moderately increased the mean rank relative abundance of Arsenophonus, a putative son-killing symbiont. While pollen sterilization removed Arsenophonus from microbe-rich provisions, larval survivorship did not significantly differ between bees reared on microbe-rich and sterile diets. In contrast to previous research in solitary bees, larvae reared on sterile provisions weighed more and had higher total fat contents, with temperature moderating the degree of difference. As anticipated, we observed a negative relationship between the duration of larval development and temperature. Our results indicated that an intact provision microbiota may not always improve bee fitness, and that bee-microbe interactions during larval development may contribute to the size-shrinking effect observed for cavity-nesting bees under warming conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Notably, these include gastrointestinal dysfunction and alterations in the commensal microbiota in both patients and mouse models, which have been suggested to contribute to secondary infection and poor outcome following stroke. Strikingly changes in commensal microbial community composition occur rapidly in both humans and animal models following stroke and correlate with disease severity. Despite these observations the underpinning mechanisms that drive alterations in the microbiota post-stroke remain poorly understood. The gastrointestinal tract is home to a complex network of tissue-resident immune cells that act constitutively to maintain microbial community and prevent bacterial-driven inflammation. Here we demonstrate that mice subjected to ischaemic stroke exhibit alterations in the intestinal immune system, most notably in antibody secreting B cells and the production of Immunoglobulin A (IgA); a major effector response against commensal microbes. Mice lacking secretory IgA binding to commensal bacteria exhibit a partial reversion of stroke-induced changes in microbiota composition. Notably we also report increases in B cell and IgA-producing plasma cell frequencies in the brain and meninges following stroke. Together these findings demonstrate stroke is associated with perturbations in antibody producing immune responses both in mucosal tissues and the CNS following stroke, which in part explain stroke-induced changes in the intestinal microbiota. A mechanistic understanding of the immunological basis of stroke-associated pathologies in the periphery may open new avenues to manage the secondary complications and long-term prognosis of patients suffering from neurological disease.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Insufficient abundance of energy carriers -as caused by the additional burden of artificial genetic circuits-shifts a cells priority to survival, also harming the functionality of the genetic circuit. Moreover, recent works have shown the importance of energy expenditure in information transmission. Despite living organisms being non-equilibrium systems, non-equilibrium models capable of accounting for energy dissipation and non-equilibrium response curves are not yet employed in genetic design automation (GDA) software. To this end, we introduce Energy Aware Technology Mapping, the automated design of genetic logic circuits with respect to energy efficiency and functionality. The basis for this is an energy aware non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) model of gene expression, capturing characteristics like energy dissipation -which we link to the entropy production rate- and transcriptional bursting, relevant to eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes. Our evaluation shows that a genetic logic circuits functional performance and energy efficiency are disjoint optimization goals. For our benchmark, energy efficiency improves by 37.2% on average when comparing to functionally optimized variants. We discover a linear increase in energy expenditure and overall protein expression with the circuit size, where Energy Aware Technology Mapping allows for designing genetic logic circuits with the energy efficiency of circuits that are one to two gates smaller. Structural variants improve this further, while results show the Pareto dominance among structures of a single Boolean function. By incorporating energy demand into the design, Energy Aware Technology Mapping enables energy efficiency by design. This extends current GDA tools and complements approaches coping with burden in vivo.

Previous studies indicate that this is likely due to some form of indirect assortative mating but there is not a consistent understanding of this process. Understanding indirect assortment is crucial for correctly adjusting for assortative mating, and for understanding intergenerational transmission. We attribute previous inconsistencies to idiosyncratic models and inconsistent use of relevant terms. In this paper, we develop a new framework for understanding indirect assortative mating and provide updated definitions of key terms. We then develop a model (the iAM-ACE-model) that can use partners of twins and siblings to distinguish the degree of assortment on genetic, social, and individual characteristics. We also expand this model to include children of twins and siblings (the iAM-COTS model), allowing us to explain parent-offspring similarity while accounting for indirect assortative mating and gene-environment correlations. We apply the models on educational attainment using 1,529,144 individuals in 209,792 extended families from Norwegian registry data and the Norwegian Twin Registry. The analysis suggests that partners correlate .67 (95% CIs: .66, .70) on a latent sorting factor associated with educational attainment, which we estimate to be about 30% (26%, 35%) heritable, 42% (37%, 47%) sibling-shared environment, 8% (4%, 13%) twin-shared environment, 17% (16%, 19%) gene-environment correlations, and 3% (2%, 5%) non-shared environment. The implied genotypic correlation between partners (r = .33) is comparable to earlier studies, and higher than expected under direct assortment. Most of the parent-offspring correlation (r = .33) was attributable to passive genetic transmission (62%), with the rest attributable to passive environmental transmission (23%) and direct phenotypic transmission (15%). Environmental transmission was estimated lower in alternative models that assumed direct assortment, but these did not fit the data well.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

The general premise of these methods is to propagate phage on multiple bacterial hosts, pool the lysate, and repeat the propagation process until phage(s) can form plaques on the target host(s). In theory, this propagation process produces a phage lysate that contains input phages and their evolved phage progeny. However, in practice, this phage lysate can also include prophages originating from bacterial hosts. Here we describe our experience implementing one directed evolution method, the Appelmans protocol, to study phage evolution in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage-host system, in which we observed rapid host-range expansion of the phage cocktail. Further experimentation and sequencing analysis revealed that this observed host-range expansion was due to a Casadabanvirus prophage that originated from one of the Appelmans hosts. Host-range analysis of the prophage showed that it could infect five of eight bacterial hosts initially used, allowing it to proliferate and persist through the end of the experiment. This prophage was represented in half of the sequenced phage samples isolated from the Appelmans experiment. This work highlights the impact of prophages in directed evolution experiments and the importance of incorporating sequencing data in analyses to verify output phages, particularly for those attempting to procure phages intended for phage therapy applications. This study also notes the usefulness of intraspecies antagonism assays between bacterial host strains to establish a baseline for inhibitory activity and determine presence of prophage.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

We, therefore, aimed to elucidate the effects of opioids, antiepileptics, and antidepressants on common rsEEG biomarker candidates of chronic pain. To this end, we analyzed two large, independent rsEEG datasets, including 220 people with chronic pain. We performed preregistered multivariate Bayesian analyses and controlled for the potential confounds of age, pain intensity, and depression. The results predominantly provided evidence against effects of centrally acting analgesics on peak alpha frequency, oscillatory power in different frequency bands, and connectivity-based network measures. Although these findings do not rule out any effects of analgesics on rsEEG, they argue against medium to large effects of centrally acting analgesics on rsEEG. Thus, the findings strengthen the validity of rsEEG biomarker candidates of chronic pain and might thereby help to develop clinically valuable biomarkers of chronic pain.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

The viruses are carried by large fractions of the human population and can integrate into the human genome, leading to a wide range of clinical manifestations of varied severity. Here, we present the first nine full and two partial ancient genomes of HHV-6A and 6B, dating as far back as the Italian Iron Age (ca. 1100-600 BCE). We demonstrate that large fractions of the current HHV-6 diversity were already well established in the human population by the 14th century CE. Our data suggests that HHV-6B integrated into the human genome at the latest before the 1st-6th century CE, with two integrated clades being populated by ancient DNA genomes in our phylogeny, which further supports that they originated from likely much older ancient founder events. Additionally, we show that all known inherited chromosomally integrated (ici-)HHV-6A clades were already represented in European historical populations, confirming that ici-HHV-6A no longer integrates into the human germline within populations of European ancestry and likely endogenized in early human history.

Here, we provide causal evidence that transcranial magnetic stimulation to human V1 disrupted the fidelity of visual working memory. Magnetic stimulation during the retention interval of a visuospatial working memory task caused a systematic increase in memory errors. Errors increased only for targets that were remembered in the portion of the visual field disrupted by stimulation, and were invariant to when in the delay stimulation was applied. Moreover, concurrently measured electroencephalography confirmed that stimulation disrupted not only memory behavior, but a standard neurophysiological signature of working memory. These results change the question from whether V1 is necessary for working memory into what mechanisms does V1 use to support memory. Moreover, they point to models in which the mechanisms supporting working memory are distributed across brain regions, including sensory areas that here we show are critical for memory storage.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

We included 1,864,637 children and adolescents under 21 from 19 childrens hospitals and health institutions in the US with at least six months of follow-up time between March 2020 and May 2023. We divided the patients into three strata: patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) during the acute phase (within 28 days) of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and patients without pre-existing CKD or AKI. We defined a set of adverse kidney outcomes for each stratum and examined the outcomes within the post-acute and chronic phases after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In each stratum, compared with the non-infected group, patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes. For patients without pre-existing CKD, there were increased risks of CKD stage 2+ (HR 1.20; 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) and CKD stage 3+ (HR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.15-1.59) during the post-acute phase (28 days to 365 days) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, children and adolescents with pre-existing CKD and those who experienced AKI were at increased risk of progression to a composite outcome defined by at least 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2, End Stage Kidney Disease diagnosis, dialysis, or transplant.

Lay abstractThis study examined the impact of COVID-19 on kidney health in children and adolescents under 21 years old in the United States. Using data from the RECOVER program, we analyzed the health records of 1,864,637 young individuals from 19 hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and May 2023. The study focused on three groups: those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), those who experienced acute kidney injury (AKI) during the initial COVID-19 infection, and those without any prior kidney issues. The results showed that children and adolescents who had COVID-19 were at a higher risk of developing serious kidney problems later on, even if they had no previous kidney conditions. This research highlights the long-term effects of COVID-19 on kidney health in young people and underscores the importance of monitoring kidney function in pediatric COVID-19 patients.","NA","medrxiv",1719785247128

So far, large-scale microbiome studies either miss functional information or consistency in sample processing, and although they may cover thousands of locations, these are missing resolution, sparsely located, or lacking metadata. Here, we present Microflora Danica, an atlas of Danish environmental microbiomes, encompassing 10,686 shotgun metagenomes and 449 full-length 16S and 18S rRNA datasets linked to a detailed 5 level habitat classification scheme. We determine that while human-disturbed habitats have high alpha diversity, the same species reoccur, revealing hidden homogeneity and underlining the importance of natural systems for total species (gamma) diversity. In-depth studies of nitrifiers, a functional group closely linked to climate change, challenge existing perceptions regarding habitat preference and discover several novel nitrifiers as more abundant than canonical nitrifiers.

Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells preferred noun.

Although a few natural products have been shown to protect bacteria from phage infection, the prevalence and diversity of chemical anti-phage defense remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a novel family of over 2000 lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters from Actinobacteria that participate in anti-phage defense, which we named lanthiphages. Lanthiphages colocalize with other anti-phage systems in defense islands. We demonstrate that native lanthiphage expression protects the model strain Streptomyces coelicolor against diverse phages. Heterologous expression of four additional lanthiphage pathways shows that the anti-phage function is conserved across this family of biosynthetic gene clusters. Finally, we demonstrate that lanthiphage expression leads to the production of a novel compound and alters phage transcription. Our findings highlight that biosynthetic gene clusters with anti-phage functions can be successfully identified through genomic analysis.

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

Utilizing the scattering properties of ZnO nanoparticles, we developed a flow cytometry based sorting methodology and identified thirteen proteins with ZnO binding interfaces. Three designs promoted ZnO nucleation under conditions where traditional inorganic binding peptides and control proteins were ineffective. Incorporation of these interfaces into higher order assemblies further enhanced nucleation.

Most of these proteins are synthesized with N-terminal presequences which serve as mitochondrial targeting signals. Presequences consistently form amphipathic helices, but they considerably differ in respect to their primary structure and length. Here we show that presequences can be classified into seven different groups based on their specific features. Using a test set of different presequences, we observed that group A presequences endow precursor proteins with improved in vitro import characteristics. We developed IQ-Compete (for Import and de-Quenching Competition assay), a novel assay based on fluorescence de-quenching, to monitor the import efficiencies of mitochondrial precursors in vivo. With this assay, we confirmed the increased import competence of group A presequences. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the presequence of the group A protein Oxa1 specifically recruits the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) containing protein TOMM34 to the cytosolic precursor protein. TOMM34 apparently serves as a presequence-specific targeting factor which increases the import efficiency of a specific subset of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Our results suggest that presequences contain a protein-specific priority code that encrypts the targeting mechanism of individual mitochondrial precursor proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

However, the translational activity of single 80S ribosomes (monosomes) on mRNA is less well understood, even though these 80S monosomes represent the dominant ribosomal complexes in vivo. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine the translational activity of 80S monosomes across different tissues in Drosophila melanogaster. We discovered that while head and embryo 80S monosomes are highly translationally active, testis and ovary 80S monosomes are translationally inactive. RNA-Seq analysis of head monosome- and polysome-translated mRNAs, revealed that head 80S monosomes preferentially translate mRNAs with TOP motifs, short 5-UTRs, short ORFs and are enriched for uORFs. Overall, these findings highlight that regulation of translation initiation, and that protein synthesis is mostly performed by monosomes in head and embryo, whilst polysomes are the main source of protein production in testis and ovary.

Here, we introduce the R package to the RTF approach, which has originally been implemented within the MATLAB-based Data2Dynamics modelling framework. The package enables modelling of time and dose dependencies and includes model reduction to minimize overfitting. It can be applied not only to experimental data but also to trajectories of ODE models, to characterize the dynamics or to identify major targets of experimental perturbations in the low-dimensional representations calculated by the package.

Our PlantRNA-FM is empowered by our interpretable framework that facilitates the identification of biologically functional RNA sequence and structure motifs, including both RNA secondary and tertiary structure motifs across transcriptomes. Through experimental validations, we revealed novel translation-associated RNA motifs in plants. Our PlantRNA-FM also highlighted the importance of the position information of these functional RNA motifs in genic regions. Taken together, our PlantRNA-FM facilitates the exploration of functional RNA motifs across the complexity of transcriptomes, empowering plant scientists with novel capabilities for programming RNA codes in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

These processes occur over timescales which range from milliseconds to days. While various strategies exist to study integrin function across biological scales from cell to tissue, they are often chronic and fail to target specific cell-cell interactions acutely. We engineered cells to rapidly alter cell behavior by downregulating the surface population of 5{beta}1 integrins through hot-wired clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This method allows for inducible, specific internalization of 5{beta}1 integrins, achieving acute downregulation across various cell lines in 5-30 minutes. We show that induced internalization of 5{beta}1 decreases the cell area, causes uptake of extracellular fibronectin, and decreases the rate of tumor spheroid compaction. This targeted control of multiscale processes by rapid downregulation of this important class of cell surface receptors demonstrates that hot-wired endocytosis is a useful tool to acutely modulate cell biology.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Human genetic studies established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration2. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from patient brains1. All diseases studied to date have been characterised by the self-assembly of a single intracellular protein in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) Types A and B3,4. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP Type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/284-N345 and ANXA11 residues L39-L74 from their respective low-complexity domains (LCDs). Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11 previously implicated in protein-protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as a [~]22 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections confirmed the co-localisation of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP Type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP Type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Actinoporins are a family of -pore-forming proteins that bind specifically to sphingomyelin-containing lipid membranes, where they oligomerize and form transmembrane pores. The numerous contacts they form with the lipid membrane make them an exemplary object for studying the different roles that lipids play in the structure and function of membrane proteins. Through a comprehensive cryo-electron microscopic analysis of a pore formed by an actinoporin Fav from the coral Orbicella faveolata, we show that the octameric pore interacts with 112 lipids in the upper leaflet of the membrane. The structures of Fav pores formed on different lipid membranes reveal the different roles of lipids and demonstrate that the actinoporin surface is perfectly suited for binding multiple receptor sphingomyelin molecules. When cholesterol is present in the membrane, it forms nanodomains associated with the pore, leading to a tighter arrangement of lipids, which in turn increases the stability of the pores. Atomistic simulations support the structural data, show that the protein-bound lipids are not mobile, and reveal additional effects of the pore on the lipid membrane. Overall, these data reveal a complex network of protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions, and an underrated role of lipids in the structure and function of transmembrane protein complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Here, we use a long-term experiment to examine how excluding herbivores, a proxy for biodiversity loss, restructures dominant plant ecological strategies within and across species.

2) We measured twelve functional traits of four dominant annual plant species in the semi-arid shrublands of Chile. We evaluated changes in trait distributions within and across species and changes in the coordination between above- and below-ground strategies in response to vertebrate herbivore exclusion.

3) Our study reveals three dominant ecological strategies characterizing trait variation within and across species, with an increase in the coordination between above- and below-ground strategies in the presence of herbivores. Our results show that herbivores induce shifts in ecological strategies, leading to conservative resource use, increased herbivore tolerance, reduced collaboration with soil microorganisms, and greater intraspecific diversity, facilitating species coexistence.

4) We empirically demonstrate how herbivores shape ecological strategies within and across species, and demonstrate that the absence of herbivores alters the diversity of adaptation strategies of plants and leads to a decoupling of resource acquisition strategies above- and below-ground. These results advance understanding of annual plant responses to herbivore loss.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

We sought to identify master regulators of host immune responses that determine disease severity in pulmonary TB. We performed molecular profiling of human in vivo immune responses to discover associations with the extent of radiographic TB disease in a patient cohort. We then undertook mechanistic studies to test causality for the observed associations using the zebrafish larval Mycobacterium marinum infection model. Transcriptional profiling of human immune recall responses to tuberculin skin test (TST) challenge, a surrogate for immune responses to TB in the lung, revealed that type I interferon activity in the TST transcriptome was inversely associated with radiological disease severity. Abrogation of type I interferon signalling, achieved by CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of stat2, led to increased susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to M. marinum infection, as a result of reduced recruitment of myeloid cells required to restrict mycobacterial growth, to the site of disease. Our data support a host protective role for type I interferon responses in mycobacterial infection, with potential applications for risk-stratification of adverse outcomes and development of a host-directed therapy to mitigate against severe disease.

We develop an inference framework to test existing population genetics models based on the joint distribution of allelic effect sizes and frequencies of trait-associated variants. A majority of traits have GWAS results that are inconsistent with neutral evolution or long-term directional selection (selection against a trait or against disease risk). Instead, we find that most traits show consistency with stabilizing selection, which acts to preserve an intermediate trait value or disease risk. Our observations also suggest that selection may reflect pleiotropy, with each variant influenced by associations with multiple selected traits.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment is designed to improve yield of low abundance sequences but has not been thoroughly explored with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) for use in clinical bacterial epidemiology. We designed CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs to enrich for the human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae, by targeting multi-locus sequence type (MLST) and transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, as well as common antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and the resistance-associated integron gene intI1. We validated enrichment performance in bacterial isolates before comparing enriched and unenriched sequencing of three human faecal samples spiked with K. pneumoniae at varying abundance. Enriched sequencing generated 56x and 11.3x the number of AMR and MLST reads respectively compared to unenriched sequencing and required approximately one third of the computational storage space. Targeting the intI1 gene often led to detection of 10-20 proximal resistance genes due to the long reads produced by ONT sequencing. We demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment combined with ONT sequencing enabled improved genomic characterisation outcomes over unenriched sequencing of patient samples. This method could be used to inform infection control strategies by identifying patients colonised with high-risk strains.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Student females selected the same male genotype that a teacher female mated at higher frequently than expected by chance. Chemical mate choice copying requires sensing both male and female cues, which might indicate that that male genotype has been chosen by other females.

Besides attentional state, lower heart-rate predicted decreased vigilance and pupil size, while heart-rate variability predicted more impulsive behaviour and pupil dilation. Together, these findings reveal that cardiac parameters afford complementary information about arousal states and attentional dynamics, illustrating the complexity of task disengagement from a cognitive and physiological perspective.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

However, compared to other K2P channels, little is known about the structural and functional properties of THIK-1. Here we present a 3.16 [A] resolution cryoEM structure of human THIK-1 that reveals several unique features, in particular, a tyrosine in M4 (Y273) which contributes to a lower  Y-gate that opens upon activation by physiologically-relevant signalling pathways. We further demonstrate that binding of linoleic acid within a modulatory pocket adjacent to the filter also activates THIK-1, and that halothane inhibition involves a binding site within the inner cavity resulting in changes to the Y-gate. Finally, the extracellular cap domain contains positively-charged residues that line the ion exit pathway and which contribute to the unique biophysical properties of this channel. Overall, our results provide important insights into the structural basis of THIK1 function and identify distinct regulatory sites that expand its potential as a drug target for the modulation of microglial function.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

The aging ovary assumes a fibro-inflammatory milieu which negatively impacts gamete quantity and quality as well as ovulation. Here we tested whether the systemic delivery of anti-inflammatory (Etanercept) or anti-fibrotic (Pirfenidone) drugs attenuates ovarian aging in mice. We first evaluated the ability of these drugs to decrease the expression of fibro-inflammatory genes in primary ovarian stromal cells. Whereas Etanercept did not block Tnf expression in ovarian stromal cells, Pirfenidone significantly reduced Col1a1 expression. We then tested Pirfenidone in vivo where the drug was delivered systemically via mini-osmotic pumps for 6-weeks. Pirfenidone mitigated the age-dependent increase in ovarian fibrosis without impacting overall health parameters. Ovarian function was improved in Pirfenidone-treated mice as evidenced by increased follicle and corpora lutea number, AMH levels, and improved estrous cyclicity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Pirfenidone treatment resulted in an upregulation of reproductive function-related genes at 8.5 months and a downregulation of inflammatory genes at 12 months of age. These findings demonstrate that reducing the fibroinflammatory ovarian microenvironment improves ovarian function, thereby supporting modulating the ovarian environment as a therapeutic avenue to extend reproductive longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

Compartmentalized ordered membrane domains enriched with specific lipids, often termed lipid rafts, have been shown to modulate the physicochemical and mechanical properties of membranes and to drive protein sorting. Novel methods and tools enabling the visualization, characterization and/or manipulation of membrane compartmentalization are crucial to link the properties of the membrane with cell functions. Flipper, a commercially-available fluorescent membrane tension probe, has become a reference tool for quantitative membrane tension studies in living cells. Here, we report on a so far unidentified property of Flipper, namely, its ability to photosensitize singlet oxygen (1O2) under blue light when embedded into lipid membranes. This in turn results in the production of lipid hydroperoxides that increase membrane tension and trigger phase separation. In biological membranes, the photo-induced segregated domains retain the sorting ability of intact phase-separated membranes, directing raft and non-raft proteins into ordered and disordered regions, respectively, in contrast to radical-based photo-oxidation reactions that disrupt raft protein partitioning. The dual tension reporting and photosensitizing abilities of Flipper enable simultaneous visualization and manipulation of the mechanical properties and lateral organization of membranes, providing a powerful tool to optically control lipid raft formation and to explore the interplay between membrane biophysics and cell function.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

SWI/SNF subunits are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. These mutations are often heterozygous loss-of-function alleles, indicating a dosage-sensitive role for SWI/SNF subunits in chromatin regulation. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate SWI/SNF subunit dosage to ensure proper complex assembly remain largely unexplored. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen, using epigenome editing in mouse embryonic stem cells, and identified Mlf2 and Rbm15 as regulators of SWI/SNF complex activity. First, we show that MLF2, a poorly characterized chaperone protein, regulates a subset of SWI/SNF target genes by promoting chromatin remodeling activity. Next, we find that RBM15, part of the m6A RNA methylation writer complex, controls m6A modifications on specific SWI/SNF mRNAs to regulate protein levels of these subunits. Misregulation of m6A methylation causes overexpression of core SWI/SNF subunits leading to the assembly of incomplete complexes lacking the catalytic ATPase/ARP subunits. These data indicate that targeting modulators of SWI/SNF complex assembly may offer a potent therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with impaired chromatin remodeling.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

These events constitute a nationwide trauma with major ramifications for public mental health. This article presents an evidence-based model for the prediction of the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to the terrorist attack and the war.

Main bodyThe creation of the model consisted of several steps. Firstly, the Israeli population was divided into six groups based on the intensity, context, and type of traumatic exposure (direct exposure to terror, close proximity to terror, soldiers in combat and support units, intense exposure to rocket attacks, moderate exposure to rocket attacks, and indirectly affected communities), and the population size of each group was assessed using official national databases. Secondly, an estimation of the expected prevalence of PTSD in each of the exposure groups was based on a review of the relevant literature. A random-effects meta-analysis of the prevalence rates was conducted separately per each exposure group. Finally, the predicted number of PTSD causalities in the population was calculated by multiplying the group size and the PTSD prevalence estimation. Based on population size and estimated PTSD prevalence within each exposure category, the model predicts that approximately 5.3% (N=519,923) of the Israeli population (95% prediction interval, 160,346-879,502), may develop PTSD as a result of the terrorist attack and the war.

ConclusionsThe predicted number of individuals with PTSD following mass trauma is expected to be considerable. The presented model can assist policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in preparing and devising adequate interventions for the mental health needs of large populations. Moreover, this model can be applied in other instances of mass-trauma exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1719785247128

Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

Autism has been associated with atypicalities in integrating audio-visual information, potentially underlying social difficulties in this population. The present study investigated multisensory integration (MSI) in speech processing among autistic (N=35) and neurotypical (N=35) adults. Participants performed a speech-in-noise task in a realistic multispeaker social scenario with audio-visual, auditory, or visual trials while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. The neurotypical group demonstrated a non-linear audio-visual interaction in alpha suppression, whereas the autistic group showed merely additive processing of these same inputs. Despite these differences in neural correlates, both groups achieved similar behavioural audio-visual facilitation outcomes. These findings suggest that although autistic and neurotypical brains might process multisensory cues differently, they achieve comparable benefits from audio-visual speech. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on MSI atypicalities in autism.","NA","medrxiv",1719785247128

These communication patterns can be comprehensively mapped using noninvasive functional imaging, resulting in functional connectivity (FC) networks. Despite its popularity, FC is a statistical construct and its operational definition is arbitrary. While most studies use zero-lag Pearsons correlations by default, there exist hundreds of pairwise interaction statistics in the broader scientific literature that can be used to estimate FC. How the organization of the FC matrix varies with the choice of pairwise statistic is a fundamental methodological question that affects all studies in this rapidly growing field. Here we comprehensively benchmark the topological and geometric organization, neurobiological associations, and cognitive-behavioral relevance of FC matrices computed using a large library of 239 pairwise interaction statistics. We comprehensively investigate how canonical features of FC networks vary with the choice of pairwise statistic, including (1) hub mapping, (2) weight-distance trade-offs, (3) structure-function coupling, (4) correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, (5) individual fingerprinting, and (6) brain-behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Throughout, we observe that measures such as covariance (full correlation), precision (partial correlation) and distance display multiple desirable properties, including close correspondence with structural connectivity, the capacity to differentiate individuals and to predict individual differences in behavior. Using information flow decomposition, we find that differences among FC methods may arise from differential sensitivity to the underlying mechanisms of inter-regional communication, with some more sensitive to redundant and some to synergistic information flow. In summary, our report highlights the importance of tailoring a pairwise statistic to a specific neurophysiological mechanism and research question, providing a blueprint for future studies to optimize their choice of FC method.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719785247128

However, to be included in national NCS inventories, governments must first quantify the kelp-derived carbon stocks and fluxes leading to carbon sequestration. Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1719785247128

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
