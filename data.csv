However, cost and invasiveness preclude EGD in those who have no prior GERD symptoms, despite having other risk factors, representing missed opportunities for BE screening in individuals who account for approximately 40% of the patients who eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate if non-endoscopic methods can enable BE detection in an at-risk population without GERD symptoms.

MethodsPatients presenting for colonoscopy who had not undergone previous EGD plus had [&ge;]3 BE risk factors (from among age >50 years, male sex, white race, smoking history, family history of BE/EAC, or central obesity) without chronic GERD symptoms were prospectively recruited for non-endoscopic screening. Trained nurses administered the EsoCheck (Lucid Diagnostics) encapsulated balloon. Samples were assayed with the EsoGuard BE detection methylated DNA marker panel (Lucid Diagnostics). Patients with a positive result were offered standard-of-care EGD, while patients with a negative EG result were offered free of cost research EGD. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and BE prevalence were calculated.

ResultsThe mean age of the 132 study subjects was 60.7 years, 129 (98%) were white, 124 (94%) were male, 71 (54%) had a prior smoking history, 46 (35%) were centrally obese, and 5 (4%) reported a family history. EsoCheck was successfully administered in 124 (94%) and the EsoGuard methylated DNA marker panel could be assayed in 120 (97%) of the samples. Thirty-four assays were positive of which 27 underwent a follow-up EGD and BE was identified in 9, PPV = 33% [17%, 54%] subjects. EGD was also performed in 22 of the 86 subjects whose assays were negative and none of them had BE, NPV = 100% [85%, 100%]. A logistic regression model fitted to impute the presence of BE estimated the PPV as 27% [13%, 44%], NPV as 98% [92%, 100%], and BE prevalence as 8.4% [4.5%, 14.3%].

ConclusionPatients without chronic GERD who have [&ge;]3 BE risk factors have a moderately high prevalence of BE. Non-endoscopic detection can effectively identify BE, enabling expansion of screening to this larger at-risk population. Those with a negative EG assay have a low likelihood of BE.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

South Africa is unique in the region because its HIV programme is largely domestically funded, although donor funds and partnerships support key components. We estimated the epidemiological impact of ceased PEPFAR support for specific services and the costs and cost-effectiveness of the South African government (SAG) potentially taking over these services.

MethodsWe used a costed version of Thembisa, a South African HIV transmission model, to simulate four scenarios: a minimum scenario assuming intervention coverage reducing proportional to PEPFARs funding share of specific activities in 2023; a maximum scenario assuming additional health system impacts; and sub-scenarios either with 3-year recovery (2029-2031) or no recovery to previous coverage. HIV programme costs were estimated from the provider perspective (SAG) in 2024/25 US dollars.

ResultsOver 2025-2028, discontinuing PEPFAR funding in South Africa without replacement by SAG would result in 150,000-296,000 additional new HIV infections (29-56% increase) and 56,000-65,000 additional AIDS-related deaths (33-38%). Permanent discontinuation of currently PEPFAR-supported services over the next 20 years increases this to 1.1-2.1 million additional new HIV infections and 519,000-712,000 additional AIDS deaths. To sustain services, SAG needs to spend an additional $710 million to $1.5 billion between 2025 and 2028. Under a reduced budget, the most cost-effective interventions to preserve are ART and PrEP.

ConclusionUnmanaged PEPFAR exit from South Africa threatens to undo a decade of progress towards ending AIDS as a public health threat unless services are taken over by other funders, including SAG.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

The first line of treatment for MDD is antidepressant medication that enhances signaling by monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine. Other treatments include non-pharmaceutical treatments, such as electroconvulsive therapy and transmagnetic stimulation, and non-traditional pharmaceutical antidepressants that function via alternative, often unknown, mechanisms. Methods: To identify mechanisms of action shared across antidepressant categories, we examined changes in gene expression following treatment with both traditional and non-traditional antidepressants, using a meta-analysis of public transcriptional profiling data from laboratory rodents (rats, mice). We focused on the hippocampus, which is a brain region that is well-documented via neuro-imaging to show morphological changes in depression that reverse with antidepressant usage. We specifically focused on treatment during adulthood, and included both clinically-used antidepressants (both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) and treatments demonstrated to effectively treat depressive mood symptoms. The outcome variable was gene expression in bulk dissected hippocampus as measured by microarray or RNA-Seq. To conduct our project, we systematically reviewed available datasets in the Gemma database of curated, reprocessed transcriptional profiling data using pre-defined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria. We identified 15 relevant studies containing a total of 22 antidepressant vs. control group comparisons (collective n=352). For each gene, a random effects meta-analysis model was then fit to the antidepressant vs. control effect sizes (Log2 Fold Changes) extracted from each study. Results: Our meta-analysis yielded stable estimates for 16,439 genes, identifying 58 genes that were consistently differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate<0.05) across antidepressant experiments and categories. Of these genes, 23 were upregulated and 35 were downregulated. The functions associated with the differentially expressed genes were diverse, including modulation of the stress response, immune regulation, neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. Conclusion: The genes that we identified as consistently differentially expressed across antidepressant categories may be worth investigating as potential linchpins for antidepressant efficacy or as targets for novel therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1745532509008

Such algorithms to predict essential functional and structural features remain out of reach for biomolecular. Here, we report quantitative and qualitative evaluation of nucleic acid structures for the CASP16 blind prediction challenge by 12 of the experimental groups who provided nucleic acid targets. Blind predictions accurately model secondary structure and some aspects of tertiary structure, including reasonable global folds for some complex RNAs, however, predictions often lack accuracy in the regions of highest functional importance. All models have inaccuracies in non-canonical regions where, e.g., the nucleic-acid backbone bends or a base forms a non-standard hydrogen bond. These bends and non-canonical interactions are integral to form functionally important regions such as RNA enzymatic active sites. Additionally, the modeling of conserved and functional interfaces between nucleic acids and ligands, proteins, or other nucleic acids remains poor. For some targets, the experimental structures may not represent the only structure the biomolecular complex occupies in solution or in its functional life-cycle, posing a future challenge for the community.","NA","biorxiv",1745532509008

Vaccination is a vital tool in preventing acute COVID-19 and may confer additional protection against Long COVID. There is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing of COVID-19 vaccination (i.e., vaccination schedule) to minimize the risk of Long COVID. Methods: We applied Longitudinal Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation to electronic health record (EHR) data from a retrospective cohort of patients vaccinated against COVID-19 between December 2021 and September 2022. We evaluated the association between binary COVID-19 vaccination status (two or more doses vs. zero doses) and 12-month Long COVID risk among patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 between December 2021 and September 2022. In addition, we compared the 12-month cumulative risk of Long COVID (ICD-10 code U09.9) among patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 one to three months after vaccination, three to five months after vaccination, or five to seven months after vaccination while adjusting for relevant high-dimensional baseline and time-dependent covariates. Results: We analyzed EHR data from a retrospective cohort of 1,558,018 patients. In our binary cohort (n = 519,980), we found that vaccinated patients had a lower risk of Long COVID than unvaccinated patients (adjusted marginal risk ratio 0.84 (0.81, 0.88)). In our longitudinal cohort (n = 1,085,291), we did not find a significant difference in Long COVID risk comparing patients who were diagnosed with acute COVID-19 one to three months after vaccination versus patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 three to five months (adjusted marginal risk ratio 0.93 (95% CI 0.62, 1.41) or 5 to 7 months (adjusted marginal risk ratio 1.06 (95% CI 0.72, 1.56)) after vaccination. Conclusions: We found that COVID-19 vaccination before SARS-CoV-2 infection was protective against Long COVID, and we did not find that this protection significantly waned within 7 months after vaccination. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination protects against Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

Established theories, such as kin selection, group selection, and reciprocal altruism, explain altruism via assortment mechanisms that depend on preferential interactions among altruists to ensure a higher average payoff than selfish individuals. Hamilton's rule defines the minimum level of such assortative interactions required for altruism to evolve. However, in populations with limited growth, increased competition can erode the selective advantage of altruism and thus require more stringent Hamilton's rule. Here, we propose a fundamentally different mechanism: fluctuating selection driven by increased competition due to added social benefits of altruism in populations with limited carrying capacity. Under fluctuating selection, altruists can invade a selfish population without the need of assortment mechanisms and outcompete selfish individuals through a transient phase, even when the cost of altruism exceeds its direct benefit. Classical invasion analysis, which compares the long-term growth rates of rare altruistic mutants and resident selfish individuals, fails in our model because both strategies exhibit zero long-term growth. Instead, we show that altruism can invade when its short-term, time-averaging growth rate exceeds that of selfish individuals, which necessitates a prolonged transient phase. This invasion is enabled by payoff-regulated density dependence, which captures the dynamic interplay between payoff and density on fitness under fluctuating selection. Our findings challenge the necessity of Hamilton's rule and show that genuine altruism, with less average payoff than selfish individuals, even extremely self-sacrificial, can emerge under natural selection. This suggests that altruism may arise not from preferential interaction, but as an adaptive response to population fluctuations in constrained environments, providing an alternative paradigm for understanding the evolution of altruistic behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1745532509008

The overlap with and dissociation from domain-general executive control in the frontal lobe remains contentious. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the functional relevance of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) for semantic and executive control. Across four sessions, 24 participants received 1 Hz repetitive TMS to each region individually, dual-site TMS targeting both regions sequentially (IFG followed by pre-SMA), and sham TMS. Participants then completed semantic fluency, figural fluency, and picture-naming tasks. Stimulation of either region broadly disrupted both semantic and figural fluency, suggesting shared functionality. However, electric field modeling of the induced stimulation strength revealed distinct specializations: The left IFG was primarily associated with semantic control, as evidenced by verbal fluency deficits, while the pre-SMA played a domain-general role in executive functions, affecting non-verbal fluency and cognitive flexibility (e.g., clustering and switching during semantic fluency). Notably, only dual-site TMS impaired accuracy in figural fluency, providing unique evidence for successful compensation of executive functions through either the left IFG or pre-SMA following single-site perturbation. These findings underscore the multidimensionality of cognitive control and suggest a flexible task-dependent contribution of the IFG to control processes, either as semantic-specific or general executive resource. Furthermore, they highlight the tightly interconnected network of executive control subserved by the left IFG and pre-SMA, advancing our understanding of the neural basis of semantic and executive functions.","NA","biorxiv",1745532509008

To address this gap, we present a long-range massively parallel reporter assay (long-range MPRA), an assay allowing the measurement of hundreds of enhancers at multiple distances from a genome-integrated promoter. The long-range MPRA assay features two independent landing pads, allowing modular control over the genome-integrated promoter and enhancer libraries. We showcased the capability of long-range MPRA by testing over 300 K562 enhancers, as well as a set of enhancer combinations, at distances up to 100 kb. We found that enhancers long-range activities are primarily determined by their intrinsic strength, with strong enhancers retaining more activity over long distances, while weak enhancers rapidly lose activity. Additionally, we found that GATA1-bound enhancers are more resistant to distance-dependent loss of activity, suggesting that TF binding also modulates long-range function. Finally, testing long-range enhancer activities with three different promoters (HBE, HBG and GAPDH) revealed that long-range enhancer-promoter interactions rely on not only enhancer properties but also promoter responsiveness.","NA","biorxiv",1745532509008

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

To define a set of candidate loci with potentially pleiotropic associations, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of up to 1,167 clinically relevant traits and diseases across 1,789,365 diverse individuals genetically similar to Admixed American (AMR, NMax = 60,756), African (AFR, NMax = 128,361), East Asian (EAS, NMax = 307,465), European (EUR, NMax = 1,283,907), and South Asian (SAS, NMax = 8,876) reference populations from the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP), UK Biobank (UKB), FinnGen, Biobank Japan (BBJ), Tohoku Medical Megabank (ToMMO), and Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). We identified 27,193 genome-wide significant locus-trait pairs (1MB region with PGWAMA < 5 x 10-8) in within-population analysis and 29,139 in multi-population analysis (PMR-MEGA < 5 x 10-8). Among these, 11.5% (n = 3,149) of locus-trait pairs in population-wise and 6.4% (n = 1,875) in multi-population analyses did not reach genome-wide significance in previously published GWAS. In aggregate, the genome-wide significant loci fell within 2,624 non-overlapping autosomal genomic windows on average [~]600kb in size. Each locus contained genome-wide significant signals for a median of 6 traits (IQR 2 to 18), including 2,110 (80%) pleiotropic loci associated with >1 trait. Multi-trait colocalization identified 1,902 (72%) loci with high-confidence (posterior probability > 0.9) evidence of a shared causal variant across two or more traits. Variants in pleiotropic loci were significantly enriched for a broad spectrum of functional annotations compared to non-pleiotropic counterparts. Polygenic scores (PGS) developed from these data generally improved prediction compared to existing PGS and were broadly associated with both on- and off-target phenotypes. These results provide a contemporary map of genetic pleiotropy across the spectrum of human traits/diseases and genetic backgrounds.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

However, the lack of scalable and efficient methods to integrate large-scale multi-omics data limits deeper insights into xQTL regulation. Here, we propose ColocBoost, a multi-task learning colocalization method that can scale to hundreds of traits, while accounting for multiple causal variants within a genomic region of interest. ColocBoost employs a specialized gradient boosting framework that can adaptively couple colocalized traits while performing causal variant selection, thereby enhancing the detection of weaker shared signals compared to existing pairwise and multi-trait colocalization methods. We applied ColocBoost genome-wide to 17 gene-level single-nucleus and bulk xQTL data from the aging brain cortex of ROSMAP individuals (average N = 595), encompassing 6 cell types, 3 brain regions and 3 molecular modalities (expression, splicing, and protein abundance). Across molecular xQTLs, ColocBoost identified 16,503 distinct colocalization events, exhibiting 10.7({+/-}0.74)-fold enrichment for heritability across 57 complex diseases/traits and showing strong concordance with element-gene pairs validated by CRISPR screening assays. When colocalized against Alzheimers disease (AD) GWAS, ColocBoost identified up to 2.5-fold more distinct colocalized loci, explaining twice the AD disease heritability compared to fine-mapping without xQTL integration. This improvement is largely attributable to ColocBoosts enhanced sensitivity in detecting gene-distal colocalizations, as supported by strong concordance with known enhancer-gene links, highlighting its ability to identify biologically plausible AD susceptibility loci with underlying regulatory mechanisms. Notably, several genes including BLNK and CTSH showed sub-threshold associations in GWAS, but were identified through multi-omics colocalizations which provide new functional support for their involvement in AD pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

Circulating biomarkers have the potential to identify patients with primary resistance or early progression on therapy to alter treatment course and avoid unnecessary toxicity. Unbiased multimodal proteomic profiling in blood has been underexplored due to the previously limited scalability of multiplexing technologies or cohorts lacking time-series sampling. To address this, we performed plasma proteomic profiling of >2,900 proteins and high-dimensional mass cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocytes across serial time points in 250 metastatic melanoma patients on ICB treatment. We further obtained 92 patient-matched tumor samples, which were processed for single-cell and/or bulk RNA sequencing. Proteins upregulated post-ICB were associated with inflammatory pathways involving the activation of effector immune functions. Expression of genes corresponding to these proteins was higher in immune cells involved in recruitment and tumor reactivity. Expression of genes corresponding to plasma proteins more abundant in non-responders was highest in suppressive myeloid subsets and malignant cells. We further posit the involvement of these non-responder genes in immunosuppressive and pro-tumor interactions, which we confirmed using publicly available spatial transcriptomic data. We also found that epithelial-specific proteins in the circulation of responders post-ICB correlate with patient toxicity and likely originate from healthy tissues. Together, these data represent one of the deepest peripheral biomarker studies using paired blood and tumor samples in melanoma patients treated with ICB, and begin to elucidate the complex interplay between tumors and the systemic immune response within the host.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

The molecular basis for these effects can be explored using transcriptional profiling to quantify brain gene expression. In the present report, we used a meta-analysis of public transcriptional profiling data to discover effects of SD on gene expression that are consistent across studies and paradigms. To conduct the meta-analysis, we used pre-specified search terms related to rodent SD paradigms to identify relevant studies within Gemma, a database containing >19,000 re-analyzed microarray and RNA-Seq datasets. Eight studies met our systematic inclusion/exclusion criteria, characterizing the effect of 18 SD interventions on gene expression in the mouse cerebral cortex (collective n=293). For each gene with sufficient data (n=16,290), we fit a random effects meta-analysis model to the SD effect sizes (log(2) fold changes). Our meta-analysis revealed 182 differentially expressed genes in response to SD (false discovery rate<0.05), 104 of which were upregulated and 78 downregulated. Gene-set enrichment analysis (fGSEA) revealed down-regulation in pathways related to stress response (e.g., glucocorticoid receptor, Nr3c1), cell death and neural cell differentiation, and upregulation related to hypoxia and inflammation. Exploratory analyses found that SD duration (ranging from 3-12 hrs) did not significantly influence differential expression. However, recovery sleep (RS: 2-18 hrs) was included in three studies, and reversed the impact of SD on four transcripts. Our meta-analysis illustrates the diverse molecular impact of SD on the rodent cerebral cortex, producing effects that occasionally parallel those seen in the periphery.","NA","biorxiv",1745532509008

We conducted a multi-country evaluation of two novel swab-based molecular tests: Molbio Truenat MTB Ultima (MTB Ultima) and Pluslife MiniDock MTB Test (MiniDock MTB).

MethodsConsecutive people [&ge;]12 years old with presumptive TB were enrolled at outpatient health centers in India, Uganda, and Vietnam. We collected two tongue swabs and prepared two sputum swabs for MTB Ultima and MiniDock MTB testing, then evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MTB Ultima and MiniDock MTB using both swab types against a sputum liquid culture-based microbiological reference standard (MRS). The diagnostic accuracy of swab-based molecular tests was also compared to sputum Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) and auramine smear microscopy.

FindingsFrom January to September 2024, 1,050 participants were included in the tongue swab MTB Ultima evaluation, 197 in the sputum swab MTB Ultima evaluation, and 322 in the MiniDock MTB evaluations. In comparison to sputum Xpert Ultra, sensitivity was similar for both sputum swab MTB Ultima (93.6% vs. 100.0%, difference -6.4%, [95% CI: -15.5, 2.7], p=0.25) and MiniDock MTB (91.0% vs. 94.0%, difference -3.0% [95% CI: -8.6, 2.6], p=0.50). In comparison to sputum smear microscopy, sensitivity was higher for both tongue swab MTB Ultima (77.9% vs. 59.1%, difference 18.8% [95% CI: 10.8, 26.8], p<0.0001) and MiniDock MTB (85.7% vs. 67.1%, difference 18.6% [95% CI: 7.2, 29.9], p=0.001). Specificity was high (>98%) for both tests with sputum swabs and tongue swabs.

InterpretationMTB Ultima and MiniDock MTB have similar accuracy to current sputum-based molecular tests with sputum swabs and meet minimum accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum, near point-of-care molecular test with tongue swabs.

Notably, in the past two decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, affecting individuals under the age of 50 years, has doubled in many countries. The reasons for this increase are unknown. Here, we investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related differences by examining 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries. No major differences were found in microsatellite unstable cancers, but variations in mutation burden and signatures were observed in the 802 microsatellite-stable cases. Multiple signatures, most with unknown etiologies, exhibited varying prevalence in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and Thailand, indicating geographically diverse levels of mutagenic exposure. Signatures SBS88 and ID18, caused by the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin, had higher mutation loads in countries with higher colorectal cancer incidence rates. SBS88 and ID18 were also enriched in early-onset colorectal cancers, being 3.3 times more common in individuals diagnosed before age 40 than in those over 70, and were imprinted early during colorectal cancer development. Colibactin exposure was further linked to APC driver mutations, with ID18 responsible for about 25% of APC driver indels in colibactin-positive cases. This study reveals geographic and age-related variations in colorectal cancer mutational processes, and suggests that early-life mutagenic exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria may contribute to the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

Characterising key epidemiological parameters for H5N1 is critical should it become widespread.

AimTo identify and estimate critical epidemiological parameters for H5N1 from past and current outbreaks, and to compare their characteristics with human influenza subtypes and the 2003 Netherlands H7N7 outbreak.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews reporting parameter estimates from primary data or meta-analyses. To address gaps, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar for studies of any design providing relevant estimates. We estimated the basic reproduction number for the outbreak in the US and the 2003 Netherlands H7N7 outbreak. In addition we estimated the serial interval for H5N1 using data from previous household clusters in Indonesia. We also applied a branching process model to simulate transmission chain size and duration to assess if simulated transmission patterns align with observed dynamics.

ResultsFrom 46 articles, we identified H5N1s epidemiological profile as having lower transmissibility (R0 < 0.2) but higher severity compared to human subtypes. Evidence suggests H5N1 has a longer incubation ([~]4 days vs [~]2 days) and serial intervals ([~]6 days vs [~]3 days) than human subtypes, impacting transmission dynamics. The epidemiology of the US H5 outbreak is similar to the 2003 Netherlands H7N7 outbreak. Key gaps remain regarding latent and infectious periods.

ConclusionsWe characterised critical epidemiological parameters for H5N1 infection. The current U.S. outbreak shows lower pathogenicity, but similar transmissibility compared to prior outbreaks. Longer incubation and serial intervals may enhance contact tracing feasibility. These estimates offer a baseline for monitoring changes in H5N1 epidemiology.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

To better characterize the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of poor sleep in autism, we recruited 5,686 families from SPARK, a nationwide genetic study of autism, who described their sleep experiences using the Childrens Sleep Health Questionnaire (CSHQ) and other self-report items. The collective experiences from this large sample allowed us to discover eight distinct archetypes of sleep in autism. Membership in some of these archetypes showed significant SNP-heritability (0.50 - 0.65, 95% confidence interval = 0.08 - 1), and polygenic estimates of educational attainment, BMI, and ADHD risk contributed extensively to the genetic signatures of these sleep archetypes. Surprisingly, polygenic estimates of general population sleep phenotypes showed sparser and more modest associations, perhaps suggesting that the genetic drivers of disordered sleep in autism may be distinct from those encountered in the general population. GWAS on archetype membership yielded no genome-wide significant loci, however, the most significant gene for the most severe archetype was the nitric oxide (NO) signaling gene NOS1AP, which was previously linked to sleep disruption in schizophrenia. Finally, the eight sleep archetypes showed specific signatures of treatment response across five major categories of sleep aid, pointing to the potential of treatment plans that are tailored to the nature of the sleep problem. These findings provide critical new insight into the comorbidities, subtypes, and genetic risk factors associated with disordered sleep in autism.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses.

Evolution of immunity through five patient cohorts (n = 148 in total) was studied including pre-pandemic, first infection, first vaccine, second vaccine and triple-vaccinated cohorts. A population of immunity endotypes has been observed and is classified against a recovery antibody threshold. U(+) showing protection to all variants; single, double, triple, and further dropout endotypes U({+/-}); some with no variant protection other than Wuhan vaccine spike U(-); and some unclassified, U([~]). These endotypes may be imprinted. In the triple-vaccinated cohort (n = 41) there is a U(+) incidence of 54% (95% CI 39% - 68%) suggesting between half and three-quarters of the population have universal variant vaccine antibody protection; and U({+/-})) with at least one dropout has an incidence of 42% (95% CI 28% - 57%). Extending the cohort incidence to the population, up to 68% of the population may have an imprinted immunity endotype to an epitope that is effective against all variants; critical for both protection and binding to the ACE2 receptor: a universal immunity endotype: up to 13% may not have a sterilising serum leading persistent virus and a risk of long covid.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women. Future studies are required to ascertain the association between semaglutide and hair loss.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008

The mechanisms for these headache types are unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess levels of amyloid related biomarkers in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

MethodsIn this prospective observational cohort, patients with severe headache as the dominating symptom after COVID-19 (n=29) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=31), had neurological assessments with reassessments after 6 months. Plasma levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), pregnancy zone protein (PZP), cathepsin L1 (CTSL) and serum Amyloid A (SAA1) were measured by ELISA in relation to levels in healthy controls (n=16).

ResultsWe found a strong and persistent upregulation of APP in patients with headache after COVID-19 as compared to the two other groups. At both inclusion and after 6 months APP levels were also increased in those with accompanying cognitive symptoms. In contrast, plasma levels of PZP were elevated in patients with headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at both inclusion and after 6 months as compared to healthy controls. CTSL was only elevated in those with COVID-19 associated as compared with those with vaccine associated headache at baseline, whereas SAA1 showed levels comparable in all groups.

ConclusionAltered plasma levels of soluble markers potentially reflecting changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 where we also found some association with cognitive symptoms.

NCT05235776

What is already known on this topicNew onset persistent headache occurs in a subset of individuals after COVID-19 and to some extent after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms are unknown.

What this study addsAltered plasma levels of soluble markers that potentially could reflect changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 with association to cognitive symptoms.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur data underscore the need for more long-time follow-up of patients with new onset headache following COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and this follow-up might also include blood tests for amyloid processing and neuroinflammation.","NA","medrxiv",1745532509008
