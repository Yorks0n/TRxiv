Methods: We employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird). Results: We detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain. Conclusions: While our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688183

There is limited understanding of factors that influence their biodistribution and immunogenicity. Antibodies to polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, are detectable in humans and boosted by human mRNA vaccination. We hypothesized that PEG-specific antibodies could increase the clearance of mRNA vaccines. We developed methods to quantify both the mRNA and ionizable lipid in frequent serial blood samples from 19 subjects receiving Moderna SPIKEVAX mRNA booster immunization. Both the mRNA and ionizable lipid peaked in blood 1-2 days post vaccination (median peak level 0.19 and 3.22 ng mL-1, respectively). The mRNA was detectable out to 14-28 days post-vaccination in most subjects. We measured the proportion of mRNA that was relatively intact in blood over time and found the decay kinetics of the intact mRNA and ionizable lipid were identical, suggesting the intact lipid nanoparticle recirculates in blood. However, mRNA and ionizable lipid decay rates did not correlate with baseline levels of PEG-specific nor spike-specific antibodies. The magnitude of mRNA and ionizable lipid detected in blood did correlate with the boost in PEG antibodies. Further, the ability of subjects monocytes to phagocytose lipid nanoparticles had an inverse relationship with the rise in PEG antibodies. This suggests circulation of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines into the blood and their ability to be cleared by phagocytes influence PEG immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines. Overall, this work defines the pharmacokinetics of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccine components in human blood after intramuscular injection and the factors that influence this. These insights should prove useful in improving the future safety and efficacy of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688183

Prior work established that heteroplasmic mtDNA variants can be used to delineate clonality in hematopoiesis, but they have limited ability to reconstruct cellular phylogenies. However, a recent report by Weng et al. challenges the current paradigm by describing an unprecedented number of shared mtDNA variants between cells that reportedly resolve high-resolution phylogenetic trees. We re-examined the claims of Weng et al., and identified two major points of concern regarding this unprecedented connectedness. First, shared variants between cells are disproportionately detected in a single molecule per cell, and second, these variants are enriched 10-20-fold at the edges of mtDNA molecules, reminiscent of artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. Further, our analyses show that pruning low support and likely artificial mtDNA variants removes nearly all of the reported phylogenetic structure. Thus, we strongly caution against using mtDNA variant calling workflows that rely on minimal evidence, including the computational pipeline introduced in Weng et al., as variants with high connectedness and low evidence are likely artifacts that lead to the construction of false phylogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

In response to infection, TIRs can produce a cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (ADPR) signaling molecule, which activates an effector that depletes the host of the essential metabolite NAD+ to limit phage propagation. How bacterial TIRs recognize phage infection is not known. Here we describe the sensing mechanism for the staphylococcal Thoeris defense system, which consists of two TIR domain sensors, ThsB1 and ThsB2, and the effector ThsA. We show that the major capsid protein of phage {Phi}80 forms a complex with ThsB1 and ThsB2, which is sufficient for the synthesis of 1-3 glycocyclic ADPR (gcADPR) and subsequent activation of NAD+ cleavage by ThsA. Consistent with this, phages that escape Thoeris immunity harbor mutations in the capsid that prevent complex formation. We show that capsid proteins from staphylococcal Siphoviridae belonging to the capsid serogroup B, but not A, are recognized by ThsB1/B2, a result that suggests that capsid recognition by Sau-Thoeris and other anti-phage defense systems may be an important evolutionary force behind the structural diversity of prokaryotic viruses. More broadly, since mammalian toll-like receptors harboring TIR domains can also recognize viral structural components to produce an inflammatory response against infection, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism for the activation of innate antiviral defense pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

We examined the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across various bacterial pathogens and antibiotics.

We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24th, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium (as defined by the study authors) was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool.

42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 =77%). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions.

The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm. Trials powered to detect differences in resistance development or well-designed observational studies are required to clarify the impact of combination therapy on resistance.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688183

However, the relationships among planthopper lineages and families remain unclear. Previous efforts based on inconsistent morphological traits, a few genes, or limited sampling often resulted in conflicting tree topologies. Here, we used genome-level data to assemble 1164 nuclear single-copy genes and 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes for 149 planthopper species representing 19 out of 21 extant families. Additional markers were added from published mitogenomes, expanding our sampling to 285 species. These markers were used for Maximum Likelihood-based tree inference and dating analyses. The newly inferred phylogenies validated well-accepted relationships and recovered novel placements. Taxonomic conclusions include the establishment of a new family Borysthenidae stat. rev. within Delphacoidea and a new superfamily Meenoploidea superfam. nov. including redefined Kinnaridae stat. rev. and Meenoplidae stat. rev., the confirmation of the monophyletic family Achilixiidae outside the Achilidae-Derbidae clade, and the transfer of tribes Lyncidini and Amyclini to Dictyopharidae and the genus Madagascaritia to Fulgoridae. The time analyses based on 57 nuclear markers and 30 fossils dated the origin of crown Fulgoromorpha back to Guadalupian, Permian ([~]263 Ma), close to the maximum constraint at 267.3 Ma, while applying an older root constraint resulted in an origin in Mississippian, Carboniferous ([~]332 Ma). While future sampling of unstudied fauna in unexplored regions or habitats may change the topology, the current phylogenomic analysis will serve as a solid foundation for research into planthopper ecology, evolution, and significance.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the reemergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024. Methods: In this study, we combined OROV genomic, molecular, and serological data from Brazil from 1 January 2015 to 29 June 2024, along with in vitro and in vivo characterization. Molecular screening data included 234 patients with febrile illness or central nervous system (CNS) manifestations between December 2023 and May 2024 from the Amazonas State. Genomic data comprised two genomic OROV sequences from patients. Serological data were obtained from neutralizing antibody tests comparing the prototype OROV strain BeAn 19991 and the 2024 epidemic strain. Epidemiological data included aggregated cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 1 January 2014 to 29 June 2024. Findings: In 2024, autochthonous OROV infections were detected in previously non-endemic areas across all five Brazilian regions. Cases were reported in 19 of 27 federal units, with 83.2% (6,895 of 8,284) of infections in Northern Brazil and a nearly 200-fold increase in incidence compared to reported cases over the last decade. We detected OROV RNA in 10.8% (10 of 93) of patients with febrile illness and 2.1% (3 of 141) of patients with CNS manifestations between December 2023 and May 2024 in Amazonas. We demonstrate that the 2023-2024 epidemic was caused by a novel OROV reassortant that replicated approximately 100-fold higher titers in mammalian cells compared to the prototype strain. The 2023-2024 OROV reassortant displayed plaques earlier than the prototype, produced 1.7 times more plaques, and plaque sizes were 2.5 larger compared to the prototype. Furthermore, serum collected in 2016 from previously OROV-infected individuals showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralizing capacity against the reassortment strain compared to the prototype. Interpretation: These findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to a better understanding of the 2023-2024 OROV reemergence. The recent increased incidence may be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new reassortant virus that also evades previous immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688183

Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon via admixture, while the others established early in the deep benthics. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage and a striking excess of protein changing substitutions pointing towards selection on sensory, behavioural and reproductive genes. We conclude that repeated interplay between depth adaptation and sex-specific selection on large inversions has been central to the evolution of this iconic system.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

We find that recurrent processing substantially shapes visual representations across the ventral visual stream, starting early on at around 100ms in early visual cortex (EVC) and in two later phases of around 175 and 300ms in lateral occipital cortex (LOC), adding persistent rather than transient neural dynamics to visual processing. Using deep neural network models for comparison with the brain, we show that recurrence changes the feature format in LOC from predominantly mid-level to more high-level features. Finally, we show that recurrence is mediated by four distinct spectro-temporal neural components in EVC and LOC, which span the theta to beta frequency range. Together, our results reveal the nature and mechanisms of the effects of recurrent processing on the visual representations in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

Eisfeld et al. examined the pathogenicity and transmissibility of a bovine HPAI H5N1 virus isolated from New Mexico in a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. They found the virus has a dual human- and avian virus-like receptor-binding specificity as measured in a solid phase glycan binding assay. Here, we examined the receptor specificity of a bovine HPAI H5N1 virus (A/bovine/OH/B24OSU-432/2024, H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b) employing four different assays including glycan array technology, bio-layer interferometry (BLI), a solid phase capture assay and hemagglutination of glycan remodeled erythrocytes.

As the virus has now been circulating entirely among dogs for 20 years, we here update our understanding of the evolution of virus in its new host. As a host-switched virus, H3N2 CIV will also reveal any host-adaptive changes arising during thousands of infections within its new host, and our analysis showed that the virus has evolved at a constant rate. CIV was first introduced into North America in 2015 from Korea, and we specifically examined the epidemiology of the virus among dogs in North America since then, including local outbreaks, regional die-outs, and repeated reintroduction from Asia. The H3N2 CIV now appears endemic only in China after dying out in South Korea around 2017. Virus lineages circulating in China appear to have seeded the most recent US outbreaks - with 2 or 3 introductions into North America during the past 3 years. Combining clinical reports, diagnostic testing data, and analysis of viral genomes we show that the virus spreads rapidly among dogs in kennels and shelters in different regions - likely dying out locally after all those animals become infected and immune. The overall epidemic therefore requires longer-distance dispersal of virus to initiate outbreaks in new locations. Patterns of spread in the USA may select viruses most adapted to those dense populations, which may lack the properties required for efficient long-distance transfers to other dog populations that would keep the virus in prolonged circulation.

IMPORTANCEViruses occasionally jump into new hosts to cause epidemics and may spread widely due to movement of humans or animals, or their viruses, with profound consequences for global health. The emergence and epidemiology of new epidemic viruses in companion animals provides a model for understanding disease dynamics and evolution. The H3N2 canine influenza virus arose from an avian virus, and infected dogs provide many opportunities for human exposure. H3N2 CIV transmission is dominated by fast-moving outbreaks within dense populations in animal shelters or kennels, while sustaining the epidemic likely requires movement of virus to more distant dog populations. Viral spread within North Americahas only been sustained for a few years at a time after which the virus dies out. The epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of this virus in this structured host population shows how an acute respiratory pathogen can emerge and spread in a new host and population.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

Recent studies suggest there is a primate-specific population of striatal inhibitory interneurons, the TAC3 interneurons5. However, there has not yet been a detailed analysis of the spatial and phylogenetic distribution of this population. Here, we profile single cell gene expression in the developing pig (an ungulate) and ferret (a carnivore), representing 94 million years divergence from primates, and assign newborn inhibitory neurons to initial classes first specified during development. We find that the initial class of TAC3 interneurons represents an ancestral striatal population that is also deployed towards the cortex in pig and ferret. In adult mouse, we uncover a rare population expressing Tac2, the ortholog of TAC3, in ventromedial striatum, prompting a reexamination of developing mouse striatal interneuron initial classes by targeted enrichment of their precursors. We conclude that the TAC3 interneuron initial class is conserved across Boreoeutherian mammals, with the mouse population representing Th striatal interneurons, a subset of which expresses Tac2. This study suggests that initial classes of telencephalic inhibitory neurons are largely conserved and that during evolution, neuronal types in the mammalian brain change through redistribution and fate refinement, rather than by derivation of novel precursors early in development.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

Here, we investigate the nature of representations underlying object recognition in older compared to younger adults by tracking them in time using EEG, across space using fMRI, and by probing their behavioral relevance using similarity judgements. Applying a multivariate analysis framework to combine experimental assessments, four key findings about how brain aging impacts object recognition emerge. First, aging selectively delays the formation of object representations, profoundly changing the chronometry of visual processing. Second, the delay in the formation of object representations emerges in high-level rather than low- and mid-level ventral visual cortex, supporting the theory that brain areas developing last deteriorate first. Third, aging reduces content selectivity in high-level ventral visual cortex, indicating age-related neural dedifferentiation as the mechanism of representational change. Finally, we demonstrate that the identified representations of the aging brain are behaviorally relevant, ascertaining ecological relevance. Together, our results reveal the impact of healthy aging on the visual brain.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) has emerged as a powerful tool to elucidate the evolutionary history of protein families and identify sequence determinants of protein function. Here, we present AncFlow, an automated software pipeline that integrates phylogenetic analysis, subfamily identification, and ASR to generate ancestral protein sequences for structural prediction using state-of-the-art tools like AlphaFold. AncFlow streamlines the process of ASR by combining multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree inference, subfamily identification, and ancestral sequence reconstruction from unaligned protein sequences. The reconstructed ancestral sequences are then subjected to structural prediction using AlphaFold, enabling the investigation of the structural basis of functional divergence within protein families. We validated AncFlow using two well-characterized protein families: acyltransferases and dehydrogenases. The pipeline successfully reconstructed ancestral sequences for multiple internal nodes of the phylogenetic trees, and their predicted structures were compared with those of extant proteins. By analyzing the structural similarities and differences between ancestral and extant proteins, we gained insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the functional diversification within these families. AncFlow demonstrates the potential of integrating ASR and structural prediction to unravel the structural basis of functional divergence in protein families. The insights gained from this approach can guide protein engineering efforts, facilitating the design of proteins with desired functions. As the amount of sequence data continues to grow, AncFlow provides a valuable tool for exploring the evolutionary landscape of proteins and accelerating the discovery of novel protein functions.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

Despite this progress, more biomarkers, ideally in blood, are needed for effective patient management and disease monitoring for Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

METHODSWe employed the Nucleic Acid-Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) central nervous system (CNS) panel for biomarker quantification in plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, Lewy body dementia, progranulin (GRN) mutation carriers and matched controls.

RESULTSNULISA identified p-tau217 and NfL as the most significantly deregulated plasma biomarkers in the AD continuum and GRN mutation carriers, respectively. Importantly, numerous novel and significant proteomic changes were observed in each disease comparison, which included proteins involved in synaptic processing, inflammation, microglial reactivity, TDP-43 and -synuclein pathology. Plasma and serum act as complimentary biofluids.

CONCLUSIONWe highlight the potential of next-generation biomarker identification tools, such as NULISA, to detect novel proteomic features that incorporate established biomarkers like p-tau217 and NfL.

During these times, the state of the brain should change rapidly, or reset, to ensure that the information encountered before and after an event boundary is encoded in different neuronal populations. Norepinephrine (NE) is thought to facilitate this network reorganization. However, it is unknown whether event boundaries drive NE release in the hippocampus and, if so, how NE release relates to changes in hippocampal firing patterns. The advent of the new GRABNE sensor now allows for the measurement of NE binding with sub-second resolution. Using this tool in mice, we tested whether NE is released into the dorsal hippocampus during event boundaries defined by unexpected transitions between spatial contexts and presentations of novel objections. We found that NE binding dynamics were well explained by the time elapsed after each of these environmental changes, and were not related to conditioned behaviors, exploratory bouts of movement, or reward. Familiarity with a spatial context accelerated the rate in which phasic NE binding decayed to baseline. Knowing when NE is elevated, we tested how hippocampal coding of space differs during these moments. Immediately after context transitions we observed relatively unique patterns of neural spiking which settled into a modal state at a similar rate in which NE returned to baseline. These results are consistent with a model wherein NE release drives hippocampal representations away from a steady-state attractor. We hypothesize that the distinctive neural codes observed after each event boundary may facilitate long-term memory and contribute to the neural basis for the primacy effect.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

Here we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) tumor samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology.

A prominent example of a self-assembly process forming a structure whose size scales with cell size is Cdc42-driven cell polarization and subsequent septin ring formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms that determine Cdc42 cluster and septin ring size are still unclear. Combining computational modeling, live-cell imaging and genetic manipulations, we show here that positive feedback in the polarization pathway, together with the amount of polarity proteins increasing with cell size, can account for the increase of the Cdc42 cluster area with cell size, and as a consequence also the scaling of the septin ring diameter. We demonstrate that in bni1{Delta} cells, which have a larger septin ring compared to wild-type cells but a similarly sized Cdc42-GTP cluster, disruption of F-actin cable assembly and polarization toward the bud site results in diffuse exocytosis, causing septin ring enlargement. Furthermore, we find that in cells with impaired negative feedback in the polarization pathway, the Cdc42-GTP cluster area expands compared to wild-type cells, while the septin ring diameter remains mostly unchanged. This decoupling can be partially explained by a high recruitment rate of septin via polarity factors. Taken together, we provide insights into the origin of septin ring size control, in particular the scaling with cell volume, by integrating new experimental findings and mechanistic models of budding yeast polarization.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

Recent technological advances in DNA sequencing-based assays have revealed locus- and chromatin state-specific structural patterns at the length scale of a few nucleosomes (~1 kb). However, interpreting these data sets remains challenging. Radiation-induced correlated cleavage of chromatin (RICC-seq) is one such chromatin structure assay that maps DNA-DNA-contacts at base pair resolution by sequencing single-stranded DNA fragments released from irradiated cells. Here, we develop a flexible modeling and simulation framework to enable the interpretation of RICC-seq data in terms of oligonucleosome structure ensembles. Nucleosomes are modeled as rigid bodies with excluded volume and adjustable DNA wrapping, connected by linker DNA modeled as a worm-like chain. We validate the model's parameters against cryo-electron microscopy and sedimentation data. Our results show that RICC-seq is sensitive to nucleosome spacing, nucleosomal DNA wrapping, and the strength of inter-nucleosome interactions. We show that nucleosome repeat lengths consistent with orthogonal assays can be extracted from experimental RICC-seq data using a 1D convolutional neural net trained on RICC-seq signal predicted from simulated ensembles.

Emerging evidence suggests that ether lipids play a significant role in physiology and human health. However, their cellular functions remain largely unknown due to a lack of tools for identifying their subcellular localization and interacting proteins. Here, we address this methodological gap by synthesizing minimally modified bifunctional ether lipid probes by introducing diazirine and alkyne groups. To interrogate the subcellular kinetics of intracellular ether lipid transport in mammalian cells we used a combination of fluorescence imaging, machine learning-assisted image analysis and mathematical modelling. We find that alkyl-linked ether lipids are transported up to twofold faster than vinyl-linked species (plasmalogens), pointing to yet undiscovered cellular lipid transport machinery able to distinguish between linkage types differing by as little as two hydrogen atoms. We find that ether lipid transport predominantly occurs via non-vesicular pathways, with varying contributions from vesicular mechanisms between cell types, hinting at cell type-specific adaptations of the relatively conserved major transport mechanism. Altogether, our results suggest that differential recognition of alkyl- and vinyl ether lipids by lipid transfer proteins contributes to their distinct biological functions. In the future, the probes reported here will enable studying ether lipid biology in much greater detail through identification of interacting proteins and in-depth characterization of intracellular ether lipid dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

We anticipate MultiMIL will become an essential tool for querying single-cell multiomic atlases, enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and informing targeted treatments.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688183

Advances in population-scale sequencing now provide an unprecedented opportunity to uncover additional large-effect rare genetic risk factors and expand our understanding of disease mechanisms.

MethodsWe leveraged whole-genome sequence data with linked electronic health records from 490,560 UK Biobank participants, identifying 3,809 PD cases and 247,101 controls without a neurological disorder. We performed both variant- and gene-level association analyses to identify novel genetic associations with PD. We analyzed two additional independent case-control cohorts for replication (totaling 3,739 cases and 58,156 controls). Additionally, we performed functional validation of a novel PD association in a human synuclein-expressing Drosophila model.

FindingsIn the UK Biobank, we replicated associations in well-established loci including GBA1 and LRRK2. We also identified a novel association between protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in ITSN1 and an increased risk of PD, with an effect size exceeding those of established loci (Fishers Exact Test: p=6.1x10-7; Odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 10.53 [5.20, 21.34]). We replicated the ITSN1 risk signal in a meta-analysis across all cohorts (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test p=5.7x10-9; Odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 9.20 [4.66, 16.70]). In Drosophila, haploinsufficiency of the ITSN1 ortholog (Dap160) exacerbated -synuclein- induced compound eye degeneration and motor deficits.

InterpretationWe establish ITSN1 as a novel risk gene for PD, with PTVs substantially increasing disease risk. ITSN1 encodes a scaffold protein involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, a critical pathway increasingly recognized in PD pathogenesis. Our findings highlight the power of large-scale sequencing coupled with preclinical functional modeling to identify rare variant associations and elucidate disease mechanisms.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688183

We demonstrated different coverage landscapes of k-mers enriched in deer and bats and unraveled 148 mutations in enriched k-mers yielded from the comparison of viral metagenomes between bat and human isolates.

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688183

A spatiotemporal tri-omic atlas of the mouse brain was obtained at different stages from postnatal day P0 to P21, and compared to the regions of interest in the human developing brains. Specifically, in the cortical area, we discovered temporal persistence and spatial spreading of chromatin accessibility for the layer-defining transcription factors. In corpus callosum, we observed dynamic chromatin priming of myelin genes across the subregions. Together, it suggests a role for layer specific projection neurons to coordinate axonogenesis and myelination. We further mapped the brain of a lysolecithin (LPC) neuroinflammation mouse model and observed common molecular programs in development and neuroinflammation. Microglia, exhibiting both conserved and distinct programs for inflammation and resolution, are transiently activated not only at the core of the LPC lesion, but also at distal locations presumably through neuronal circuitry.

We find that white matter connections are organized by cytoarchitecture, eccentricity, and category from birth. Connectivity profiles of functional regions in the same cytoarchitectonic area are similar from birth and develop in parallel, with decreases in endpoint connectivity to lateral occipital, and parietal, and somatosensory cortex, and increases to lateral prefrontal cortex.

We thus lack a mechanistic framework that links functional adaptability with environmental pressures. Here, we leverage the diversity of natural tubulin variants from three closely related frog species that live at different temperatures: we combine in vitro reconstitution assays, quantitative biochemistry, and cryogenic electron microscopy to show how a small number of primary sequence changes influences the energy landscape of tubulin interactions and thereby mediates cold-adaptation and microtubule stability.

In this study, we employed a multi-omics approach, including RNA sequencing (GEO identifier GSE273052) and proteomics (ProteomeXchange identifier PXD054147), to investigate the alterations in BAT and its EVs in the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS. Our results revealed significant changes in the proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of BAT from SOD1-G93A mice, highlighting ALS-related features such as mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired differentiation capacity. Specifically, primary brown adipocytes (PBAs) from SOD1-G93A mice exhibited differentiation impairment, respiratory defects, and alterations in mitochondrial dynamics. Furthermore, the BAT-derived EVs from SOD1-G93A mice displayed distinct changes in size distribution and cargo content, which negatively impacted the differentiation and homeostasis of C2C12 murine myoblasts, as well as induced atrophy in C2C12-derived myotubes.

Utilizing transcriptomic profiling, assessments of chromatin accessibility, mitochondrial phenotyping, and lipidomics analyses, we observed that SC-{beta} cells exhibit reduced oxidative and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism compared to primary human islets that are related to limitations in key mitochondrial transcriptional networks. Surprisingly, we found that reductions in glucose-stimulated mitochondrial respiration in SC-islets were not associated with alterations in mitochondrial mass, structure, or genome integrity. In contrast, SC-islets show limited expression of targets of PPAR and PPAR{gamma}, which regulate mitochondrial programming, yet whose functions in {beta} cell differentiation are unknown. Importantly, treatment with WY14643, a potent PPAR agonist, induced expression of mitochondrial targets, improved insulin secretion, and increased the formation and maturation of SC-{beta} cells both in vitro and following transplantation.

Many cellular responses during epileptogenesis are also common hallmarks of cellular senescence, which halts proliferation of damaged cells. Clearing senescent cells (SCs) restores function in several age-associated and neurodegenerative disease models. It is unknown whether SC accumulation contributes to epileptogenesis and associated cognitive impairments. To address this question, we used a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and characterized the senescence phenotype throughout epileptogenesis. SCs accumulated 2 weeks after SE and were predominantly microglia. We ablated SCs and reduced (and in some cases prevented) the emergence of spontaneous seizures and normalized cognitive function in mice. Suggesting that this is a translationally-relevant target we also found SC accumulation in resected hippocampi from patients with TLE. These findings indicate that SC ablation after an epileptogenic insult is a potential anti-epileptogenic therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

When compared to meiotic maturation, relatively little is known about the key processes that happen in growing oocytes. Since the first visualization of oocyte chromatin under the electron microscope, we have known that growing oocytes undergo a fundamental transition from the non-surrounded nucleolus (NSN) to surrounded nucleolus (SN) chromatin configuration. NSN-to-SN transition is crucial for subsequent embryonic development after fertilization, but what drives NSN-to-SN transition during mammalian oocyte development is still unknown. Here we show that natural degradation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) by segregase and proteasome drives NSN-to-SN transition, challenging the conventional view that transcriptional silencing and NSN-to-SN transition are driven by independent epigenetic mechanisms in mammalian oocytes.

The final step of oocyte growth, which reorganizes chromatin from the uncondensed, non-surrounded nucleolus (NSN) configuration to the condensed, surrounded nucleolus (SN) configuration, is essential for embryonic development after fertilization. However, the mechanism of NSN-to-SN transition remains unknown. Here, we identify RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) degradation as the key driver of this process. RNAPII inhibitors, but not nucleoside-based transcription inhibitors, swiftly induced RNAPII degradation and NSN-to-SN transition in oocytes. Strikingly, induced SN-like nuclei recapitulated epigenetic features, chromatin interactions and developmental potential in SN oocytes. Using segregase and proteasome inhibitors and the newly established scFv miniTrim-Away for nuclear proteins, we further demonstrate that RNAPII degradation is necessary and sufficient for NSN-to-SN transition in mouse and human. RNAPII degradation globally cleared RNAPII from transcriptionally active chromatin and increased chromatin dynamics, concomitantly leading to transcriptional silencing and chromatin rearrangement in oocytes. Our study elucidates the framework of chromatin reorganization in growing mammalian oocytes and provides an alternative source of fully grown oocyte nuclei, representing a milestone for the potential use of growing oocytes in reproductive medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

While there have been numerous reports related to PD in East Asia, there has been a lack of contribution from single-cell (or nucleus) transcriptome studies, which have been making significant contributions to understanding PD. In this study, a total of 33,293 nuclei obtained from the substantia nigra (SN) of confirmed pathological PD and control patients in South Korea were profiled, revealing 8 different cell types through cluster analysis. Monocle-based pseudotime analysis identified two disease-associated trajectories for each astrocyte and microglia and identified genes that differentiate them. Interestingly, we uncovered the inflammatory intervention in the early PD-associated transition in microglia and identified the molecular features of this intermediate state of microglia. In addition, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on TENET analysis revealed the detrimental effect of an HSPA5-led module in microglia and MSRB3- and HDAC8- led modules specifying the two different astrocyte trajectories. In SN neurons, we observed population changes, a decrease in dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons and a proportional increase in GABAergic neurons. By deconvolution in spatial transcriptome obtained the PD sample, we confirmed spatiotemporal heterogeneity of neuronal subpopulations and PD-associated progressive gliosis specific to dopaminergic nuclei, SN and ventral tegmental areas (VTAs). In conclusion, our approach has enabled us to identify the genetic and spatial characterization of neurons and to demonstrate different glial fates in PD. These findings advance our molecular understanding of cell type-specific changes in the progression of Korean PD, providing an important foundation for predicting and validating interventions or drug effects for future treatments.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

In contrast, in subcortical lesions motor skill acquisition was associated with smaller motor evoked potentials (?=-4.46, 95% CI [-8.54,-0.38]; p=0.033), less intracortical inhibition (?=3.45, 95% CI [0.34,6.56]; p=0.030) and higher facilitation (?=1.34,95% CI [0.15,2.54]; p= 0.028) ipsilesionally. Sensitivity analyses revealed that associations with intracortical inhibition and facilitation in the subcortical group were driven by lesions affecting the corticospinal tract. No associations were found in the contralesional hemisphere. Conclusions: Reinforcing the existence of lesion-specific neurophysiological patterns, individuals with cortical and subcortical lesions show divergent associations between cortico-spinal excitability and motor skill acquisition. The use of cortico-spinal excitability as a biomarker to predict upper-limb recovery post-stroke or guide motor recovery interventions such as non-invasive brain stimulation should consider lesion location.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688184

Interruptions, or gaps, of sulci (historically known as pli de passage) are particularly intriguing as previous work suggests that these interruptions have a causal effect on cognitive development. Here, we tested how the presence and morphology of sulcal interruptions in the left posterior occipitotemporal sulcus (pOTS) longitudinally impact the development of a culturally-acquired skill: reading. Forty-three children were successfully followed from age 5 in kindergarten, at the onset of literacy instruction, to ages 7 and 8 with assessments of cognitive, pre-literacy, and literacy skills, as well as MRI anatomical scans at ages 5 and 8. Crucially, we demonstrate that the presence of a left pOTS gap at 5 years is a specific and robust longitudinal predictor of better future reading skills in children, with large observed benefits on reading behavior ranging from letter knowledge to reading comprehension. The effect of left pOTS interruptions on reading acquisition accumulated through time, and was larger than the impact of benchmark cognitive and familial predictors of reading ability and disability. Finally, we show that increased local U-fiber white matter connectivity associated with such sulcal interruptions possibly underlie these behavioral benefits, by providing a computational advantage. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative evidence supporting a potential integrative gray-white matter mechanism underlying the cognitive benefits of macro-anatomical differences in sulcal morphology related to longitudinal improvements in a culturally-acquired skill.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

What the mice eat in these barren, hyperarid environments has been the subject of much speculation. According to the arthropod fallout hypothesis, sustenance is provided by windblown insects that accumulate in snowdrifts ( aolian deposits). It is also possible that mice feed on saxicolous lichen or forms of cryptic vegetation that have yet to be discovered at such high elevations. We tested hypotheses about the diet of mice living at extreme elevations on Atacama volcanoes by combining metagenomic and DNA metabarcoding analyses of gut contents with stable-isotope analyses of mouse tissues. Genomic analyses of contents of the gastrointestinal tract of a live-captured mouse from the 6739 m summit of Volcan Llullaillaco revealed evidence for an opportunistic but purely herbivorous diet, including lichens. Although we found no evidence of animal DNA in gut contents of the summit mouse, stable isotope data indicate that mice native to elevations at or near vegetation limits ([~]5100 m) include a larger fraction of animal prey in their diet than mice from lower elevations. Some plant species detected in the gut contents of the summit mouse are known to exist at lower elevations at the base of the volcano and in the surrounding Altiplano, suggesting that such plants may occur at higher elevations beneath the snowpack or in other cryptic microhabitats.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

The coacervate-based droplets in these synthetic cells sediment and fuse at the cells bottom. Through a newly discovered size control mechanism, the sedimented, large droplets shrink by expelling droplet material. The expelled molecules nucleate new droplets at the top of the synthetic cell, which grow and sediment again. These oscillations are sustained by converting chemical fuel into waste and can continue for hundreds of periods without evidence of fatigue. Strikingly, the period of the oscillation is in the minutes regime and tunable. The design of oscillating organelles in synthetic cells brings us closer to creating more life-like materials and de novo life.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

While the majority of germline-expressed RNAi pathway components reside in perinuclear germ granules, it is unknown whether and how RNAi pathways are spatially organized in other cell types. Here we find that the small RNA biogenesis machinery is spatially and temporally organized during embryogenesis. Specifically, the RNAi factor, SIMR-1, forms visible concentrates during mid-embryogenesis that contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a poly-UG polymerase, and the unloaded nuclear Argonaute protein, NRDE-3. Further, we observe that many other RNAi factors form foci in embryonic cells distinct from SIMR granules, including the Argonaute protein CSR-1, underscoring a potential role for cytoplasmic concentrates of RNAi factors to promote gene regulation in embryos. Curiously, coincident with the appearance of the ""SIMR granules"", the small RNAs bound to NRDE-3 switch from predominantly CSR-class 22G-RNAs to ERGO-dependent 22G-RNAs. Thus, our study defines two separable roles for NRDE-3, targeting germline-expressed genes during early embryogenesis and switching later in embryogenesis to repress recently duplicated genes and retrotransposons in somatic cells, highlighting the plasticity of Argonaute proteins and the need for more precise temporal characterization of Argonaute-small RNA interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

Recent evidence suggests that these waves directionality and spatiotemporal extent encode cognitive processes, yet the encoding mechanism related to their frequency remains unclear.

We explore the hypothesis that coherence frequency dictates the velocity of wave propagation. Using nonlinear coherence analysis to compute propagation pathways among four local-field-potential signals collected along the human hippocampuss long axis, we present evidence that the coherence frequency of traveling waves encodes temporal communication aspects. Unlike linear analyses, which may overestimate velocities due to bidirectional flow when considering multiple pair coherences, nonlinear analysis treats pathways as holistic units with affectively unidirectional flow, making it more suitable for calculating wave velocities. Our findings reveal that propagation velocities along the hippocampus at low frequencies (<[~]35Hz) demonstrate a linear dependency on frequency, with an increased slope at higher frequencies, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Although observed within the hippocampus, these findings capture a dependency between frequency and velocity of traveling waves which may be applicable to other cortical areas as well.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

The low abundance of HLA-I peptides poses significant technical challenges for their identification and accurate quantification. While mass spectrometry (MS) is currently a method of choice for direct system-wide identification of cellular immunopeptidome, there is still a need for enhanced sensitivity in detecting and quantifying tumor specific epitopes. As gas phase separation in data-dependent MS data acquisition (DDA) increased HLA-I peptide detection by up to 50%, here, we aimed to evaluate the performance of data-independent acquisition (DIA) in combination with ion mobility (diaPASEF) for high-sensitivity identification of HLA presented peptides. Our streamlined diaPASEF workflow enabled identification of 11,412 unique peptides from 12.5 million A375 cells and 3,426 8-11mers from as low as 500,000 cells with high reproducibility. By taking advantage of HLA binder-specific in-silico predicted spectral libraries, we were able to further increase the number of identified HLA-I peptides. We applied SILAC-DIA to a mixture of labeled HLA-I peptides, calculated heavy-to-light ratios for 7,742 peptides across 5 conditions and demonstrated that diaPASEF achieves high quantitative accuracy up to 4-fold dilution. Finally, we identified and quantified shared neoantigens in a monoallelic C1R cell line model. By spiking in heavy synthetic peptides, we verified the identification of the peptide sequences and calculated relative abundances for 13 neoantigens. Taken together, diaPASEF analysis workflows for HLA-I peptides can increase the peptidome coverage for lower sample amounts. The sensitivity and quantitative precision provided by DIA can enable the detection and quantification of less abundant peptide species such as neoantigens across samples from the same background.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

The substantial densities of both microbial populations and VLPs challenge traditional explanations of top-down control exerted by viruses.

In this work we examine the episomal maintenance of a virus within a Salinibacter ruber host. We found that infected cultures of Sal. ruber M1 developed a population-level resistance and underwent systematic and reproducible recovery post infection that was counter-intuitively dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI), where higher MOI led to better host outcomes. Furthermore, we developed a nonlinear population dynamics model that successfully reproduced the qualitative features of the recovery. This suggests that the maintenance of the virus episomally, often referred to as pseudolysogeny, and lysis inhibition allow for host-virus co-existence under high MOI infections. Our results emphasize the ecological importance of exploring a spectrum of viral infection strategies beyond the conventional binary of lysis or lysogeny.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

Cellulose is processively synthesized as bundles of linear {beta}-1,4-glucan homopolymer chains via the coordinated action of multiple enzymes in cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) embedded within the plasma cell membrane. Plant cell walls are composed of multiple layers of cellulose fibrils that form highly intertwined extracellular matrix networks. However, it is not yet clear as to how cellulose fibrils synthesized by multiple CSCs are assembled into the intricate cellulose network deposited on plant cell surfaces. Herein, we have established an in vivo time-resolved imaging platform for visualizing cellulose during its biosynthesis and assembly into a complex fibrillar network on the surface of Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll protoplasts as the primary cell wall regenerates. We performed total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) with fluorophore-conjugated tandem carbohydrate binding modules (tdCBMs) that were engineered to specifically bind to nascent cellulose fibrils. Together with a well-controlled environment, it was possible to monitor in vivo cellulose fibril synthesis dynamics in a time-resolved manner for nearly one day of continuous cell wall regeneration on protoplast cell surfaces. Our observations provide the basis for a novel model of cellulose fibril network development in protoplasts driven by complex interplay of multi-scale dynamics that include: rapid diffusion and coalescence of short nascently synthesized cellulose fibrils; processive elongation of single fibrils; and cellulose fibrillar network rearrangement during cell wall maturation.

Using chemical genetics, here we report the identification of a small molecule, kC9, that triggers excessive stomatal differentiation by inhibiting the canonical ERECTA receptor-kinase pathway. kC9 binds to and inhibits the downstream MAP kinase MPK6, perturbing its substrate interaction. Strikingly, activation of immune signaling by a bacterial flagellin peptide nullified kC9's effects on stomatal development. This cross-activation of stomatal development by immune signaling depends on the immune receptor FLS2 and occurs even in the absence of kC9 if the ERECTA-family receptor population becomes suboptimal. Furthermore, proliferating stomatal-lineage cells are vulnerable to the immune signal penetration. Our findings suggest that the signal specificity between development and immunity can be ensured by MAP Kinase homeostasis reflecting the availability of upstream receptors, thereby providing a novel view on signal specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

However, the impact of the mechanical properties of the ECM, specifically collagen fibril alignment and crosslinking, on macrophage behavior and polarization is less understood. To investigate this, we reconstituted 3D collagen matrices to mimic the physical characteristics of the TME. Our results demonstrated that stiffening the matrix through the alignment or crosslinking of collagen fibrils promotes macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. This phenotype is characterized by increased expression of CD105 and CD206 and a distinct cytokine secretion profile. The increased stiffness and aligned fibrils activate mechanotransduction pathways, notably integrin {beta}1 and PI3K signaling, leading to increased IL-4 secretion, which acts in an autocrine manner to further promote M2 polarization. Interestingly, these stiffened microenvironments also suppressed the proinflammatory response. In coculture experiments with breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), macrophages within stiffened or aligned matrices significantly increased cancer cell proliferation and invasion. These findings suggest that the mechanical properties of the ECM, specifically its alignment and crosslinking, create a more favorable environment for tumor progression by modulating macrophage activity. Overall, our study underscores the critical role of ECM mechanics in shaping immune cell behavior within the TME, highlighting the potential for therapies that target ECM properties and macrophage polarization to inhibit cancer progression and enhance treatment efficacy.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

During fast growth, replication and segregation co-occur. Overlapping cycles of DNA replication and segregation require efficient segregation of the origin of replication (Ori), which is known to be orchestrated by the protein families SMC and ParAB. We used data-driven physical modeling to study the roles of these proteins in Ori segregation. Developing a polymer model of the Bacillus subtilis genome based on Hi-C data, we analyzed chromosome structures in wild-type cells and mutants lacking SMC or ParAB. Wild-type chromosomes showed clear Ori segregation, while the mutants lacked faithful segregation. The model suggests that the dual role of ParB proteins, loading SMCs near the Ori and interacting with ParA, is crucial for Ori segregation. ParB-loaded SMCs compact individual Ori and introduce an effective inter-sister repulsion that regulates the ParAB-activity to avoid the detrimental scenario of pulling both Ori to the same pole. The model makes testable predictions for sister-chromosome-resolved Hi-C experiments and proposes that replicated sister chromosomes segregate via mechanistic cooperation of SMC and ParAB activity.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

Previous stable oxygen isotope studies suggested that several taxa belonging to these groups were endothermic and for some of them homeothermic organisms. However, these conclusions remain contentious owing to the associated uncertainties regarding the {delta}18O value and oxygen isotope fractionation relative to environmental sea water. Here, we present new hydroxylapatite phosphate {delta}18O values ({delta}18Op) of Ichthyosauria, Plesiosauria and Metriorhynchidae (Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous) recovered from mid- to high-paleolatitudes to better constrain their thermophysiology and investigate the presence of regional heterothermies. The intra-skeletal {delta}18Op variability failed to reveal distinct heterothermic patterns within any of the specimens, indicating either intra-body temperature homogeneity or an overriding diagenetic overprint of the original biological {delta}18Op bone record. Body temperature estimates have then been reassessed from new and published {delta}18Op values of well-preserved isolated teeth, recently revised Mesozoic latitudinal {delta}18O oceanic gradient and 18O-enrichment factor of fully aquatic air-breathing vertebrates. Our results confirm that Ichthyosauria were homeothermic endotherms (31{degrees}C to 41{degrees}C), while Plesiosauria were likely poikilothermic endotherms (27{degrees}C to 34{degrees}C). The new body temperature estimates of the Metriorhynchidae (25{degrees}C to 32{degrees}C) closely follow ambient temperatures and point to poikilothermic strategy with no or little endothermic abilities. These results improve our understanding of Mesozoic marine reptile thermoregulation and indicate that due to their limited body temperature variations, the {delta}18Op values from Ichthyosauria fossil remains could be used as valuable archives of Mesozoic oceans {delta}18Osw values that may help improve palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstructions.

Non-technical abstractSome marine reptiles from the Mesozoic such as ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and metriorhynchids, were capable of reaching elevated body temperatures and for some of them to maintain it few degrees above that of their marine environment, a characteristic similar to that observed in modern cetaceans. Nevertheless, the estimation of their body temperature from the chemical oxygen signature of their fossil remains (bones and teeth) is accompanied by uncertainties associated with the chemical oxygen signature of the surrounding water and the mineralisation processes of the bones and teeth. In this study, new data were collected from four ichthyosaurs, three plesiosaurs and one metriorhynchid in order to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which these marine reptiles were able to maintain a body temperature higher than that of their environment. The chemical signatures of oxygen in the bones and teeth of the specimens did not exhibit any discernible patterns indicative of specific zones of heat production or loss, as observed in modern marine vertebrates. Concurrently, we reassessed the estimated body temperature of these marine reptiles, thereby corroborating the hypothesis that ichthyosaurs were homeothermic endotherms. Conversely, our novel estimates suggest that plesiosaurs were likely poikilothermic endotherms, whereas metriorhynchids were probably also poikilothermic endotherms but with a limited capacity for heat production. Finally, the narrow range of body temperatures maintained by ichthyosaurs indicates that the oxygen chemical signature of fossilised remains could serve as a valuable marker for reconstructing variations in the oxygen isotope composition of the Mesozoic oceans, paving the way to enhance our understanding of the environment and climate of this period in Earths history.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

Here, we demonstrate that the same genetic pathway that creates giant cells in sepals is also responsible for their formation in the leaf epidermis. In both sepals and leaves, giant cells are scattered among smaller cells; therefore, we asked whether the spatial arrangement of giant cells is random. By comparing sepal and leaf epidermises with computationally generated randomized tissues we show that giant cells are clustered more than is expected by chance. Our cell-autonomous and stochastic computational model recapitulates the observed giant cell clustering, indicating that clustering emerges as a result of the cell division pattern. Overall, cell size patterning is developmentally regulated by common mechanisms in leaves and sepals rather than a simple byproduct of cell growth.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688184

This approach uses the increased abundance of p53 protein in TP53 mutant cancer cells to concentrate toxic molecules in these cells. We demonstrate the first generalizable strategy using a small molecule to selectively kill TP53 mutant cells. This molecule binds the Y220C mutant of p53 and concentrates a PLK1 inhibitor in cells harboring TP53 Y220C mutations.

Additionally, we conducted a signalling pathway enrichment analysis to identify key pathways involved in radiotherapy resistance and sensitivity. Our findings show that radiotherapy improves survival outcomes in certain cancer types, such as GBM, while worsening outcomes in others, such as LGG. Next, we focused on exploring the differences in radiotherapy outcomes between GBM and LGG, focusing on the molecular mechanisms contributing to these variations. The differential regulation of pathways related to programmed cell death, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, chromosome condensation, antiviral responses, and interferon signaling between GBM and LGG patients may elucidate the underlying reasons for these observed differences. These insights underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches and the need for further research to improve radiotherapy outcomes in cancer patients.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688184

CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, [1]) is a novel enzyme-tethering method for epigenomic profiling, initially developed for mammalian cells. CUT&Tag has several advantages compared to the most commonly used epigenomic profiling methods such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). CUT&Tag allows epigenenomic profiling from a much less amount of starting material compared to ChIP-seq. CUT&Tag is based on the in situ cleavage of DNA by enzymes tethered to antibodies, while in ChIP-seq, the cleavage is done by a nearly random fragmentation step. In theory, this difference in the way of cleaving DNA allows CUT&Tag to reach a higher resolution compared to ChIP-seq. Therefore, CUT&Tag holds the potential to profile the genome-wide distribution at a high resolution even from a small amount of plant tissues. Results: We profiled the genome-wide distribution of three histone modifications, H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, from a few seedlings of Arabidopsis that weighed around 0.01 grams. By comparing the H3K27me3 profiles generated from ChIP-seq and CUT&Tag, we showed that CUT&Tag and ChIP-seq capture the same broad lines of the epigenomes, but they also revealed different sets of peaks. Analysis using the CUT&Tag datasets for the three histone modifications revealed their genomic locations and their relationship with the gene expression level, which are consistent with the expected effect of these histone marks on gene transcription. By comparing to the nucleosome occupancy data, we show that CUT&Tag reached nucleosomal resolution, a much higher resolution than ChIP-seq. In the end, we presented that the increased resolution of CUT&Tag could better reveal the exon enrichment of histone modifications and the epigenetic states of the +1 nucleosome, showing benefits and advantages that this technique could bring to the field of plant epigenetics and chromatin study in general. Conclusion: CUT&Tag is a valid, easy-to-perform, cost-effective, and reliable approach for efficient epigenomic profiling in Arabidopsis, even with limited amount of starting material and provides a higher resolution compared to ChIP-seq. Because the CUT&Tag protocol starting input is isolated nuclei, it is also applicable to other model and non-model plants.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688184

The most lethal manifestation is invasive aspergillosis for which treatment relies on triazoles. Triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus can be recovered from decaying plant material and so-called hotspots containing triazole fungicide residues. Although observations have shown clonal isolates between the environment and clinical samples, a direct link between a specific environment and cases of triazole-resistant invasive aspergillus disease in an individual patient has not yet been demonstrated. Methods: To understand where patients acquire Aspergillus fumigatus isolates causing disease, we used a genomic epidemiology approach with 157 Dutch Aspergillus fumigatus isolates, based on whole genome sequencing. Isolates were from three well-characterized environmental hotspots and two hospitals between 2016 and 2019. Findings: In the Dutch dataset, Aspergillus fumigatus isolates from six patients showed near-identical genomes compared to five environmental isolates. One environmental isolate matched three probable cases of triazole-resistant invasive aspergillosis, including one fatal case. Patient isolates were recovered up to 34 months later than near-identical environmental isolates. Comparison to over 1,2K global publicly available Aspergillus fumigatus genomes showed hundreds of clonal groups spread across three continents. In addition, finding variants associated with resistance to non-triazole fungicides such as benzimidazole, succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor and quinone outside inhibitor classes, strongly suggests an exposure history to multiple agricultural fungicides in these environmental hotspots. Interpretation: Environmental hotspots represent highly selective habitats for multi-fungicide-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus, which we can now directly link to probable cases of aspergillus disease, including a triazole-resistant case. However, geographically widely dispersed clonal expansion limits the utility of genomic epidemiology to identify the source of a particular patients isolate. Furthermore, reducing a single class of fungicides in agriculture may not effectively reduce resistance selection when other classes are still in use.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

The diversification of quinones, from low redox potential in anaerobes to HPQs in aerobes, is assumed to have followed Earths surface oxygenation [~]2.3 billion years ago. However, the evolutionary origins of HPQs remain unresolved. Here, we reconstruct the biosynthetic pathway of a novel HPQ, methyl-plastoquinone, that is unique to bacteria of the phylum Nitrospirota. We demonstrate that the three extant HPQ biosynthetic pathways, in Nitrospirota, Cyanobacteriota, and Pseudomonadota, share a common origin that predates the emergence of these phyla. We show that aerobic metabolism using HPQs is ancestral to Cyanobacteriota and Pseudomonadota and significantly predates Earths surface oxygenation.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations.

MethodsA large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1722463688184

They form superhelical structures around which DNA is wrapped. Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1722463688184
