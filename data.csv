The predictive role of gut microbiome composition during acute infection in the development of LC is not well understood, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of disease. We conducted a longitudinal study of 799 outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 (380 positive, 419 negative) and found that individuals who later developed LC harbored distinct gut microbiome compositions during acute infection, compared with both SARS-CoV-positive individuals who did not develop LC and negative controls with similar symptomatology. However, the temporal changes in gut microbiome composition between the infectious (0-1 month) and post-infectious (1-2 months) phases was not different between study groups. Using machine learning, we showed that microbiome composition alone more accurately predicted LC than clinical variables. Including clinical data only marginally enhanced this prediction, suggesting that microbiome profiles during acute infection may reflect underlying health status and immune responses thus, help predicting individuals at risk for LC. Finally, we identified four LC symptom clusters, with gastrointestinal and fatigue-only groups most strongly linked to gut microbiome alterations.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Conversely, methods that infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) do not consider the dynamically changing nature of biological systems. To integrate these two currently disconnected fields, we present RegVelo, an end-to-end dynamic, interpretable, and actionable deep learning model that learns a joint model of splicing kinetics and gene regulatory relationships and allows us to perform in silico perturbation predictions. When applied to datasets of the cell cycle, human hematopoiesis, and murine pancreatic endocrinogenesis, RegVelo demonstrates superior predictive power for interactions and perturbation simulations, for example, compared to methods that focus solely on dynamics or GRN inference. To leverage RegVelo's full potential, we studied the dynamics of zebrafish neural crest development and underlying regulatory mechanisms using our Smart-seq3 dataset and shared gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements. Using RegVelo's in silico perturbation predictions, validated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and single-cell Perturb-seq, we establish transcription factor tfec as an early driver and elf1 as a novel regulator of pigment cell fate and propose a gene-regulatory circuit involving tfec and elf1 interactions via the toggle-switch model.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

MethodsUsing a population-based panel study of 9,820 adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large, integrated healthcare system, we compared survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness with presence of an ME/CFS diagnosis in the electronic health record (EHR) to evaluate ME/CFS underdiagnosis.

ResultsOf those with survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness, an estimated 97.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.1%-98.4%) did not have an ME/CFS diagnosis in the EHR. The group without EHR diagnosis was younger, less likely to identify as white non-Hispanic, and more likely to have developed fatigue in the past three years than the EHR diagnosed group. Both diagnosed and undiagnosed ME/CFS-like illness groups had significantly impaired physical, cognitive, and social functioning, and significantly worse mental health and anxiety than those without ME/CFS-like illness.

ConclusionME/CFS is underdiagnosed in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system. Enhanced syndromic surveillance that characterizes patients with ME/CFS who have not been diagnosed has the potential to increase timely recognition of ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401909

Using a suite of experimental and computational multiscale approaches, we found that aortic expansion is guided by specific biological principles and scales with the vertebral column rather than animal body weight. Expansion proceeds via two distinct waves of arterial cell proliferation along blood flow that are spatially stochastic, yet temporally coordinated. Each wave exhibits unique cell cycle kinetics and properties, with the first wave exhibiting cell cycle durations as fast as 6 hours. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed changes in fatty acid metabolism concomitant with an increase in cell size. Mathematical modeling and experiments indicated endothelial cell extrusion is essential for homeostatic aortic growth and balancing excess proliferation. In a genetic model of achondroplasia, the aorta achieves proper scaling through enhanced cell extrusion while maintaining normal proliferation dynamics. Collectively, these results provide a blueprint of the principles that orchestrate aortic growth which depends entirely on differentiated cell proliferation rather than resident stem cells.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

However, creating high-quality genomic FMs from scratch is resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and high-quality pre-training data. The success of large language models (LLMs) in NLP has largely been driven by industrial-scale efforts leveraging vast, diverse corpora and massive computing infrastructure. In this work, we aim to bypass the data and computational bottlenecks of creating genomic FMs from scratch and instead propose repurposing existing LLMs for genomics tasks. Inspired by the recently observed 'cross-modal transfer' phenomenon - where transformers pre-trained on natural language can generalize to other modalities - we introduce L2G, which adapts a pre-trained LLM architecture for genomics using neural architecture search (NAS) and a novel three-stage training procedure. Remarkably, without requiring extensive pre-training on DNA sequence data, L2G achieves superior performance to fine-tuned genomic FMs and task-specific models on more than half of tasks across multiple genomics benchmarks. In an enhancer activity prediction task, L2G further demonstrates its capacity to identify significant transcription factor motifs. Our work not only highlights the generalizability and efficacy of language models in out-of-domain tasks such as genomics, but also opens new avenues for more efficient and less resource-intensive methodologies in genomic research.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Extensive intra- and intermolecular A-minor interactions, kissing loops, an unusual A-A helix, and other interactions stabilize the three complexes. Sequence covariation analysis of these large RNAs reveals evolutionary conservation of intermolecular interactions, supporting the biological importance of large, ornate RNA quaternary structures that can assemble without any involvement of proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Identifying organisms that can serve as biomonitors of lead contamination and models to understand mechanisms of lead tolerance is therefore an important goal. We used the Cuban brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) in New Orleans, USA, to investigate the consequences of variation in environmental lead exposure at the physiological and gene regulatory levels. We found that brown anole blood lead levels are associated with soil lead contamination, and that their blood lead levels are extreme. At our most contaminated site, the mean and highest individual blood lead levels were over two times higher than the next highest values reported in free-living vertebrates. However, this lead exposure did not decrease performance in whole-organism traits commonly affected by lead (balance, sprint speed, endurance). A 60-day lead dosing experiment demonstrated that the brown anole blood lead threshold for decreased whole-organism performance is actually an order of magnitude higher than the highest mean field concentration. Transcriptomic analysis of brain and liver from lizards in high and low lead sites revealed relatively minor effects of lead exposure. However, several of the differentially expressed genes function in metal ion homeostasis and oxygen carrying capacity, pointing to cellular mechanisms that may contribute to high lead tolerance. The brown anole may be the most lead-tolerant vertebrate known to date and has the potential to be a powerful model system to help us better understand how organisms cope with heavy metal exposure.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Sex chromosomes in the plant family Cannabaceae, which includes species like hops and hemp, were identified a century ago because of their obviously heteromorphic XYs. However, we know very little about their structure, nor their role in the development of the economically, medicinally, and culturally important flowers. Here we assembled genomes, with phased sex chromosomes, for three XY male hops (Humulus sp.), two XY male Cannabis, and two monoecious Cannabis individuals. Most of the non-recombining regions evolved prior to the divergence between Cannabis and Humulus around 47 MYA supporting this sex chromosome origin is among the oldest known in flowering plants. The Y chromosomes are highly-degenerate, with very few genes remaining, and show substantial rearrangements, while the X also shows faster rates of molecular evolution. The Cannabaceae sex chromosomes contain critical genes for flower development and the production of key compounds like bitter acids and cannabinoids, which are important traits for the plants. The sex chromosomes thus have played a vital role in the domestication and breeding of these species, and more generally, the Cannabaceae family.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

In winter 2022/23 we ran a pilot study aiming to introduce multiplex testing to determine the incidence and burden of SARS-CoV-2, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in our cohort of UK healthcare workers (HCWs).

MethodsThe pilot study was conducted from 28/11/2022-31/03/2023 within the SIREN prospective cohort study. Participants completed fortnightly questionnaires, capturing symptoms and sick leave, and multiplex PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV, regardless of symptoms. PCR-positivity rates by virus were calculated over time, and viruses were compared by symptoms and severity. Self-reported symptoms and associated sick leave were described. Sick leave rates were compared by vaccination status and demographics.

Results5,863 participants were included, 84.6% female, 70.3% [&ge;]45-years, and 33.4% were nurses. PCR-positivity peaked in early December for all three viruses (4.6 positives per 100 tests (95%CI 3.5, 5.7) SARS-CoV-2, 3.9 (95%CI 2.2, 5.6) influenza, 1.4 (95%CI 0.4, 2.4) RSV), declining to <0.3/100 tests after January for influenza/RSV, and around 2.5/100 tests for SARS-CoV-2. Over one-third of all infections were asymptomatic, and symptoms were similar for all viruses. 1,368 (23.3%) participants reported taking sick leave, median 4 days (range 1-59). Rates of sick leave were higher in participants with co-morbidities, working in clinical settings, and who had not been vaccinated (COVID-19 booster or seasonal influenza vaccine) versus those who had received neither vaccine (2.04 vs 1.41 sick days/100 days, adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio 1.47 (95%CI 1.38, 1.56).

ConclusionThis pilot demonstrated the use of multiplex testing allowed better understanding of the impact of seasonal respiratory viruses and respective vaccines on the HCW workforce. This highlights the important information on asymptomatic infection and persisting levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401909

In Australia, they are considered exotic biosecurity threats, and an incursion of these viruses would require rapid and strict control efforts. However, current surveillance methods for these viruses are limited. We examined whether RMV and related tobamoviruses could be detected by deep sequencing of gut metatranscriptomes of vertebrate animals and ticks. Using this method, we discovered that RMV, as well as a novel relative of RMV, and two highly diverse novel tobamoviruses are present in Australia. RMV was detected in multiple sites in both the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Tasmania, two regions separated by approximately 700km of land and 200km of water. The novel relative of RMV was detected in the ACT and New South Wales (NSW), while the highly divergent novel tobamoviruses were each detected in a single state, NSW and Queensland (QLD). In addition, Tobacco mild green mosaic virus, which is already known to be present in Australia, was detected in QLD using this method.

We call this platform IN-vivo Tracking of ACtive Transcription, or INTACT. In INTACT, when the target mRNA is expressed, the RNA sensor detects it and triggers the production and release of RMA reporters into the blood. Once in blood, the RMAs can be easily measured through a simple blood draw. Our data shows that INTACT can measure transcription of transgenes, as well as endogenous transcripts, such as c-Fos or Arc, both in vivo in the brain and in tissue culture.

Here, we introduce the universal single-copy knock-in system (Universal SKI System or U-SKI), designed for inserting any transgene by CRISPR/Cas9 in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. The Universal SKI System takes advantage of a plasmid (pSKI), which can also be used for extrachromosomal arrays, to facilitate the insertion of a transgene at specific safe harbor loci on each autosomal chromosome. The pSKI plasmid contains multiple restriction sites for easy cloning and serves as a CRISPR/Cas9-based insertion repair template because it has two synthetic and long homology arms that recombine with the SKI cassettes. This system also uses a single crRNA guide, which acts as a Co-CRISPR enrichment marker. Overall, the Universal SKI System is highly flexible; with the same Universal SKI cassette on each autosome, researchers can select the insertion site and streamline tracking while reducing the complexity of expressing single-copy transgenes in C. elegans.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Merging scRNAseq with population genomic data, we show that cell types differ in the rate at which their characteristic genes evolve, as measured by allele frequency divergence among many populations (FST) and between species (dN/dS ratios). Neutrophils, B cells, and fibroblasts exhibit elevated FST at characteristic genes, while eosinophils in the intestine and thrombocytes in the head kidney exhibit lower FST than the average for 1000 random genes. Gene network centrality also differed between immune- and non-immune-associated genes, and closeness centrality was positively related to gene FST. These results highlight the value of merging single cell RNA sequencing technology with evolutionary population genomic data, and reveal that genes which define immune cell types exhibit especially rapid evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Recent analytical breakthroughs and theoretical developments rely on phase maintenance of oscillatory signals without considering whether or not this assumption is met. Lagged (auto)coherence, the coherence between a signal and itself at increasing temporal delays, has been proposed as a way to quantify the rhythmicity, or periodicity, of a signal. However, current Fourier-based lagged autocoherence algorithms suffer from poor spectral accuracy and resolution, aliasing effects that become more pronounced at higher frequencies, and conflation with amplitude covariation, especially in frequency ranges in which the signal power is low. We introduce a continuous lagged autocoherence metric, lagged Hilbert autocoherence, that addresses these shortcomings by using multiplication in the frequency domain for precise bandpass filtering, instantaneous analytic signals via the Hilbert transform, and thresholding using the amplitude covariation of surrogate data generated by an autoregressive model. We show that this version of lagged coherence yields vastly higher spectral accuracy and resolution than lagged Fourier autocoherence, and that this unlocks additional, increasingly fine-grained applications. This includes examination of: 1) frequency-specific differences in rhythmicity between conditions, 2) changes in signal rhythmicity during learning, and 3) the relationship between frequency-specific rhythmicity and behavior, trial-by-trial. Lagged Hilbert autocoherence thus offers a significant toolset advancement for analysis of neurophysiological rhythmicity.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

We studied three signal processing methods (i.e., artifact subspace reconstruction, surface Laplacian filtering, and data normalization), four feature extractors (i.e., common spatial patterns, independent component analysis, short-time Fourier transform, and no feature extraction), and four machine learning classifiers (i.e., support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory networks). Using a large-scale EEG dataset, we optimized each combination for individual subjects (i.e., resulting in 672 total experiments) and evaluated performance based on classification accuracy. We also compared the computational and memory storage requirements, which are important for real-time embedded computing.

A key determinant of P. aeruginosa virulence is the regulated synthesis and release of extracellular products, which is controlled by a cell density-dependent signaling system known as quorum sensing (QS). P. aeruginosa uses a complex QS network, including two systems that rely on diffusible N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules. The LuxR-type receptor RhlR is unique in that it requires not only its cognate AHL but also the accessory protein PqsE to maximally bind to promoter DNA and to initiate transcription. Our group demonstrated that PqsE physically interacts with RhlR, enhancing its affinity for target promoters across the P. aeruginosa genome. Although LuxR-type receptors are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria and important for pathogenesis, PqsE orthologs are restricted to Pseudomonas and Burkholderia species. This study explored the conservation of PqsE and examined PqsE ortholog structure-function across different species. Our results show that PqsE in Pseudomonas retain their functional interactions with RhlR homologs, unlike PqsE orthologs in Burkholderia spp., which do not interact with their respective LuxR-type receptors. Additionally, we assessed the AHL preferences of different receptors and hypothesized that the PqsE-RhlR interaction evolved to stabilize the inherently unstable RhlR, preventing its degradation. Indeed, we observe higher levels of RhlR protein turnover in a strain lacking pqsE compared to WT, which can be rescued in a strain of lacking the Lon protease.

IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa, a major pathogen for patients with cystic fibrosis and a primary constituent of healthcare-associated infections, relies on a complex quorum-sensing (QS) network to coordinate virulence factor production. Central to this system is the interaction between two proteins, PqsE and RhlR, which drive gene expression essential for pathogenesis. Our study investigates the conservation of the PqsE-RhlR interaction across related bacterial species, revealing that PqsE in Pseudomonas can enhance RhlR activity, while orthologs in Burkholderia lack this capacity. These findings offer new insights into the specificity and evolution of QS mechanisms, highlighting the PqsE-RhlR interaction as a potentially selective target for treating P. aeruginosa infections.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Research gathered from model species, particularly Arabidopsis thaliana, has revealed that the nuclear auxin pathway controls many of these processes through transcriptional regulation. Recently, a non-transcriptional pathway based on rapid phosphorylation mediated by kinases has been described, complementing the understanding of the complexity of auxin-regulated processes. Phylogenetic inferences of both pathways indicate that only some of the components are conserved beyond land plants. This raises fundamental questions about the evolutionary origin of auxin responses and whether algal sisters share mechanistic features with land plants. Here we explore auxin responses in the unicellular streptophyte alga Penium margaritaceum. By assessing physiological, transcriptomic and cellular responses we found that auxin triggers cell proliferation, gene regulation and acceleration of cytoplasmic streaming. Notably, all these responses are also triggered by the structurally related tryptophan. These results identify shared auxin response features among land plants and algae, and suggest that less chemically specific responses preceded the emergence of auxin-specific regulatory networks in land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

We also provide faster computational routines for estimating both consensus trees in an updated version of TreeAnnotator X, an open-source software program that summarizes the information from a sample of trees and returns many helpful statistics such as individual clade credibilities contained in the consensus tree.

Our study reveals that, among these resources, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP1) transporter to exploit the Golgi-bound phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) pool. This leads to a depletion of Golgi-resident PI4P, triggering the activation of the ATM DNA Damage Response (DDR) kinase in the cytoplasm. As such, ATM, typically anchored to PI4P at the Golgi in an inactive state, undergoes auto-phosphorylation and cytoplasmic release upon SARS-CoV-2-induced PI4P depletion. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of ATM auto-phosphorylation, which stabilizes its interaction with PI4P, significantly impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication. The requirement for PI4P and impact of ATM inhibition might be conserved across coronaviruses, as similar effects were observed with HCoV-229E. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-induced, cytoplasmic ATM pre-activation primes cells for an accelerated response to DNA damage, which might contribute to the severe outcomes of COVID-19 observed in cancer patients undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy. Therefore, this study uncovers a DNA damage-independent mode of ATM activation and highlights the potential of ATM inhibitors as therapeutic agents against COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Many movie-watching studies measure inter-subject correlation (ISC), which refers to the correlation between participants neural activation time series. Previous research has focused on explaining ISC differences during movie-watching based on individual states and traits, such as social distance, personality, and political orientation. For example, friends show higher ISC than strangers while watching movies.

However, movies are not natural categories but cultural artifacts that evoke varying levels of ISC depending on content, directing style, or editing methods. This raises questions about how much trait- or state-like differences in ISC depend on the specific movies chosen, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings across different movies.

Here, we used an fMRI dataset of 112 participants watching eight animated movies to (a) quantify between-movie variability in ISC across the brain and (b) assess the implications for the generalizability of trait- or state-like effects on ISC. We found substantial between-movie variability in ISC, with this variability differing across brain regions. Crucially, brain regions with the highest ISC exhibited the greatest variability, indicating that trait- or state-like differences in ISC from one movie may not generalize to others.

We conclude that variability between movies limits the generalizability of trait- or state-like ISC differences. Using a specific movie in neuroscience should be treated similarly to using a particular task, requiring a comparable characterization of the constituent cognitive elements. Broad generalizations about ""naturalistic imaging"" or ""movie watching"" are not warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Since they can suppress pathogen replication and spread rapidly through insect populations, Wolbachia is at the vanguard of public health initiatives to control mosquito-borne diseases. Wolbachia's abilities to block pathogens and spread quickly are closely linked to their abundance in host tissues. The most common method for counting Wolbachia is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), yet qPCR can be insufficient to count rare Wolbachia, necessitating tissue pooling and consequently compromising individual-level resolution of Wolbachia dynamics. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) offers superior sensitivity, enabling the detection of rare targets and eliminating the need for sample pooling. Here, we report three ddPCR assays to measure total Wolbachia abundance, Wolbachia abundance adjusted for DNA extraction efficiency, and Wolbachia density relative to host genome copies. Using Drosophila melanogaster with wMel Wolbachia as a model, we show these ddPCR assays can reliably detect as few as 7 to 12 Wolbachia gene copies in a 20 L reaction. The designed oligos are homologous to sequences from at least 106 Wolbachia strains across Supergroup A and 53 host species from the Drosophila, Scaptomyza, and Zaprionus genera, suggesting broad utility.

One approach to distinguishing between alternative mechanisms is to study species that reproduce at very young ages, as competing hypotheses make different predictions about patterns of mutation in these organisms. Here, we study the germline mutation rate in the gray short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica, a laboratory model species that becomes reproductively mature at less than six months of age. Whole-genome sequencing of 22 trios reveals the lowest mutation rate per generation found in mammals thus far (0.26 x 10-8 per base pair per generation at an average parental age of 313 days), which is expected given their early reproduction. We also examine the mutation spectrum and find fewer mutations at CpG sites in opossums than in humans, consistent with the lower CpG content in the opossum genome. We observe that two-thirds of mutations are inherited from the male parent in opossums, slightly lower than the degree of male bias observed in organisms that reproduce at much older ages. Nevertheless, the very young age at reproduction in opossums suggests that ongoing spermatogonial divisions in males after puberty are not the primary driver of the observed male mutation bias. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that the differences between male and female germline mutation may arise from mechanisms other than cell division post-puberty.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

In contrast, larger mammals, including humans, show reduced or absent MYH4 expression and type IIb myofibers, favoring slower-contracting myofibers. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying this shift remain unclear. Here, we identify large MAF transcription factors (MAFA, MAFB, MAF) as key regulators of MYH4 expression in large mammals, including human and bovine. Overexpression of large MAFs induces MYH4 expression and enhances glycolytic capacity in human myotubes, supported by RNA-seq and metabolic flux analyses. RNA-seq of human muscle biopsies reveals a positive correlation between MAFA, MAF, and MYH4 expression, with these genes elevated in power-trained individuals. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism across mammals, showing that large MAFs can induce type IIb myofibers even in humans, with potential applications for enhancing athletic performance and addressing age-related muscle weakness associated with the loss of fast-twitch myofibers.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rats (Rattus norvegicus) have been established as an ideal model for studying emotional expression because they reflect internal emotional states. Since the discovery of USVs in rats, it has gradually been revealed that two types of adult rats USVs with distinct acoustic features (high-short and low-long) are closely linked to positive and negative affect, respectively. Thus, for many years, most studies have grouped USVs into dichotomous categories: 50-kHz (positive) USVs and 22-kHz (negative) USVs, using these numbers as labels rather than measured values. However, the diversity of rats USVs may have been overlooked due to this 50- / 22-kHz dichotomous framework, as several recent studies claim to have found new categories in USVs outside the framework. Here, through a systematic survey of descriptions of rats USVs in the past literature, we confirmed a non-negligible number of reports on USVs that are outside the dichotomous framework. Our results support the abundance of diverse USVs beyond the dichotomy. This extends the traditional association between acoustic features and emotional states, highlighting the importance of research on diverse vocalizations that might reflect complex affective states beyond the simple distinction between positive and negative.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) seeks to prioritize chromosomally normal embryos for transfer based on genetic analysis of a biopsy of approximately five trophectoderm cells from blastocyst-stage in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos. While modern PGT-A platforms classify these biopsies as aneuploid, euploid, or mosaic (possessing a mixture of normal and aneuploid cells), the underlying incidences of aneuploid, euploid, and mosaic embryos and the rates of meiotic and mitotic error that produced them remain largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we paired a recent method for embryo simulation with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to infer rates of meiotic and mitotic error that best explain published PGT-A data. By simulating from these posterior distributions, we also evaluated the chromosomal status of entire embryos. For a published clinical sample, we estimated a 39-43% probability of meiotic error per meiosis, as well as a 1.0-3.0% probability of mitotic error per mitosis, depending on assumptions about spatial clustering of aneuploid cells within mosaic embryos. In addition, our analyses suggest that less than 1% of blastocysts are fully euploid, and that many embryos possess low-level mosaic clones that are not captured during biopsy. These broad conclusions were relatively insensitive to potential misclassification of mosaic biopsies. Together, our work helps overcome the limitations of embryo biopsies to estimate the fundamental rates of cell division errors that are the main causes of human pregnancy loss.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

However, directly linking drug efficacy to receptor-mediated activation of specific intracellular transducers and the resulting physiological outcomes remains challenging. It is unclear whether the enhanced therapeutic window of certain drugs -- defined as the dose range that provides effective therapy with minimal side effects -- stems from their low intrinsic efficacy across all signaling pathways or ligand bias, wherein specific transducer subtypes are preferentially activated in a given cellular system compared to a reference ligand. Accurately predicting safer compounds, whether through low intrinsic efficacy or ligand bias, would greatly advance drug development. While AI models hold promise for such predictions, the development of deep learning models capable of reliably forecasting GPCR ligands with defined bioactivities remains challenging, largely due to the limited availability of high-quality data. To address this, we pre-trained a model on receptor sequences and ligand datasets across all class A GPCRs, and then refined it to predict low-efficacy compounds or biased agonists for individual class A GPCRs. This was achieved using transfer learning and a neural network incorporating natural language processing of target sequences and receptor mutation effects on signaling. These two fine-tuned models--one for low-efficacy agonists and one for biased agonists--are available on demand for each class A GPCR and enable virtual screening of large chemical libraries, thereby facilitating the discovery of compounds with potentially improved safety profiles.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

To investigate that, we integrated technological data of blades and bladelets from eastern African contexts (Marine Isotope Stages 5-1) with large-scale paleoclimatic reconstructions. A principal component analysis (PCA) finds the first component (reflecting artifacts dimensions) significantly correlating with time. This highlights a progressive reduction in size over time, a trend that has already been suggested for the MSA-LSA transition. The second principal component reflects artifact shape and shows a significant correlation with seasonality.

Based on this, we propose that more variable blades reflect greater versatility in foraging strategies as adaptation to unpredictable environments. On the other hand, during periods of mild seasonal change, a more standardized toolkit with thinner, longer elements would emerge from refining and adapting to familiar situations and challenges.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Vesicle transfer, especially through extracellular space, has recently been highlighted as a critical intercellular communication modality, carrying nucleic acids, proteins, and others to distant cells. Previously, we demonstrated that extracellular vesicles induce ""phenotypic synchronization of cells (PSyC)"" during stem cell differentiation. While examining the mechanism underlying PSyC, we discovered a novel form of cellular communication mediated by direct intercellular vesicle exchange (DIVE) between adjacent cells across the plasma membrane (PM). By achieving cell-wide, high-spatiotemporal resolution and sustained imaging of vesicles labeled with fusion proteins of CD63 or CD81 to StayGold, a photostable fluorescent marker, we observed small vesicles (50-500 nm in diameter) directly transferred between adjacent cells. These vesicles moved at approximately 1 m/s and crossed PM in approximately 10-20 seconds. Furthermore, multiple vesicles traversed nearly identical positions of PM, suggesting the presence of specific routes or structures, potentially including a pore, mediating the vesicle transfer. Three-dimensional electron microscopy provided supportive observations for traversing vesicles with single membrane, crossing PM. These vesicles, named InterCellular Vesicles (InterCVs), were observed to colocalize with nucleic acids, including mRNA, microRNA, and DNA, suggesting the exchange of nucleic acid-mediated information, potentially inducing PSyC, between adjacent cells. Our discovery, DIVE, reveals a previously unknown modality of cell-cell communication, with the potential to reshape our understanding of cellular biology.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

These prototypic heterochromatin compartments are marked by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). However, its contributions to chromocenter structure and function remain debated. We investigated the role of HP1 by recruiting the activators VP16, p65, and VPR to mouse fibroblast chromocenters and analyzed its silencing activity with a transcription reporter. Upon chromocenter decondensation and transcription activation, interactions of HP1 with chromatin and H3K9 trimethylation remained stable, suggesting stoichiometric binding rather than higher-order assembly. HP1-mediated repression required promoter-proximal binding and effectively suppressed VP16-triggered activation but not the stronger activation by VPR. These observations are explained by a 1D lattice binding model, which conceptualizes chromocenters as arrays of repeat units that can independently switch between silenced and activated states. Our findings provide a quantitative framework that explains how chromocenter organization responds to transcriptional activation while maintaining local heterochromatin features.

However, no regulatoryapproved blood tests are available for the early detection of lung cancer. We aimed to improve the classification of pulmonary nodules to identify malignant ones in a high prevalence patient group. Methods: A study involving 806 participants with undiagnosed nodules larger than 5 mm, identified via CT imaging, focused on assessing nucleosome levels and histone modifications in circulating blood. Nodules were classified as malignant or benign. A logistic regression analysis was performed. For model development, the data were randomly divided into training (n = 483) and validation (n = 121) datasets. The model's performance was then evaluated using a separate testing dataset (n = 202). Results: Among patients, 755 (93.7%) had a tissue diagnosis. The overall malignancy rate in the cohort was 80.4%. For all datasets, the AUCs were as follows: training, 0.74; validation, 0.86; and test, 0.79 (accuracy range: 0.80 to 0.88). Sensitivity showed consistent results across all datasets (0.91, 0.95, and 0.93, respectively), whereas specificity ranged from 0.37 to 0.64. For smaller nodules (5 to 10 mm), the model recorded accuracy values of 0.76, 0.88, and 0.85. Sensitivity values of 0.91, 1.00, and 0.94 further highlight the robust diagnostic capability of the model. The performance of the model across the RADS categories was evaluated, and it demonstrated consistent accuracy. Conclusion: Our EB panel detected non small cell lung cancer early in a high risk patient group with high sensitivity and accuracy. The EB model was particularly effective in identifying high risk lung nodules, including small, part solid, and non solid nodules, and provided further evidence for external validation.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401909

However, it requires access to complex and expensive instrumentation, typically a 300 kV electron cryomicroscope equipped with an energy filter. Simpler and cheaper 200 and 100 kV instruments have been successfully used for single particle cryoEM analyses, which has helped to democratize the technique and broaden access. Here, we set out to investigate if a 200 kV electron cryomicroscope without an energy filter can be utilized for in situ structural studies of mammalian cells by electron cryotomography. We demonstrate that the resulting tomograms of thin edges of U2OS cells are of sufficient quality to annotate the contents of the cell and observe spatial inter-relationships among macromolecules. In particular, we undertook a molecular sociology analysis of lipid droplets and addressed their subcellular distribution and interactions with other organelles. Finally, we examined geographical distribution and scientific output of the two most common electron cryomicroscopy platforms and deduced that 200 kV instruments are heavily underutilized with respect to electron cryotomography applications. Given the favorable ratio of their versatility versus costs we foresee that 200 kV electron cryomicroscopes will become workhorses of local electron cryomicroscopy facilities.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401909

Here we describe a cost-effective methodology, Rapid Amplified Multiplexed-FISH (or RAM-FISH), based on Hybridization Chain Reaction 3.0 for localizing dozens of transcripts in the same sample. This methodology achieves multiplexing by localizing 3 genes per cycle to detect 30 or more genes within a few days.

The automation used here can also be adapted to perform other amplification-based FISH.

Its low cost and accessibility have extended its use across biological topics, from symbiosis to biogeography, and ecology. A successful metabarcoding application depends on accurate and comprehensive reference databases for proper taxonomic assignment. The 18S rRNA gene is the primary genetic marker used for general/broad eukaryotic metabarcoding due to its combination of conserved and hypervariable regions, and the availability of extensive taxonomically-informed reference databases like PR2 and SILVA. Despite its advantages, 18S rRNA has certain limitations at lower taxonomic levels, depending on the lineage. Alternative fast-evolving molecular markers, such as the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, have been adopted as widely used ""barcoding genes"" for eukaryotes due to their resolution to the species level. However, the COI gene lacks a curated taxonomically-informed database covering all eukaryotes, including protists, comparable to those available for 18S rRNA. To address this gap, we introduce eKOI, a curated COI gene database aimed at enhancing the taxonomic annotation and primer design for COI-based metabarcoding at the community level. This database integrates COI gene data from GenBank and mitochondrial genomes that are publicly available, followed by rigorous manual curation to eliminate redundancies and contaminants and to correct taxonomic annotations. We validate using the eKOI database for taxonomic annotation of protists by re-annotating several COI-based metabarcoding studies, revealing previously unidentified biodiversity. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the accuracy of the taxonomic annotations, highlighting the potential of eKOI to uncover new biodiversity in various eukaryotic lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

In this study, we used a dataset of 348,501 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank to determine the GWAS thresholds required for multiple testing corrections when considering rare and common variants in additive and dominant GWAS models. Additionally, we employed conditional and joint (COJO) analysis to quantify the proportion of false significant hits in the GWAS results for 72 traits in the UK Biobank when applying the traditional GWAS cut-off versus our newly proposed p-value thresholds. Overall, the results indicate that the conventional GWAS significance threshold of 5.0 x 10-8 yields a false positive rate of between 20% and 30% in GWAS studies that utilize large sample sizes and less common variants. Instead, a more stringent GWAS p-value threshold of 5.0 x 10-9 is needed when rare variants (with minor allele frequency > 0.1%) are included in the association test for both additive and dominance models within the European ancestry population.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

To what extent is lumen acidification sensed by cytosolic-side molecules that drive endosome maturation? We show here that ""inside-out"" proton signaling through the endosomal Na+/H+ Exchanger 6 (NHE6) activates the late endosome master regulator Rab7. The mechanism involves potent inactivation of the Rab7 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TBC1D5 with decreasing pH. NHE6 interacts with TBC1D5 in a complex with Rab7. Neurons from NHE6-null mice or mice engineered with a selective defect in NHE6 proton efflux exhibit blocked endosome maturation and decreased active Rab7, consistent with an overactive Rab7 GAP. Finally, epistatic knock-down of TBC1D5, thereby reducing Rab7 GAP activity, in NHE6-null neurons rescues Rab7 GTPase cycling and endosome maturation. Importantly, NHE6 is mutated in Christianson Syndrome underscoring the significance of these mechanisms to neurodegeneration. We conclude that lumen acidification regulates pH-dependent Rab GTPase cycling to coordinate late endosome maturation by a process involving proton signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Dysregulation of the dynamic formation of G4s is linked to genomic instability and disease, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we conducted a screen of chromatin-modifying enzymes and identified nine potential inhibitors of G4 formation, including seven that were not previously characterized. Among these, we highlight the role of BAZ2 chromatin remodelers as key suppressors of G4 DNA and G4-related genome instability. Depletion of BAZ2 subunits led to increased G4 formation, especially at transcriptional regulatory elements. BAZ2B was found to associate with G4 loci, suggesting that it plays a direct role in suppressing G4s. While BAZ2-deficient cells exhibited modest genomic instability, treatment with the G4-stabilizing ligand BRACO19 exacerbated double-strand breaks (DSBs), highlighting its utility as a tool to study G4-dependent genome instability. DSB profiling using INDUCE-seq uncovered distinct breakage patterns around G4s, further underscoring the impact of G4s on genome integrity. Notably, we found that within G4s, G repeats were more susceptible to DSBs than loops.

We identified and spatially validated novel and human-specific markers of myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells and unexpectedly heterogeneous perineurial fibroblasts. Nerve-associated leukocytes were diverse with an endoneurial to epineurial macrophage gradient. All PNPs shared a loss of myelinating and an increase in repair Schwann cells and lipid-associated macrophages. Transcriptional changes affected multiple cells outside of the endoneurium across PNPs, suggesting PNPs as  pan-nerve diseases. Spatially, PNPs showed a perineurial hyperplasia and fibrotic dispersion and this was most pronounced in immune-mediated PNPs. We found potential of single cell transcriptomics for supporting the differential diagnosis of PNPs and for their future unbiased diagnostic classification.

Our work takes a step towards answering this question by performing the first large-scale benchmarking of deep video models on representational alignment to the human brain, using publicly available models and a recently released video brain imaging (fMRI) dataset. We disentangle four factors of variation in the models (temporal modeling, classification task, architecture, and training dataset) that affect alignment to the brain, which we measure by conducting Representational Similarity Analysis across multiple brain regions and model layers. We show that temporal modeling is key for alignment to brain regions involved in early visual processing, while a relevant classification task is key for alignment to higher-level regions. Moreover, we identify clear differences between the brain scoring patterns across layers of CNNs and Transformers, and reveal how training dataset biases transfer to alignment with functionally selective brain areas. Additionally, we uncover a negative correlation of computational complexity to brain alignment. Measuring a total of 99 neural networks and 10 human brains watching videos, we aim to forge a path that widens our understanding of temporal and semantic video representations in brains and machines, ideally leading towards more efficient video models and more mechanistic explanations of processing in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

The effect of local cues and tissue microenvironments on cell heterogeneity has been mainly studied at the transcriptional level. However, it is within the subcellular scale - the organelles - that lays the machinery to conduct most metabolic reactions and maintain cells alive, ensuring proper tissue function. How changes in subcellular organization under different microenvironments define the functional diversity of cells within organs remains largely unexplored. Here we determine how organelles adapt to different microenvironments using the mouse liver as model system, in combination with computational approaches and machine-learning. To understand organelle adaptation in response to changing nutritional conditions, we analyzed 3D fluorescent microscopy volumes of liver samples labeled to simultaneously visualize mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets from mice subjected to different diets: a control diet, a high-fat diet, and a control diet plus fasting. A Cellpose based pipeline was implemented for cell and organelle segmentation, which allowed us to measure ~100 different organelle metrics and helped us define subcellular architectures in liver samples at the single cell level. Our results showed that hepatocytes display distinct subcellular architectures within different regions of the liver-close to the central vein, in the middle region, and near the portal vein- and across the various diet groups, thus reflecting their adaptation to specific nutritional inputs. Principal component analysis and clustering of hepatocytes based on organelle signatures revealed 12 different hepatocyte categories within the different experimental groups, highlighting a reduction in hepatocyte heterogeneity under nutritional perturbations. Finally, using single cell organelle signatures exclusively, we generated machine learning models that were able to predict with high accuracy different hepatocyte categories, diet groups, and the stages of MASLD. Our results demonstrate how organelle signatures can be used as hallmarks to define hepatocyte heterogeneity and their adaptation to different nutritional conditions. In the future, our strategy, which combines subcellular resolution imaging of liver volumes and machine learning, could help establish protocols to better define and predict liver disease progression.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Cardiac NCCs play a critical role in heart development by orchestrating outflow tract septation, valve formation, aortic arch artery patterning, parasympathetic innervation, and maturation of the cardiac conduction system. Abnormal migration, proliferation, or differentiation of cardiac NCCs can lead to severe congenital cardiovascular malformations. However, the complexity and timing of early embryonic heart development pose significant challenges to studying the molecular mechanisms underlying NCC-related cardiac pathologies. Here, we present a sophisticated functional model of human heart assembloids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which, for the first time, recapitulates cardiac NCC integration into the human embryonic heart in vitro. NCCs successfully integrated at developmentally relevant stages into heart organoids, and followed developmental trajectories known to occur in the human heart. They demonstrated extensive migration, differentiated into cholinergic neurons capable of generating nerve impulses, and formed mature glial cells. Additionally, they contributed to the mesenchymal populations of the developing outflow tract. Through transcriptomic analysis, we revealed that NCCs acquire molecular features of their cardiac derivatives as heart assembloids develop. NCC-derived parasympathetic neurons formed functional connections with cardiomyocytes, promoting the maturation of the cardiac conduction system. Leveraging this model's cellular complexity and functional maturity, we uncovered that early exposure of NCCs to antidepressants harms the development of NCC derivatives in the context of the developing heart. The commonly prescribed antidepressant Paroxetine disrupted the expression of a critical early neuronal transcription factor, resulting in impaired parasympathetic innervation and functional deficits in cardiac tissue. This advanced heart assembloid model holds great promise for high-throughput drug screening and unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying NCC-related cardiac formation and congenital heart defects.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

In this study, we characterized the electrophysiological and transcriptomic effects of GBP on primary sensory neurons derived from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of ethically consented human donors. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrated that GBP treatment reduced neuronal excitability, with more pronounced effects in multi-firing vs. single-firing neuronal subtypes. Notably, significant donor-specific variability was observed in electrophysiological responsiveness to GBP treatment in vitro. RNA sequencing of DRG tissue from the GBP-responsive donor revealed differences in the transcriptome-wide expression of genes associated with ion transport, synaptic transmission, inflammation, and immune response relative to non-responsive donors. Cross-transcriptomic analyses further showed that GBP treatment counteracted these altered processes, rescuing aberrant gene expression at the pathway level and for several key genes. This study provides a comprehensive electrophysiological and transcriptomic profile of the effects of GBP on human DRG neurons.

Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups.

The genome folding by cohesin and CTCF is considered crucial for enhancer-promoter communication and gene regulation. However, the extent of cohesin and CTCF-dependent looping in global enhancer function and their potential non-architectural roles in gene activation have remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the acute removal of cohesin or CTCF in mouse cells dysregulates hundreds of genes, albeit subtly. Among various possible enhancer types, cohesin almost exclusively facilitates gene activation by one enhancer type--the CBP/p300-dependent enhancers. Interestingly, CTCF plays a dual role, operating both with and without cohesin, and promoting gene activation both in an enhancer-dependent and independent manner. By anchoring cohesin loops, CTCF directs enhancers to specific target genes and prevents their mistargeting. Independently of cohesin and enhancers, CTCF acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor, depending on its precise binding position near promoters. Acting as a canonical transcription activator, CTCF directly activates hundreds of housekeeping genes, including those essential for mammalian cell proliferation. Mechanistically, promoter-bound CTCF controls DNA accessibility and RNA polymerase II recruitment. The transcriptional activator function of CTCF appears unique to vertebrates and is shared by its vertebrate-specific paralog, CTCFL, despite CTCFLs inability to anchor cohesin loops. These findings reveal the scope of cohesin and CTCF in gene regulation, delineate their shared and unique functions, define a specific class of enhancers using cohesin-mediated looping, and establish a crucial function of CTCF in gene regulation independent of its architectural role. The work reconciles conflicting views and provides a unified model for gene regulation by cohesin and CTCF.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

To explore ATG8 specialization, we generated the nonuple{Delta} atg8 mutant lacking all nine ATG8 isoforms. The mutant displayed hypersensitivity to carbon and nitrogen starvation, coupled with defects in bulk and selective autophagy as shown by biochemical and ultrastructural analyses. Complementation experiments demonstrated that ATG8A could rescue both carbon and nitrogen starvation phenotypes, whereas ATG8H could only complement carbon starvation. Proximity labeling proteomics further identified isoform-specific interactors under nitrogen starvation, underscoring their functional divergence. These findings provide genetic evidence for functional specialization of ATG8 isoforms in plants and lay the foundation for investigating their roles in diverse cell types and stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

To learn about causal genes and mechanisms at the remaining loci, we created a unified single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) map in peripheral blood comprising a total of 282,424 cells from 48 individuals. Clustering and topic modeling of scATAC data identified discrete cell-types and continuous cell states, which helped reveal disease relevant cellular contexts, and allowed mapping of genetic effects on chromatin accessibility across these contexts. We identified 37,390 chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTL) at 10% FDR across eight cell groups and observed extensive sharing of caQTLs across immune cell contexts, finding that fewer than 20% of caQTLs are specific to a single cell type. Notably, caQTLs colocalized with ~50% more GWAS loci compared to eQTLs, helping to nominate putative causal genes for many unexplained loci. However, most GWAS-caQTL colocalizations had no detectable downstream regulatory effects on gene expression levels in the same cell type. We find evidence that the higher rates of colocalization between caQTLs and GWAS signals reflect missing disease-relevant cellular contexts among existing eQTL studies. Thus, there remains a pressing need for identifying disease-causing cellular contexts and for mapping gene regulatory variation in these cells.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401910

In this work we tested the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) viral infection accelerates the development of AD pathology in mouse models of AD. We profiled transcriptomic changes using transgenic APP/PSEN1 and P301S mouse models that develop AD pathology and k18hACE2 mice that express the humanized ACE2 receptor used by SCV2 to enter cells. This study identified the interferon and chemokine responses constituting key shared pathways between SCV2 infection and the development of AD pathology. Two transgenic mouse models of AD: APP/PSEN1 (develops amyloid pathology) and 3xTg AD (develops both amyloid and tau pathology) were crossed with k18-hACE2 mice to generate hybrid hACE2-3xTg and hACE2-APP/PSEN1 mice. Neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition in the brain of infected mice were imaged in vivo using molecular MRI (mMRI) probes and confirmed postmortem by histopathology. Results show that 11-14-month-old SCV2 infected hACE2-3xTg mice exhibit neuroinflammation 10 days post infection and 4-5-month-old hACE2-APP/PS1 hybrid mice develop amyloid deposits, while age-matched uninfected mice exhibit neither phenotype.

SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the alveolar epithelial barrier and exacerbates airway inflammation, leading to acute respiratory failure, but the molecular details remain unclear. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurological symptoms, potentially due to its weakly understood ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The viral multifunctional Envelope (E) protein is crucial for its virulence, playing a key role in virus assembly, budding, and release. The E protein contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) that interacts with host PDZ domain-containing proteins, potentially affecting host signaling pathways and contributing to pathogenicity. This study focuses on the E protein PBM and its role in virulence, disrupting respiratory epithelial barriers and exacerbating airway inflammation. We generated recombinant mutant viruses lacking the PBM and conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments to elucidate its impact on viral fitness, pathogenicity, and effects on the epithelial integrity. In vitro, the viral mutants showed delayed replication and reduced cytopathic effects. In vivo, experiments with hamsters revealed that PBM-deficient viruses caused less weight loss, lower viral loads, and reduced inflammation, indicating decreased pathogenicity. Histological analyses confirmed less airway damage in these hamsters compared to those infected with the wild-type virus. Additionally, PBM-deficient viruses had impaired interactions with tight junction proteins like ZO-1, a PDZ-containing protein, crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Our findings also demonstrate that the PBM does not play a significant role in neuroinvasion during the acute phase of infection, as evidenced by comparable viral RNA loads across brain regions in infected hamsters, regardless of PBM presence. Histopathological and transcriptomic analyses further support this observation, suggesting that the PBM primarily affects specific epithelial barriers. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis on lung and brainstem from infected hamsters reveals that the PBM modulates inflammatory and immune responses, with a stronger impact in lung tissue than in the brainstem. PBM-deficient viruses induce lower levels of inflammation and cytokine expression, suggesting PBM's specific role in enhancing viral pathogenicity through the activation of pathways such as NF-KB and TNF. Thus, the E protein PBM plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2's fitness, virulence, and pathogenicity, through the disruption of cell junctions and inflammation, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Vegetation metabarcoding revealed a shift in plant community coinciding with beaver establishment in these two sub-alpine lakes, as well as an increase in taxonomic diversity.

However, the resulting data is highly sparse with most data entries being zeros. As such, currently available computational methods for scATAC-seq feature a range of transformation procedures to extract meaningful information from the sparse data. Most notably, these transformations can be categorized into: 1) feature aggregation with known biological associations, 2) pseudo-bulking cells of similar biology, and 3) binarisation of count data. These strategies beg the question of whether or not scATAC-seq data actually has usable single-cell and single-region information as intended from the assay. If we can go beyond aggregated features and pooled cells, it opens up the possibility of more complex statistical tasks that require that degree of granularity. To reach the finest possible resolution of single-cell, single-region information there are inevitably many computational challenges to overcome. Here, we review the major data analysis challenges lying between raw data readout and biological discovery, and discuss the limitations of current data analysis approaches. Lastly, we conclude that chromatin accessibility profiling at true single-cell resolution is not yet achieved with current technology, but that it may be achieved with promising developments in optimising the efficiency of scATAC-seq assays.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Multiple RV association tests are available to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype, but most are restricted to per-gene models and do not fully leverage the availability of variant-level functional annotations. We propose Genome-wide Rare Variant EnRichment Evaluation (gruyere), a Bayesian probabilistic model that complements existing methods by learning global, trait-specific weights for functional annotations to improve variant prioritization. We apply gruyere to WGS data from the Alzheimers Disease (AD) Sequencing Project, consisting of 7,966 cases and 13,412 controls, to identify AD-associated genes and annotations. Growing evidence suggests that disruption of microglial regulation is a key contributor to AD risk, yet existing methods have not had sufficient power to examine rare non-coding effects that incorporate such cell-type specific information. To address this gap, we 1) use predicted enhancer and promoter regions in microglia and other potentially relevant cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) to define per-gene non-coding RV test sets and 2) include cell-type specific variant effect predictions (VEPs) as functional annotations. gruyere identifies 15 significant genetic associations not detected by other RV methods and finds deep learning-based VEPs for splicing, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state are highly predictive of functional non-coding RVs. Our study establishes a novel and robust framework incorporating functional annotations, coding RVs, and cell-type associated non-coding RVs, to perform genome-wide association tests, uncovering AD-relevant genes and annotations.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401910

Here, we introduce KGWAS, a novel geometric deep learning method that leverages a massive functional knowledge graph across variants and genes to improve detection power in small-cohort GWASs significantly. KGWAS assesses the strength of a variants association to disease based on the aggregate GWAS evidence across molecular elements interacting with the variant within the knowledge graph. Comprehensive simulations and replication experiments showed that, for small sample sizes (N=1-10K), KGWAS identified up to 100% more statistically significant associations than state-of-the-art GWAS methods and achieved the same statistical power with up to 2.67x fewer samples. We applied KGWAS to 554 uncommon UK Biobank diseases (Ncase <5K) and identified 183 more associations (46.9% improvement) than the original GWAS, where the gain further increases to 79.8% for 141 rare diseases (Ncase <300). The KGWAS-only discoveries are supported by abundant functional evidence, such as rs2155219 (on 11q13) associated with ulcerative colitis potentially via regulating LRRC32 expression in CD4+ regulatory T cells, and rs7312765 (on 12q12) associated with the rare disease myasthenia gravis potentially via regulating PPHLN1 expression in neuron-related cell types. Furthermore, KGWAS consistently improves downstream analyses such as identifying disease-specific network links for interpreting GWAS variants, identifying disease-associated genes, and identifying disease-relevant cell populations. Overall, KGWAS is a flexible and powerful AI model that integrates growing functional genomics data to discover novel variants, genes, cells, and networks, especially valuable for small cohort diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401910

Yet, how waves alter gene expression in immature RGCs is poorly understood, particularly at the level of the many distinct types of RGCs that underlie the retinas ability to encode diverse visual features. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on RGCs isolated at the end of the first postnatal week from wild-type (WT) mice and {beta}2KO mice, which lack the {beta}2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, leading to the disruption of cholinergic retinal waves. Statistical comparisons of RGC transcriptomes between the two conditions reveal a weak impact of retinal waves on RGC diversity, indicating that retinal waves do not influence the molecular programs that instruct RGC differentiation and maturation.

Gene ontology analyses have repeatedly identified enrichment of proteins with annotated functions in gene expression regulation and neuronal communication. However, proteins are often pleiotropic and these annotations are inherently incomplete. Our recent autism functional genetics work has suggested that these genes may share a common mechanism at the cilium, a membrane-bound organelle critical for neurogenesis, brain patterning, and neuronal activity-all processes strongly implicated in autism. Moreover, autism commonly co-occurs with conditions that are known to involve ciliary-related pathologies, including congenital heart disease, hydrocephalus, and blindness. However, the role of autism genes at the cilium has not been systematically investigated. Here we demonstrate that autism proteins spanning disparate functional annotations converge in expression, localization, and function at cilia, and that patients with pathogenic variants in these genes have cilia-related co-occurring conditions and biomarkers of disrupted ciliary function. This degree of convergence among genes spanning diverse functional annotations strongly suggests that cilia are relevant to autism, as well as to commonly co-occurring conditions, and that this organelle should be explored further for therapeutic potential.

We conducted a longitudinal study in 47 households reporting people with COVID-19 in Texas in January-July 2022, during the first Omicron wave. We evaluated 105 people and 100 of their companion animals by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 at three sequential sampling events 1-2 weeks apart, starting 0-5 days after the first reported diagnosis of COVID-19 in the house. Of 47 households that reported people with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 43, with 68% of people testing positive by RT-qPCR; 95.5% of people had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Dogs were the only animal species positive by RT-qPCR (5.4%; 3/55). Viral copies were consistently lower in dogs than household members, and no infectious virus was recovered in cell culture. Whole genome sequencing revealed household clusters of Omicron subvariants BA.1.1, BA.2.3.4 and BA.5.1.1 in people, dogs and a food bowl, confirming human-to-dog transmission within households, with no evidence of onward transmission from the infected dogs. Eleven dogs (n = 55) and two cats (n = 26) had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Infection was not associated with clinical signs in pets; only two animals that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 were reported to be sick. Nearly one-third (30.2%) of households with active COVID-19 had pets exposed to SARS-CoV-2, similar to our pre-Omicron studies, yet incidence of infection in cats was lower compared to pre-Omicron. These differences suggest that the zoonotic transmission dynamics in households may differ based on variant.

Significance statementMonitoring companion animals offer insights into the zoonotic potential of SARS-CoV-2 ahead of its introduction into other animal populations where viral spread may go unchecked. At the peak of the first Omicron wave, we assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in households longitudinally testing people and their pets in Texas. Omicron infections in cats were significantly lower when compared to pre-Omicron variants. Whole genome sequencing revealed three household clusters of human-to-dog transmission, each with a different Omicron subvariant, yet we did not find evidence of onward transmission to other animals or humans from infected dogs. Sustained animal surveillance in at-risk animals and people using the One Health approach are critical given the ongoing potential for viral evolution that can impact public health.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401910

The challenge remains to efficiently apply precision breeding methods to plant gene regulation. Endogenous gene regulatory sequences are subject to complex transcriptional control, a bottleneck in altering gene expression patterns in a predictable way. Here we present the CRE.AI.TIVE platform, enabling upregulation of plant gene activity without a priori knowledge of individual cis-regulatory elements or their specific location. A predictive machine learning model underpinning the platform has been trained on a wide range of tissue specific transcriptomic and epigenomic coverage datasets from DNA sequence of 12 plant species, showing competitive performance on RNA-seq coverage prediction across all species. Our platform further combines in silico DNA sequence mutagenesis and a protoplast-based massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA). We demonstrate the platforms functionality by mutagenesis of a proximal promoter of the tomato gene SlbHLH96 which yields predictions of variant gene activity in silico. 2,000 sequence candidates with varying predicted gene expression strength were validated with MPRA in plant protoplasts, identifying variants with significantly upregulated gene activity. A portion of functional sequence variants were further individually evaluated with a fluorescence reporter assay and were observed to contain a new order of known cis-regulatory elements. The CRE.AI.TIVE platform offers a first-of-its-kind scalable method of gene upregulation in plants with native DNA sequences without the need for CRE cataloguing and rational promoter design.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Some people in their eighties have cognitive abilities similar to many 30-year-olds, while others experience significant cognitive decline at a much younger age. The variation in age-related cognitive decline is not arbitrary. Several non-modifiable (e.g. genetic) and potentially modifiable (e.g. high blood pressure, smoking, and hearing loss) risk factors are associated with faster cognitive aging. Beyond these individual-level risk factors, a growing body of evidence has identified associations between cognitive impairment and social, economic, and environmental factors. These associations are even more pronounced in developing countries, notably because of greater disparities in education and socioeconomic status. However, people from these countries are rarely studied in scientific research: a citizen of a high-income country is 37 times more likely to appear in a study in top medical journals than a citizen of a low-income country. Here, we examine the association between sociodemographic factors and cognitive aging trajectories among 715,295 participants in 46 countries. Cognition is assessed using Sea Hero Quest, a spatial navigation video game that predicts spatial ability in the real world. We find that the social, economic, and environmental well-being of older adults, as measured by the Global AgeWatch Index (GAWI), is negatively associated with age-related decline in spatial ability. In particular, the GAWI Health and Environment subscores are strongly correlated with the effect of age on wayfinding performance. We also found that gender differences in spatial navigation skills increase with age, and even more so in countries with greater gender inequality, as estimated by the Gender Inequality Index. Our results show that cognitive aging must be understood as a dynamic, heterogeneous process that is strongly linked to potentially modifiable environmental and social factors.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401910

It is widely accepted that the spread of this language family across Europe from the 5th millennium BP correlates with the expansion and diversification of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the onset of the Bronze Age6,7. However, multiple steppe-derived populations co-existed in Europe during this period, and it remains unclear how these populations diverged and which provided the demographic channels for the ancestral forms of the Italic, Celtic, Greek, and Armenian languages8,9. To investigate the ancestral histories of Indo-European-speaking groups in Southern Europe, we sequenced genomes from 314 ancient individuals from the Mediterranean and surrounding regions, spanning from 5,200 BP to 2,100 BP, and co-analysed these with published genome data. We additionally conducted strontium isotope analyses on 224 of these individuals. We find a deep east-west divide of steppe ancestry in Southern Europe during the Bronze Age. Specifically, we show that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Spain, France, and Italy was mediated by Bell Beaker (BB) populations of Western Europe, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages. In contrast, Armenian and Greek populations acquired steppe ancestry directly from Yamnaya groups of Eastern Europe. These results are consistent with the linguistic Italo-Celtic10,11 and Graeco-Armenian1,12,13 hypotheses accounting for the origins of most Mediterranean Indo-European languages of Classical Antiquity. Our findings thus align with specific linguistic divergence models for the Indo-European language family while contradicting others.

This is more likely to arise when the two SNPs are in relatively close proximity, so while true epistasis between nearby variants could be commonplace, in practice there is no reliable way of telling apart true epistatic signals from false positives. By considering the causes of phantom epistasis from a genealogy-based perspective, we leverage the rich information contained within reconstructed genealogies (in the form of ancestral recombination graphs) to address this problem. We propose a novel method for explicitly quantifying how likely it is that a given pairwise interaction is the result of phantom epistasis, which can be applied to pairs of SNPs regardless of the genetic distance between them. Our method uses only publicly-available data and so does not require access to the phenotypes and genotypes used for detecting interactions. Using simulations, we show that the method has good sensitivity at even low genetic distances (around 0.5cM), and demonstrate its power to detect phantom epistasis using real data from previous studies. This opens up the exciting possibility of distinguishing spurious interactions in cis from those reflecting real biological effects.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

To overcome this limitation, we describe a highly successful, rapid, and generalisable approach that leverages de novo protein design to develop new-to-nature proteins for controlling CRISPR-Cas activity. Using CRISPR-Cas13 as a representative example, we demonstrate that AI-designed anti-CRISPRs (AIcrs) are capable of highly potent and specific inhibition of CRISPR-Cas13 proteins.

However, despite improvements in genome assembly, genome annotation (i.e. the identification of protein-coding genes) remains challenging, particularly for eukaryotic genomes: it requires combining several approaches (typically ab initio, transcriptomics, and homology search), each with its own pros and cons. Deciding which gene models to retain in a consensus is far from trivial, and automated approaches tend to lag behind laborious manual curation efforts in accuracy.

ResultsHere, we present OMAnnotator, a novel approach to building a consensus annotation. OMAnnotator repurposes the OMA algorithm, originally designed to elucidate evolutionary relationships among genes across species, to integrate predictions from different annotation sources, using evolutionary information as a tie-breaker. We validated OMAnnotator by reannotating the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome and comparing it with the expert-curated reference and results from the automated pipelines BRAKER2 and EvidenceModeller. OMAnnotator produced a consensus annotation that outperformed each individual input and surpassed the existing pipelines. Finally, when applied to three recently published genomes, OMAnnotator gave substantial improvements in two cases, and mixed results in the third, which had already benefited from extensive expert curation.

ConclusionWe introduce an original, flexible, and effective approach to annotating genomes by integrating multiple lines of evidence. The methods robustness is underlined by its successful implementation in re-annotating recently published genomes, opening up new avenues in eukaryotic genome annotation.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

They disagreed on the coding status of one of every eight annotated coding genes. The analysis inspired bilateral collaborations between annotation groups.

Here we have repeated our analysis with updated versions of the three reference coding gene sets. Superficially, little appears to have changed. Although there are slightly fewer genes predicted as coding overall, the three groups still disagree on the status of 2,606 annotated genes. However, a comparison without read-through genes and immunoglobulin fragments shows that the three reference sets have merged or reclassified more than 700 genes since the last analysis and that just 0.6% of Ensembl/GENCODE coding genes are not also annotated by the other two reference sets.

We used eight features indicative of non-coding genes to examine the 21,873 coding genes annotated across the three reference sets. We found that more than 2,000 had one or more potential non-coding features. While some of these genes will be protein coding, we believe that most are likely to be non-coding genes or pseudogenes. Our results suggest that annotators still vastly overestimate the number of true coding genes.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Remarkably, SubCell generalizes to other fluorescence microscopy datasets without any finetuning, including dataset of drug-perturbed cells, where SubCell accurately predicts drug perturbations of cancer cells and mechanisms of action. Finally, we construct the first proteome-wide hierarchical map of proteome organization that is directly learned from image data. This vision-based multiscale cell map defines cellular subsystems with large protein-complex resolution, reveals proteins with similar functions, and distinguishes dynamic and stable behaviors within cellular compartments. In conclusion, SubCell enables deep image-driven representations of cellular architecture applicable across diverse biological contexts and datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

To obtain the iron required for growth, many bacterial pathogens encode transporters capable of extracting the iron-containing cofactor heme directly from host proteins. Pathogenic E. coli and Shigella spp. produce the outer membrane transporter ChuA, which binds host hemoglobin and extracts its heme cofactor, before importing heme into the cell. Heme extraction by ChuA is a dynamic process, with the transporter capable of rapidly extracting heme from hemoglobin in the absence of an external energy source, without forming a stable ChuA-hemoglobin complex. In this work, we utilise a combination of structural modelling, Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and phenotypic analysis to understand the mechanistic detail of this process. Based on this understanding we utilise artificial intelligence-based protein design to create binders capable of inhibiting E. coli growth by blocking hemoglobin binding to ChuA. By screening a limited number of these designs, we identify several binders that inhibit E. coli growth at low nanomolar concentrations, without experimental optimisation. We determine the structure of a subset of these binders, alone and in complex with ChuA, demonstrating that they closely match the computational design. This work demonstrates the utility of de novo-designed proteins for inhibiting bacterial nutrient uptake and uses a workflow that could be applied to integral membrane proteins in other organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits.

Here, we examined early signalling responses to single and combined BRAF and MAPK inhibition in a BRAFV600E, drug-sensitive melanoma cell line and a drug-resistant ARID1A-knockout (KO) derivative. ARID1A, frequently mutated in melanoma, is associated with resistance and immune evasion. Using an innovative systems biology approach that integrates transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and functional kinomics through matrix factorization and network analysis, we identified key signalling alterations and resistance mechanisms.

We found that ARID1A-KO cells exhibited transcriptional rewiring, sustaining MAPK1/3 and JNK activity post-treatment, bypassing feedback sensitivity observed in parental cells. This rewiring suppressed PRKD1 activation, increased JUN activity--a central resistance network node--and disrupted PKC dynamics through elevated basal RTKs (e.g., EGFR, ROS1) and Ephrin receptor activity post-treatment. ARID1A mutations also reduced HLA-related protein expression and enriched extracellular matrix components, potentially limiting immune infiltration and reducing immunotherapy efficacy. Our graph-theoretical multi-omics approach uncovered novel resistance-associated signalling pathways, identifying PRKD1, JUN, and NCK1 as critical nodes. While receptor activation redundancies complicate single-target therapies, they also present opportunities for combination strategies.

This study highlights ARID1As role in reshaping signalling and immune interactions, offering new insights into melanoma resistance mechanisms. By identifying actionable targets, including JUN and immune pathways, we provide a foundation for developing integrated therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance in BRAF/MAPK inhibitor-treated melanoma.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying chitin-induced systemic effects in plants remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of soil amendment with crab chitin flakes (hereafter chitin) on pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and systemic disease resistance in various plant species. We found that soil amendment with chitin potentiates PTI and disease resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in lettuce, tomato, and Arabidopsis as well as against the fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis causing powdery mildew in wheat. Using micrografting in Arabidopsis, we demonstrated that this systemic effect is dependent on active chitin perception in the roots. We also showed that induced systemic resistance (ISR) and pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)/co-receptors, but not systemic acquired resistance (SAR), are involved in the systemic effects triggered by chitin soil amendment. This systemic effect correlated with the transcriptional up-regulation of key PTI components in distal leaves upon chitin soil amendment. Notably, chitin-triggered systemic immunity was independent of microbes present in soil or chitin flakes. Together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of chitin-triggered systemic immunity, from active chitin perception in roots to the potentiation of PTI in the leaves, ultimately priming plants to mount enhanced defense responses against pathogen attacks. Our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of chitin soil amendment and resulting induced immunity, and highlights its potential use for sustainable crop protection strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Here, we show CBD and other cannabinoids are potent inhibitors of mechanosensitive two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels, including TRAAK and TREK-1 that contribute to spike propagation in myelinated axons. Five TRAAK mutations that cause epilepsy or the neurodevelopmental syndrome FHEIG (facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis, epilepsy, intellectual/developmental delay, and gingival overgrowth) retain sensitivity to cannabinoid inhibition. A cryo-EM structure reveals CBD binds in the intracellular cavity of TREK-1 to sterically block ion conduction. These results show that cannabinoids and endogenous lipids compete for a common binding site to inhibit channel activity, identify mechanosensitive K2Ps as potential physiological targets of CBD, and suggest cannabinoids could counter gain-of-function in TRAAK channelopathies.

Flagellins with strong agonism bind TLR5 at their D1 and D0 domains, while poor agonist ""silent"" flagellins bind with D1 only. However, D0-TLR5 interactions insufficiently explain the silent phenotype. Here, we characterize the D1 domain binding kinetics of the silent flagellin RhFlaB compared to the strong canonical agonist StFliC. Using Surface Plasmon Resonance, we show that the RhFlaB-D1 binds more strongly than StFliC-D1, but forms shorter-lived complexes. Cryo-EM analysis of RhFlaB showed its D1 primary interface (PI) contains two distinct hydrophobic pockets, which should facilitate rapid association, while its D1s secondary interface (SI) is dominated by negatively charged residues, which likely impede residue-residue interactions. Comparisons with an existing StFliC-D1 structure suggest that strong agonism requires strong binding at both the PI and SI of the D1, and silent flagellins evade detection partly through weaker SI interactions. These findings offer a foundation for designing targeted interventions that can modulate TLR5 activity to influence immunity, inflammation, or even gut microbiome composition.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Pathogens secrete cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) to facilitate plant colonisation, but damaged, infected cells are often a source of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides that trigger host immunity. The mechanisms by which pathogens minimize the release of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides while colonizing the host remain to be elucidated. We combined biochemical, molecular genetics and transcriptomic analyses to functionally characterize a glycoside hydrolase (ZtGH45) from the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. ZtGH45 gene is expressed during the necrotrophic phase of the fungus, coinciding with an accumulation of wheat {beta}-1,3/1,4-mixed-linked glucan (MLG)-derived oligosaccharides. We show that overexpression of ZtGH45 enhances {beta}-1,3/1,4-glucan hydrolysis and the derived oligosaccharides trigger an immune response in wheat, which hinders Z. tritici virulence. The results demonstrate that tight regulation of ZtGH45 is critical for the infection process to prevent early accumulation of MLG oligosaccharides that would prematurely induce host immunity counterbalancing fungal virulence.

During development, DNA content remains constant but cell size evolves, necessitating a mechanism that scales chromosome compaction with cell size. In this study, we examined chromatin compaction in the developing Drosophila nervous system by analyzing the large neuronal stem cells and their smaller progeny, the ganglion mother cells. Using super-resolution 3D Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy and quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we observed that nanoscale chromatin density during interphase scales with nuclear volume according to a power law. This scaling relationship is disrupted by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity, indicating that molecular cues rather than mechanical constraints primarily regulate chromatin compaction. Notably, this power law dependency is maintained into mitosis but the scaling exponent decreases, suggesting phase separation of chromatin events during mitotic compaction. We propose that the scaling of mitotic chromosome size relative to cell size depends on the power law behaviour of interphase chromatin volume, and that scaling of mitotic chromatin compaction is an emergent property of linear polymers undergoing phase separation with their solvent.

Statement of SignificanceUnderstanding how chromatin compaction changes with cell size is essential for understanding the mechanisms ensuring accurate genome segregation during cell division. In this study, we combine Voronoi tessellation analysis of Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy and image processing methods based on fluorescence intensity spectrum analysis of live confocal images to measure chromatin volume in interphase and mitosis in cells of different sizes. This work reveals that chromatin density in Drosophila neuronal cells follows a power law relationship with nuclear volume from interphase through mitosis, suggesting a fundamental principle underlying chromosome scaling across different cell sizes. We show that this scaling is regulated by molecular cues, such as histone deacetylase activity, and is conserved through a potential phase separation during mitosis, providing new insights into the biophysical processes that govern chromatin organization. This work broadens our understanding of chromosome biology and will have implications for understanding size-dependent chromatin dynamics in other organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Such fibrinaloid microclots are also relatively resistant to fibrinolysis. The proteins that the amyloid microclots contained differed markedly both from the soluble proteome of typical plasma and that of normal clots, and also between the disease studies (an acute syndrome in the form of sepsis in an ITU and a chronic disease represented by Long COVID). Many proteins in the amyloid microclots were low in concentration in plasma and were effectively accumulated into the fibres, whereas many other abundant plasma proteins were excluded. The proteins found in the microclots associated with the diseases also tended to be themselves amyloidogenic. We here ask effectively the inverse question. This is: can the clot proteome tell us whether the clots associated with a particular disease contained proteins that are observed uniquely (or are highly over-represented) in known amyloid clots relative to normal clots, and thus were in fact amyloid in nature? The answer is in the affirmative in a variety of major coagulopathies, viz. venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, various cardiac issues, and ischaemic stroke.

Cryptosporidium is an intracellular parasite of intestinal epithelial cells, and a leading cause of diarrheal death and disease in infants worldwide. Despite this, very little is known about the cell biology of infection of this eukaryotic pathogen. Here, we designed and implemented a unique microscopy-based arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 screen to interrogate the effects of the loss of every protein-coding human gene on a Cryptosporidium infection. As the experimental readout is image-based, we extracted multiple phenotypic features of infection, including parasite growth, progression of the parasite to its sexual life stage, and recruitment of host actin to  pedestals beneath the parasite vacuole. Using this dataset, we discovered a tipping point in the host cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that controls Cryptosporidium infection. Parasite growth can either be inhibited or promoted by the intermediary metabolite squalene. A build-up of squalene in epithelial cells creates a reducing environment, with more reduced host glutathione available for uptake by the parasite. Because Cryptosporidium has lost the ability to synthesise glutathione, this uptake from the host cell is required for growth and progression through its life cycle. We demonstrate that this dependency can be leveraged for treatment with the abandoned drug lapaquistat, an inhibitor of host squalene synthase that has efficacy against Cryptosporidium in vitro and in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, these effects are believed to have evolved from parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, which results in opposing parental genetic influences. Despite their potential importance, POEs remain heavily understudied in complex traits, largely due to the lack of parental genomes.

Here, we present a multi-step approach to infer the parent-of-origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging inter-chromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and chromosome X data, and sibling-based crossover inference. Applied to the UK Biobank (discovery cohort) and Estonian Biobank (replication cohort), this scalable approach enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 221,062 individuals, representing the largest dataset of its kind.

GWAS scans for more than 60 complex traits and over 2,400 protein levels contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 novel POEs and confirmed more than 50% of testable known associations. Notably, approximately half of our POEs exhibited a bipolar pattern, where maternal and paternal alleles exert conflicting effects. These effects were particularly prevalent for traits related to growth (e.g., IGF-1, height, fat-free mass) and metabolism (e.g., type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, glucose). Replication in the Estonian Biobank validated over 70% of testable associations.

Overall, our findings shed new light on the influence of POEs on diverse complex traits and align with the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401910

In Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, male gametogenesis mitosis is exceptionally rapid and divergent. Within 8 minutes, the haploid male gametocyte genome undergoes three replication cycles (1N to 8N), while maintaining an intact NE. Axonemes assemble in the cytoplasm and connect to a bipartite MTOC-containing nuclear pole and cytoplasmic basal body, producing eight flagellated gametes. The mechanisms coordinating NE remodelling, MTOC dynamics, and flagellum assembly remain poorly understood.

Here, we identify the SUN1-ALLAN complex as a novel mediator of NE remodelling and bipartite MTOC coordination during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. SUN1, a conserved NE protein, localizes to dynamic loops and focal points near nuclear spindle poles. ALLAN, a divergent Allantoicase-like protein, has a location like that of SUN1 at nuclear MTOCs. SUN1 and ALLAN form a unique complex, detected by live-cell imaging, ultrastructural expansion microscopy, and interactomics. Deletion of either SUN1 or ALLAN gene disrupts nuclear MTOC organization, leading to basal body mis-segregation, defective spindle assembly, and impaired kinetochore attachment, but axoneme formation remains intact. Ultrastructural analysis revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic MTOC miscoordination, producing aberrant flagellated gametes lacking nuclear material. Sun1 deletion also alters parasite lipid composition, underscoring its role in NE homeostasis. These defects block parasite development in the mosquito and transmission, highlighting the essential functions of this complex.

This study reveals a bipartite MTOC and a highly divergent mechanism of NE remodelling during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. The SUN1-ALLAN complex is an unusual adaptation of the LINC complex, in absence of canonical KASH-domain proteins in Plasmodium, providing new insights into the evolution of closed mitosis and highlighting potential targets for blocking malaria transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

This escape has been attributed to mutations in critical neutralizing antibody epitopes mainly in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. Here we show that this notion is incomplete. We found that several broadly neutralizing human antibodies isolated over the past years retain an almost undiminished capacity for inhibitory targeting of RBDs of recent highly immunoevasive SARS-CoV-2 strains. Likewise, human sera collected during the pre-Omicron era from persons immunized with original Wuhan-based vaccines were found to contain abundant neutralizing activity targeted against the RBDs of modern Omicron variants. However, this unexpected neutralization sensitivity was observed only when these RBDs were incorporated into a mismatched spike protein backbone, whereas the corresponding native Omicron spike proteins were highly resistant against the same panel of antibodies and human sera. We conclude that changes occurring outside of the RBD and leading to altered conformational dynamics of the spike protein have played a key part in the viral evolution enabling SARS-CoV-2 to escape from neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved cryptic RBD epitopes.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

C. elegans possesses an expanded repertoire of at least 19 AGOs functioning in an intricate gene regulatory network. Despite their crucial roles, little is known about the regulation of AGOs, and whether their expression levels, tissue specificity, and functions change in response to genetic perturbations or environmental triggers. Here, we report that PALS-22, a member of an unusually expanded protein family in C. elegans, acts as a negative regulator of antiviral RNAi involving the RIG-I homolog. The loss of pals-22 leads to enhanced silencing of transgenes and endogenous dsRNAs. We found that PALS-22 normally suppresses the expression of two AGOs, VSRA-1 and SAGO-2, which are activated by bZIP transcription factor ZIP-1. When pals-22 is eliminated, vsra-1 and sago-2 are upregulated. These AGOs in turn play key roles in defense against foreign genetic elements and intracellular pathogens, respectively. Surprisingly, while in pals-22 mutants immune genes functioning in the intracellular pathogen response (IPR) are upregulated, removing SAGO-2 or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RRF-3 in these mutants leads to the downregulation of these genes. This observation contrasts with the typical gene-silencing role of siRNAs. Finally, by analyzing C. elegans wild isolates and lab reference strains, we demonstrate that PALS-22 regulates the expression of several germline AGOs, affecting germline mortality and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In summary, PALS-22 is a key genetic node that balances the trade-off between immunity and germline health by modulating the functions of different AGOs, thereby shaping the outputs of the RNAi machinery and the dynamics of epigenetic inheritance.","NA","biorxiv",1734041401910

Unexpectedly, this long-standing reference was shown to be incomplete in 2019 by a genome assembly from the N2-derived strain VC2010. Moreover, genetically divergent versions of N2 have arisen over decades of research and hindered reproducibility of C. elegans genetics and genomics. Here we provide a 106.4 Mb gap-free, telomere-to-telomere genome assembly of C. elegans, generated from CGC1, an isogenic derivative of the N2 strain. We used improved long-read sequencing and manual assembly of 43 recalcitrant genomic regions to overcome deficiencies of prior N2 and VC2010 assemblies, and to assemble tandem repeat loci including a 772-kb sequence for the 45S rRNA genes. While many differences from earlier assemblies came from repeat regions, unique additions to the genome were also found. Of 19,972 protein-coding genes in the N2 assembly, 19,790 (99.1%) encode products that are unchanged in the CGC1 assembly.

The reliability of these forecasts hinges on detailed knowledge of disease transmission across different population segments, which may be inferred from within-community transmission rates via proxy data, such as contact surveys and mobility data. However, these approaches are indirect, making it difficult to accurately estimate rare transmissions between socially or geographically distant communities. We show that the steep ramp up of genome sequencing surveillance during the pandemic can be leveraged to directly identify transmission patterns between communities. Specifically, our approach uses a hidden Markov model to infer the fraction of infections a community imports from other communities based on how rapidly the allele frequencies in the focal community converge to those in the donor communities. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from England and the U.S., we uncover networks of inter-community disease transmission that, while broadly reflecting geographical relationships, also expose epidemiologically significant long-range interactions. We provide evidence that transmission between regions can substantially change between waves of variants of concern, both in magnitude and direction, and analyze how the inferred plasticity and heterogeneity in inter-community transmission impact evolutionary forecasts. Overall, our study high-lights population genomic time series data as a crucial record of epidemiological interactions, which can be deciphered using tree-free inference methods.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401910

Specific deletion of the Ifngr1 in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) greatly expanded the intratumoral lymphatic network and drove the emergence of a tip-like endothelial state, promoting lymph node metastasis but not dendritic cell migration.

To examine how lineage origins shape their properties, we differentiated V2a neurons from hPSC-derived progenitors with distinct anteroposterior identities. Single-nucleus multiomic analysis revealed lineage-specific transcription factor motifs and numerous differentially expressed genes related to axon growth and calcium handling. Bypassing lineage patterning via transcription factor-induced differentiation yielded neurons distinct from both developmentally relevant populations and human tissue, emphasizing the need to follow developmental steps to generate authentic cell identities.

Our high-resolution cryoEM structure reveals that PITHD1 simultaneously blocks three crucial functional sites on the 19S regulatory particle which are required for ubiquitin recognition, processing, and substrate translocation. This triple-lock mechanism effectively prevents protein degradation in dormant cells. Given PITHD1s evolutionary conservation across species, this mechanism likely represents a general strategy for reversible proteasome regulation during cellular dormancy.

Tokenvizz is a novel tool for genomic analysis that enhances data discovery and visualization by combining GraphRAG-inspired tokenization with graph-based modeling. In Tokenvizz, genomic sequences are represented as graphs, where sequence k-mers (tokens) serve as nodes and attention scores as edge weights, enabling researchers to visually interpret complex, non-linear relationships within DNA sequences. Through a web-based visualization interface, researchers can interactively explore these genomic relationships and extract biologically meaningful insights about regulatory patterns and functional elements. Applied to promoter-enhancer interaction prediction tasks, Tokenvizz outperformed traditional sequential models while providing interpretable insights into genomic features, demonstrating the advantage of graph-based representations for biological discovery.

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401910

PREVENT-19 (NCT04611802/2019nCoV-301), a pivotal phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated robust efficacy of a primary, 2-dose series of NVX-CoV2373 against COVID-19.

MethodsProtocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered [&ge;]6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.

ResultsImmune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals. These results support the utility of this vaccine platform and continued updates, based on currently circulating strains, to help effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1734041401910
