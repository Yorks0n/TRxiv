Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1747519715869

However, some lineages remain recalcitrant to assembly despite recent advances in sequencing technologies and assembly tools. Birds present a substantial genome assembly challenge due to the presence of tiny, hard to assemble microchromosomes that are often highly fragmented or even missing in draft genome assemblies. As such, bird genomes require a large amount of expert manual curation effort via manipulation of genome-wide Hi-C contact maps and many current chromosome-level bird genome assemblies do not resolve the known karyotype. Microchromosomes have distinct genetic and epigenetic features. They are GC-biased, gene-rich, highly methylated, and have distinct spatial organisation in the centre of the nucleus. Importantly, they are conserved across avian evolution. Here, using a reference set of expert curated bird genomes, we have identified a set of conserved microchromosome genes and developed MicroFinder, a pipeline that uses this gene set to find small microchromosome fragments in draft genome assemblies to act as anchors for manual curation of microchromosomes. We demonstrate how MicroFinder can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of bird genome curation. Furthermore, we highlight the usefulness of MicroFinder by carrying out MicroFinder-enabled re-curation of 12 previously released chromosome-scale bird genome assemblies, increasing the sequence content of microchromosome models.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

The use of ExM has revealed several novel insights into the nanoscale architectures of cellular protein complexes, especially the microtubule cytoskeleton in model and non-model systems. Despite tremendous progress in expansion microscopy protocols that preserve cellular ultrastructure (U-ExM), compatible probes for imaging actin isoforms with U-ExM are still lacking and have hindered the study of diverse actin isoforms and networks across model systems. Here, we use IntAct, an internally tagged actin that incorporates into cellular actin networks, to develop and optimize U-ExM of diverse actin network types in both yeast and mammalian cells. Using expression of ALFA-tagged IntAct variants in yeast and mammalian cells, we show robust visualization of actin patches, cables, and rings in yeast and diverse actin networks such as actin cortex, stress fibers, filopodia, lamellipodium in mammalian cells at improved resolution. We also detect transient nuclear actin filaments using IntAct-U-ExM underscoring the advantages offered by our approach to image understudied actin structures. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IntAct-U-ExM for performing super-resolution imaging of various actin structures in an isoform-specific manner and highlight the potential of IntAct to study the nanoscale organization of diverse actin cytoskeletal networks across species.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Consensus assembly using Trycycler can improve accuracy, but its lack of automation limits scalability. There is a need for an automated method to generate high-quality consensus bacterial genome assemblies from long-read data. Results: We present Autocycler, a command-line tool for generating accurate bacterial genome assemblies by combining multiple alternative long-read assemblies of the same genome. Without requiring user input, Autocycler builds a compacted De Bruijn graph from the input assemblies, clusters and filters contigs, trims overlaps and resolves consensus sequences by selecting the most common variant at each locus. It also supports manual curation when desired, allowing users to refine assemblies in challenging or important cases. In our evaluation using Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads from five bacterial isolates, Autocycler outperformed individual assemblers, automated pipelines and other consensus tools, producing assemblies with lower error rates and improved structural accuracy. Availability and implementation: Autocycler is implemented in Rust, open-source and freely available at github.com/rrwick/Autocycler. It runs on Linux and macOS and is extensively documented.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

However, efficient and lossless indexing of such structures remains challenging due to the scale and complexity of pangenomic data. We present a practical and scalable indexing framework based on tag arrays, which annotate positions in the Burrows--Wheeler transform (BWT) with graph coordinates. Our method extends the FM-index with a run-length compressed tag structure that enables efficient retrieval of all unique graph locations where a query pattern appears. We introduce a novel construction algorithm that combines unique k-mers, graph-based extensions, and haplotype traversal to compute the tag array in a memory-efficient manner. To support large genomes, we process each chromosome independently and then merge the results into a unified index using properties of the multi-string BWT and r-index. Our evaluation on the HPRC graphs demonstrates that the tag array structure compresses effectively, scales well with added haplotypes, and preserves accurate mapping information across diverse regions of the genome. This indexing method enables lossless and haplotype-aware querying in complex pangenomes and offers a practical indexing layer to develop scalable aligners and downstream graph-based analysis tools.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

In this retrospective review, we evaluated the landscape of clinical trials (CTx) registered on ClinicalTrials.gov for the consideration of potential factors contributing to human heterogeneity in their design and analyses. Among CTx registered from 1995-2024, we observed a trend toward equality in including female participants, but lack of reporting of sex as a biological variable. Limited demographic diversity was observed with [~]93% White population participation. There was a substantial divergence in the diagnostic criteria and a wide range of tools employed to measure CC. Lastly, few studies considered cancer type and stage as clinical variables. Overall, a substantial gap remains in our knowledge of CC in non-white and female populations. Ultimately, these underreported data across CC CTx complicate the comparison and interpretation of CTx results, both within understudied populations and in specific cancer types. The current evolution of knowledge and new methodologies used for CC assessment reinforce the need for a constant revision of the CC consensus definition and diagnosis criteria to align with current advances in our understanding of human heterogeneity in CC.","NA","medrxiv",1747519715869

While data-dependent acquisition (DDA) has been the standard for navigating through the complexity associated with non-enzymatic immunopeptide database searches, data-independent acquisition (DIA) is increasingly adopted in immunopeptidomics research. In this work, we compare diaPASEF to conventional ddaPASEF in terms of global immunopeptidome profiling and bacterial epitope discovery of the model intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We show that DIA spectrum-centric workflows that search pseudo-MS/MS spectra complement DDA analysis by uncovering additional human and bacterial immunopeptides. Furthermore, we leveraged DIA-NN for generating and searching proteome-wide predicted HLA class I peptide spectral libraries, scoring approximately 150 million immunopeptide peptide precursors. This approach outperformed other spectrum-based methods in identification of MHC class I peptides and recovered low-abundant peptide precursors missed by other methods. Taken together, our results demonstrate how both DIA spectrum- and peptide-centric immunopeptidomics analysis are promising strategies to identify low-abundant immunopeptides.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

It has been proposed that targeting {beta}-oxidation could shorten treatment duration by killing non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis within granulomas in the lungs. Here we show that Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast growing and nonpathogenic model for energy metabolism in M. tuberculosis, relies on EtfD for extracting energy from {beta}-oxidation. Electron cryomicroscopy allowed structure determination of M. smegmatis EtfD, revealing an unusual linear [3Fe-4S] cluster that has not been seen in other protein structures, but which resembles the catalytic noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters in heterodisulfide reductases. The structure suggests how EtfD transfers electrons from {beta}-oxidation to the electron transport chain.

However, how these malignant states arise and whether they follow defined cellular trajectories across tumours is poorly understood. Here, we generated a deep single cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of human glioblastoma that pairs transcriptomic, epigenomic and genomic profiling of 12 tumours across multiple regions. We identify that glioblastoma heterogeneity is driven by spatially-patterned transitions of cancer cells from developmental-like states towards those defined by a glial injury response and hypoxia. This cellular trajectory regionalises tumours into distinct tissue niches and manifests in a molecularly conserved manner across tumours as well as genetically distinct tumour subclones. Moreover, using a new deep learning framework to map cancer cell states jointly with clones in situ, we show that tumour subclones are finely spatially intermixed through glioblastoma tissue niches. Finally, we show that this cancer cell trajectory is intimately linked to myeloid heterogeneity and unfolds across regionalised myeloid signalling environments. Our findings define a stereotyped trajectory of cancer cells in glioblastoma and unify glioblastoma tumour heterogeneity into a tractable cellular and tissue framework.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

However, the evolution of the cichlid axial skeleton has been largely overlooked, despite its high variation and functional significance for locomotion. Here, we present the first macroevolutionary study of axial morphology in African cichlids, based on phylogenetic comparative analyses of 4861 individuals from 583 species. Adaptation to demersal, pelagic, and piscivorous niches has led to the evolution of elongate bodies with high vertebral counts in lacustrine cichlids, emphasising the role of the fusiform body shape in ecological adaptation. However, riverine species occupy a broader axial morphospace than lacustrine species, which is partly explained by a higher stochastic rate of vertebral count evolution in riverine lineages. In addition, the occupied axial morphospace broadly correlates with the estimated age of the lacustrine radiations, suggesting that exploration of axial morphospace is a function of divergence time. However, rates of vertebral count evolution are not the same across the lake radiations. Therefore, accumulated variation in vertebral counts (and more broadly axial morphospace) is not solely a function of divergence time. Finally, we show that the common ancestor of African cichlids possessed a distinctly riverine axial morphology, indicating that the exploration of axial morphospace radiated outward from this ancestral riverine form. These findings highlight the importance of a comparative approach to studying cichlid evolution and underscore the value of African cichlids as a model for investigating the evolutionary and developmental dynamics of the teleostean vertebral column.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Several recent studies have demonstrated performance gains from pretraining neural foundation models on multi-session datasets, seemingly overcoming this challenge. However, these studies typically lack fine-grained data scaling analyses. It remains unclear how different sources of heterogeneity influence model performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, and whether all sessions contribute equally to downstream performance gains. In this work, we systematically investigate how data heterogeneity impacts the scaling behavior of neural data transformers (NDTs) in neural activity prediction. We found that explicit sources of heterogeneity, such as brain region mismatches among sessions, reduced scaling benefits of neuron- and region-level activity prediction performances. For tasks that do exhibit consistent scaling, we identified implicit data heterogeneity arising from cross-session variability. Through our proposed session-selection procedure, models pretrained on as few as five selected sessions outperformed those pretrained on the entire dataset of 84 sessions. Our findings challenge the direct applicability of traditional scaling laws to neural data and suggest that prior claims of multi-session scaling benefits may be premature. This work both highlights the importance of incremental data scaling analyses and suggests new avenues toward optimally selecting pretraining data when developing foundation models on large-scale neuroscience datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

The resulting neutral binders can be fused to EGFP allowing antibody-free intracellular staining. Expressing neutral binders in human cells as fusions with functional domains can drive small molecule-controlled protein aggregation and trigger proteasomal degradation of endogenous target proteins in living cells.

Estimating VA typically involves measuring fitness proxies on a large number of individuals from a known pedigree. Such data are hard to collect and the results are often sensitive to the definition of fitness used. Here, we present a new method for estimating VA that does not involve making measurements of fitness proxies on individuals, but instead tracks changes in the genetic composition of the population. First, we show that VA can readily be expressed as a function of the genome-wide diversity/linkage disequilibrium matrix and genome-wide expected change in allele frequency due to selection. We then show how independent experimental replicates can be used to infer the expected change in allele frequency due to selection and then estimate VA via a linear mixed model. Finally, using individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that our approach yields precise and unbiased estimates over a range of biologically plausible levels of VA.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Their rapid evolution often obscures evolutionary relationships, making it difficult to assign functions using sequence-based methods alone. Although conservation of protein fold can reveal deep homologies undetectable by sequence comparison, viral proteins remain vastly underrepresented in structural databases, limiting our ability to explore them at the structural level. Here, we address this gap by clustering all unique viral sequences from the NCBI RefSeq database and predicting the structures of ~27,000 representative proteins using AlphaFold2, creating a large-scale viral structural resource, the Viral AlphaFold Database (VAD). We uncover ~10,000 proteins belonging to clusters that share folds across viruses infecting bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, revealing shared protein folds across diverse host-infecting viruses. We also predict oligomeric states using AlphaFold2-based homodimer modelling, alongside structural comparisons to the Protein Data Bank, providing valuable new data on the potential for viral proteins to oligomerise. We further reveal that large regions of the viral protein universe remain functionally dark and report the discovery and experimental validation of a previously uncharacterised antiviral toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. VAD is a resource that provides a foundation for exploring viral structure-function relationships, including ancient folds that shape viral interactions across all life.

Despite this, Microsporidia remain relatively enigmatic, with many aspects of their biology and evolution unexplored. Key questions include whether Microsporidia undergo sexual reproduction, and the nature of the relationship between tetraploid and diploid lineages. While few high-quality microsporidian genomes currently exist to help answer such questions, large-scale biodiversity genomics initiatives, such as the Darwin Tree of Life project, can generate high-quality genome assemblies for microsporidian parasites when sequencing infected host species. Here, we present 40 new microsporidian genome assemblies from infected arthropod hosts that were sequenced to create reference genomes. Out of the 40, 32 are complete genomes, eight of which are chromosome-level, and eight are partial microsporidian genomes. We characterised 14 of these as polyploid and five as diploid. We found that tetraploid genome haplotypes are consistent with autopolyploidy, in that they coalesce more recently than species, and that they likely recombine. Within some genomes, we found large-scale rearrangements between the homeologous genomes. We also observed a high rate of rearrangement between genomes from different microsporidian groups, and a striking tolerance for segmental duplications. Analysis of chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data indicated that tetraploid genomes are likely organised into two diploid compartments, similar to dikaryotic cells in fungi, with evidence of recombination within and between compartments. Together, our results provide evidence for the existence of a sexual cycle in Microsporidia, and suggest a model for the microsporidian lifecycle that mirrors fungal reproduction.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Small modifications to Ub such as phosphorylation, acetylation, or ADP-ribosylation have varying impacts on signaling. The Deltex family of E3 ligases was previously implicated in the ubiquitylation of ADP-ribose (ADPr) and ADPr-containing macromolecules. Our previous work found ester-linked mono-ADPr ubiquitylation (MARUbylation) on PARP7 and PARP10 in cells and that this mark is extended with K11 polyUb. We previously screened for E3 ligases that interact with PARP7 through three different approaches and identified six candidates, including the Deltex family member DTX2. One of these hits, RNF114, interacts with various other PARPs, leading us to hypothesize that RNF114 binds to sites of MARUbylation and extends K11 polyUb. Here, we show that DTX2 generates the initial MARUbe on PARP7 in cells, which depends on PARP7 catalytic activity. The MARUbe on PARP7 is extended with K11 polyUb by RNF114. To investigate the mechanism of RNF114 reader/writer function, we developed a click chemistry-inspired chemoenzymatic approach to create a novel fluorescent Ub-ADPr probe for studying its interaction with RNF114. Strikingly, we found that RNF114 has a weak affinity for ADPr and Ub separately but explicitly recognizes the linkage between Ub and ADPr present in MARUbylated species. We used AlphaFold3 modeling to examine the mechanisms of Ub-ADPr recognition and K11-linked polyUb extension by RNF114. We identified a tandem Di19-UIM module in RNF114 as a MARUbe-binding domain (MUBD), thus providing a reader function that interfaces with K11-specific writer activity. Finally, we described a small family of MUBD-containing E3 ligases that demonstrate preference for Ub-ADPr, which we call MARUbe-Targeted Ligases (MUTLs).","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

While exteroceptive stimuli, such as food and drugs of abuse, are well-established activators of DA-neuron activity, growing evidence indicates that interoceptive signals also play a critical role in modulating reward. Among these, the gut-brain vagal axis has emerged as a key pathway, yet its precise contribution to mesolimbic DA-dependent signaling, dynamics and behaviors remains poorly defined. Here, we combine complementary ex vivo and in vivo approaches across multiple scales to investigate how the gut-brain vagal axis regulates DA dynamics and reward-related behaviors. We show that gut-brain vagal tone is essential for gating mesolimbic DA system activity and functions, modulating DA-dependent molecular and cellular processes, and scaling both food- and drugs-induced reinforcement. These findings challenge the traditional brain-centric view of reward processing, supporting a more unified and integrated model in which gut-derived and vagus-mediated interoceptive signals are pivotal in intrinsically shaping motivation and reinforcement. By uncovering the influence of gut-brain vagal communication on mesolimbic DA functions, this work offers new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying both adaptive and maladaptive reward processes, with broad implications for eating disorders and addiction.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Many conventional plant protein purification methods rely on expensive reagents, multi-step procedures, and labor-intensive workflows, limiting their feasibility for many applications. Here, we present the Catch & Release system, a cost-effective, fast and reliable one-step purification workflow for the isolation of soluble and membrane-bound proteins from plant tissues. The Catch & Release toolbox includes a vector set, a homemade GFP-trap and homemade proteases. Catch & Release vectors streamline cloning and transgenic plant selection through the Fluorescence-Accumulating Seed Technology (FAST), which marks positive transformants with a strongly fluorescing seed coat. Each plasmid consists of four, easy to exchange, modules: a plant promoter, a cloning dropout marker, protease cleavage sites, and seven different epitope tags, including an innovative dual-fluorescent tag, providing flexibility for diverse experimental needs. The in vivo functionality of all modules has been confirmed. Besides enabling standard molecular biological experimentation, our vector set in combination with homemade GFP-trap and proteases enables efficient and rapid isolation of soluble and high molecular weight membrane proteins directly from plants. By following our detailed reagent preparation instructions, purification costs can be decreased hundred-fold compared to the commercially available options.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

The results reveal both known and novel degron motifs, both internal as well as at the C-terminus. Mapping the degrons onto protein structures, predicted by AlphaFold2, revealed that most of the degrons are located in buried regions, indicating that they only become active upon unfolding or misfolding.

This phenomenon is traditionally attributed to the activity of its two Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) and their associated effectors. A critical challenge for these bacteria is acquiring nutrients from inside the host cell. Thus, they modulate the metabolism of host cells to replicate. Given the metabolic plasticity of macrophages, a key unresolved question is how their metabolic heterogeneity shapes intracellular Salmonella replication. By using human primary macrophages and live-cell imaging to monitor bacterial dynamics at the single-cell level, we revealed that Salmonella does not replicate in all infected cells. However, supplementation with specific carbon sources used by Salmonella during infection accelerated bacterial replication and increased the proportion of macrophages showing replicative bacteria. Remarkably, this occurred even in the absence of functional T3SSs, as a {Delta}prgH/ssaV double mutant was able to replicate in a subset of infected cells under favorable nutrient conditions. These phenotypes are further amplified in macrophages with higher glycolytic activity, such as the murine RAW 264.7 cell line. Further analyses demonstrated that enhanced Salmonella replication is not strictly dependent on host glycolytic activity but is instead driven by the ability of the host cell to take up the nutrients Salmonella prefers for its replication early during infection. In summary, our findings suggest that the dependence of Salmonella on its T3SSs for intracellular replication can be bypassed when host cells provide optimal access to key nutrients and highlight the impact of metabolic heterogeneity in shaping intracellular bacterial replication during infection of macrophages.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

We demonstrate how this can be improved upon by applying the marginalized between-within framework. Study Design and Setting: We provide an overview of sibling comparison methods and the marginalized between-within framework, which enables estimation of absolute risks and clinically relevant metrics while accounting for shared familial confounding. We illustrate the approach using Swedish registry data to examine the association between maternal smoking and infant mortality, estimating absolute risk differences, average treatment effects, attributable fractions, and numbers needed to harm (or treat). Results: The marginalized between-within model decomposes effects into within- and between-family components while applying a global baseline across all families. Although it typically yields similar relative estimates to conditional logistic or stratified Cox regression, the model's specification of a baseline enables the estimation of absolute measures. In the applied example, absolute measures provided more interpretable and policy-relevant insights than relative estimates alone. Code for implementation in Stata and R is provided. Conclusion: The marginalized between-within framework may strengthen the interpretability of family-based analysis by enabling absolute and policy-relevant estimates for both binary and time-to-event outcomes, moving beyond the limitations of solely relying on relative effect measures.","NA","medrxiv",1747519715869

Here, we describe a cell microfactory platform based on the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii for the production of nanobody biologics in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. High-level secretion of nanobodies by S. boulardii was achieved by optimizing promoters, secretion signals, and antibody formats. In mice, oral gavage of S. boulardii allowed efficient and transient colonization of the colonic compartment and in situ production of a therapeutic nanobody directed against tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In a mouse model of chemical-induced colitis, GI-delivery of anti-mTNF nanobody via live S. boulardii improved both survival and disease severity without causing overt perturbation of microbiome composition. These results position S. boulardii as a synthetic biotic platform for the in situ production and delivery of protein-based therapeutics to the GI tract.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Using genetic and functional assays, we demonstrate that PI3K{delta} deficiency in DCs leads to broad dysregulation of intestinal CD4 T-cell immunity, characterized by impaired regulatory T-cell expansion and increased susceptibility to colitis.

However, despite its widespread utility, omics data for O. latipes are dispersed across various public databases and lack a centralized platform.

MedakaBase also provides genome-wide browsing of diverse datasets, including tissue-specific transcriptomes and intraspecific genomic variations, integrated with gene models from different sources. Additionally, the platform offers gene models optimized for single-cell transcriptome analysis, which often requires coverage of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of transcripts.

How durations are stored in working memory is unknown, despite the widely held view of memory systems central role in timing. Here, we investigated the neural signatures of a sequence of durations (n-item sequence) held in working memory. We recorded human participants using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they performed an n-item delayed reproduction task, which required to encode a sequence of durations, maintain it, and then reproduce it. The number of items in a sequence (one or three) and the duration of the sequence were orthogonalized. Our results show that during working memory maintenance, the number of durations, not the duration of the sequence, affected recall precision and could be decoded from alpha and beta oscillatory activity. Parieto-occipital alpha power showed a direct link with the precision of temporal reproduction. Our results extend earlier behavioral findings suggesting that durations are itemized in working memory and that their number, not their duration, modulates recall precision (Herbst et al., 2025). Crucially, we establish that alpha power reflects a universal signature of working memory load and mediates recall precision, even for abstract information such as duration.

While there are compelling reasons to expect polygenic adaptation to be common, direct evidence for it is still lacking. In turn, there are hundreds of examples of large effect adaptations across species, but it is unclear whether they are a common occurrence in any given species. Synthesizing the different lines of evidence is further complicated by differences in study designs, limitations and biases. Here, we reframe this long-standing question in terms of the trait under selection and ask how the genetic basis of adaptation is expected to depend on key properties of the genetic variation in the trait (i.e., the trait genetics) and on the changes in selection pressures that act on it (i.e., the ""trait ecology""). To study this question, we consider a quantitative trait subject to stabilizing selection and model the response to selection when a population at mutation-selection-drift balance experiences a sudden shift in the optimal value. Using this model, we delimit how the contributions of large effect and polygenic changes to adaptation depend on the genetics and ecology of the trait, as well as other salient factors. This theory allows us to formulate testable predictions about when different modes of adaptation are expected and to outline a framework within which to interpret disparate sources of evidence about the genetic basis of adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Single-molecule footprinting (SMF) and long-read chromatin accessibility assays such as Fiber-seq now capture these interactions at nucleotide resolution on individual DNA molecules. However, existing computational tools remain insufficient to decode complex binding events from sparse methylation data. Here, we introduce HiddenFoot, a probabilistic modeling framework based on statistical mechanics that quantitatively infers TF, nucleosome, and Pol II occupancy profiles on single DNA molecules by systematically evaluating all thermodynamically plausible binding configurations. Applying HiddenFoot to SMF and Fiber-seq data from mouse, Drosophila, and human cells, we recovered known TF footprints, precisely resolved Pol II pausing, and identified extensive heterogeneity in nucleosome positioning driven by TF binding. HiddenFoot further distinguishes direct TF--TF cooperativity from nucleosome-mediated co-dependency by estimating pairwise interaction energies and comparing to null models under equilibrium. By integrating biophysical modeling with high-resolution single-molecule data, HiddenFoot offers a general, interpretable framework for dissecting regulatory logic in native chromatin with base-pair precision.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

These various growth conditions allow C. pacifica to outcompete any invading contaminants in open-air environments.

This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis, in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine/methionine) or inorganic sulfate, robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acid as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a C. albicans mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase (Pfk1) exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Overall, our research elucidates a previously uncharacterized coupling between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism that is critical for driving fungal morphogenesis, contributing to our understanding of this conserved phenomenon.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

The levels of both proteins were significantly elevated and collagen I fibers were significantly thicker in HGSOC metastases. Moreover, the ECM cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) was increased in omental metastases, where it is enzymatically active in the extracellular environment. This information was used to develop ECM constructs recapitulating these key changes, alone and in combination, to investigate their impact on HGSOC cell adhesion. To our knowledge, this is the first report using TG2 as a cross-linking agent to generate constructs from multiple ECM components. Low levels of HGSOC cell adhesion were observed on colIagen-only (coll) gels, while inclusion of cFN or plasma fibronection (pFN) increased cell adhesion. TG2-mediated cross-linking of colI/cFN hydrogels promoted HGSOC cell adhesion, while cross-linking of coll/pFN had no effect. Cell adhesion was dependent on ligand identity and fiber diameter. When fiber thickness was held constant, the inclusion of cFN led to greater HGSOC cell adhesion relative to pFN or coll, due to interactions of {beta}1 integrins with the EDA and RGD domains of cFN. Meanwhile, when gel composition was held constant, HGSOC cell adhesion increased as fiber thickness was increased through modifications to gelation temperature. Combined, our results demonstrate how ECM changes associated with omental metastasis can support tumor progression and provide insights into methods to tailor biomaterials to support cell adhesion.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Like humans, prairie voles are among the few mammalian species that form selective social bonds with both peers and mates, making them an excellent model for the mechanistic investigation of selective social attachment. Here, we explored the role of oxytocin receptors in selective peer attachment using prairie voles lacking a functional oxytocin receptor gene (Oxtr1-/-). We found that Oxtr1-/- animals exhibited significant delays in peer relationship formation compared to wildtype animals. Oxytocin receptor function also contributed to the maintenance of peer bonds, as Oxtr1-/- voles displayed reduced relationship stability and lost selective attachments rapidly in a multi-chamber, group-living habitat. Oxtr1-/- voles also showed deficits in both general social reward as well as selective social reward for a peer partner over an unfamiliar conspecific. Evoked oxytocin release in the nucleus accumbens was reduced in Oxtr1-/- animals compared to their wildtype counterparts, indicating that these voles do not have a compensatory increase in oxytocinergic signaling. Together, these data indicate that oxytocin receptors influence the formation, persistence, and reward value of peer relationships.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Little is understood about the regulatory mechanisms of replication stress recovery, including the mechanisms involved in the restart of stalled replication forks. Here, we identify the oncogenic phosphatase PPM1D/WIP1 as a critical regulator of replication fork restart. Upon recovery from replication stress, PPM1D prevents excessive MRE11- and DNA2-dependent nucleolytic degradation of stalled forks. Loss of PPM1D function leads to defects in RAD51 recruitment to chromatin and impairs RAD51-dependent fork restart. Phosphoproteomic analysis reveals that PPM1D regulates a network of ATM substrates, several of which are phosphorylated at an S/T-Q-(E/D)n motif. Strikingly, inhibition of ATM suppresses the deleterious consequences of impaired PPM1D function at replication forks, enabling timely fork restart. The dominant effect of ATM hyper-signaling in suppressing fork restart occurs, in part, through the excessive engagement of 53BP1 and consequent RAD51 antagonization. These findings uncover a new mode of ATM signaling responding to fork stalling and highlights the need for PPM1D to restrain ATM signaling and enable proper fork restart.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Here, we apply energetic profiling to structural time series from cryo-EM datasets of IAPP, tau, and -synuclein to decode the principles governing fibril maturation, stability and polymorphic divergence. By mapping residue-level free energy contributions across experimentally resolved assembly pathways, we reconstruct the complex maturation trajectories of distinct amyloid systems. We find that amyloid assembly is driven by aggregation-prone regions that act as sequence-encoded stabilizing motifs. As assembly progresses, these motifs are reorganized and expanded, while additional regions introduce structural frustration that enables conformational flexibility. In several cases, environmental cofactors such as metal ions or polyanions are observed in association with regions of structural remodeling, where they may act to compensate for otherwise energetically strained conformations. Notably, structurally distinct polymorphs can exhibit similar energetic profiles, while polymorphs with similar folds may differ thermodynamically depending on their assembly environment. This framework connects polymorph structure to both encoded sequence features and extrinsic modifiers, offering mechanistic insight into how amyloid strains mature and diversify over time.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Mechanistically, we show that the transition to naive pluripotency is accompanied by a distinctive alternative splicing program indicative of reduced RNAPII elongation, both in vitro and in vivo. These findings redefine the functional relationship between replication and transcription dynamics and uncover transcriptional velocity as a tunable layer of control over cellular identity transitions.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

An obstacle to the development of new T cell receptor therapeutics is the difficulty in engineering these proteins for enhanced therapeutic efficacy while avoiding introduction of unexpected off-target autoreactivity. In this study, we apply a functional high-throughput screening assay, Tope-seq, to detecting cross-reactive epitopes in libraries of >5 x 105 unique peptide-coding sequences. We retrospectively analyze an affinity-enhanced engineered T cell receptor, which previously failed clinical trials due to severe off-target toxicity caused by epitope cross-reactivity, by comprehensive functional testing against all genome-coded self-antigens. Using the Tope-seq methodology, we were able to identify the epitope mediating off-target reactivity at a significance threshold of p < 0.01 in first-pass bulk screening. We also identified other potential cross-reactive epitopes of the engineered TCR of-interest, suggesting that the need for assessing promiscuity in TCR based therapeutics is larger than previously appreciated.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Phosphorylations of Histone H3 Thr3 and Histone H2A Thr120 and modification-independent nucleosome interactions involving Survivin and Borealin contribute to CPC centromere enrichment. However, mechanistic basis for how various nucleosome binding elements collectively contribute to CPC centromere enrichment and whether CPC has any non-catalytic role at centromere remain open questions. Combining a high-resolution cryoEM structure of CPC-bound H3Thr3ph nucleosome with atomic force microscopy and biochemical and cellular assays, we demonstrate that CPC employs multipartite interactions involving both static and dynamic interactions, which facilitate its engagement at nucleosome acidic patch and DNA entry-exit site. Perturbing the CPC-nucleosome interaction compromises protection against MNase digestion in vitro, as well as the dynamic centromere association of CPC and centromeric chromatin stability in cells.

We previously reported eTAM-seq, which supports transcriptome-wide quantification of m6A by enzyme-assisted adenosine deamination. While effective, TadA8.20--the enzyme used in our first-generation technology--is sensitive not only to m6A but also to RNA structure, making accurate detection dependent on the inclusion of control transcriptomes. Here, we introduce eTAM-seq-v2, in which we replace TadA8.20 with TadA8r, a further evolved adenosine deaminase with superior catalytic efficiency. eTAM-seq-v2 supports control-free m6A calling with high fidelity. Because enzyme treatment preserves RNA integrity, eTAM-seq surveys >51% of A sites in all expressed genes with moderate sequencing depth (60 million uniquely mapped reads) and delivers robust performance with as little as 10 ng of total RNA (~500 cells). With eTAM-seq-v2, we delineate the m6A landscape across six human cell lines and seven embryonic mouse tissues. While uncovering broadly conserved m6A patterns, we reveal that most neighboring m6A sites are independently deposited at the single-molecule level. Moving forward, we envision that eTAM-seq-v2 will enable researchers to survey m6A in diverse biological contexts and uncover new insights into its regulatory roles.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in limiting pathogen entry and colonization. Despite intensive research into the regulation and biochemical properties of AMPs, their exact significance in vivo has remained uncertain due to the challenges of mutating small genes. Fortunately, recent technologies have enabled the mutation of individual AMP genes, overcome previous obstacles, and opened new avenues for research. In this study, we characterized one novel host-defense peptide, Paillotin (IM18, CG33706), using loss-of-function mutants. Paillotin is an ancient host defense peptide of Diptera, regulated by the Imd pathway. Loss of Paillotin does not impact the activity of either the Imd or Toll pathways. Importantly, we found that Paillotin mutants are viable but exhibit increased susceptibility to specific infections, particularly Providencia burhodogranariea. Paillotin was further found to contribute synergistically to defense against P. burhodogranariea when combined with other AMPs. However, we did not detect direct microbicidal activity of Paillotin in vitro in our hands. Taken together, our findings identify Paillotin as a novel host defense peptide acting downstream of Imd signaling, advancing our understanding of the Drosophila antimicrobial response.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Their physiological state is dynamic and impacted by abiotic and biotic conditions, responding to environmental fluctuations by changes in cellular metabolism, according to their genetic potential. Molecular, cellular and genomic approaches can identify and measure microbial responses and adaptation to environmental changes in native communities. However, isolating individual microbial cells that respond to specific changes for cultivation has been difficult. To address this, we developed a novel bacterial isolation approach (BONCAT-Live) by integrating bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) in diverse native communities, with isolation and cultivation of cells responding to specific stimuli, at different time scales. In frozen Arctic permafrost samples, we identified and isolated dormant bacteria that become active after thawing under native or nutrient enriched conditions. From a Populus tree rhizosphere, we isolated strains that thrive under high concentrations of root exudates that act as defense compounds and nutrients. In a human microbiome, we identified and isolated bacteria that rapidly proliferated when exposed to metabolites provided by the host or other co-occurring microbes. Further characterization of isolated bacterial strains will provide opportunities for in depth determination of how these microbes adapt to changes in their environments, individually and as part of model communities.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Traditionally, GABAergic input was considered as the gatekeeper, thus, receptors closest to the soma were ideally placed to veto excitation. However, recently modeling has advanced several counter-intuitive hypotheses. Since laser uncaging can be directed at will to any position, we used photostimulation to show that inhibition near the sealed end of dendrites distal to excitation is more effective than inhibition near the soma in modulating excitation. Further, dendritic inhibition was found to be branch specific. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibitory input from multiple thin basal dendrites can centripetally elevate to effectively tune distant excitation at the soma. These findings provide direct experimental evidence supporting theoretical predictions based on dendritic cable properties, revealing the critical role of dendritic geometry in shaping the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Recently, Wittmann et al. described an in silico pipeline of generative AI tools to demonstrate how amino acid sequences encoding sequences of concern (SOCs) could be reformulated as synthetic homologs that may evade detection by biosecurity screening software (BSS) used by nucleic acid synthesis providers. While the discovered vulnerability has been mitigated, its true severity remains unclear, as the study was performed without experimental testing of the synthetic homologs. Here, we present a testing, evaluation, validation, and verification (TEVV) framework for AI-assisted protein design (AIPD), using safe proteins as SOC proxies. Our findings indicate AIPD can generate synthetic homologs whose predicted structures are similar to a native template, but without necessarily retaining activity. We determine that current AIPD systems are not yet powerful enough to reliably rewrite the sequence of a given protein, while both maintaining activity and evading detection by BSS. We further conclude that TEVV of generated sequences requires significant investment of time, technical skill, and resources. We offer our framework and test proteins as a general benchmark of AIPD capability.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

Here, we used fiber photometry to investigate how in vivo BLA dopamine signaling tracks learning. We show that reward cues evoke BLA dopamine signals that diminish, rather than grow, with training. As the complexity of the learning context was increased, where rats actively differentiated between various cue types signaling threat, reward, safety, and neutral associations, the magnitude of cue-evoked BLA dopamine responses was largest early in training and reported the level of perceived emotional saliency. Fear and safety cues prompted larger, sustained dopamine signals compared to reward and neutral cues, an effect that was more apparent in female rats, compared to males. Together, our findings broaden the theoretical landscape of dopamine heterogeneity, showing that BLA dopamine supports dynamic disambiguation of relative stimulus importance by non-associatively encoding sensory state transitions, independent of value.

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.

Efficient methods are needed to infer structural similarity within these datasets. We present an end-to-end alignment method, called SoftAlign, which takes as input the 3D coordinates of a protein pair and outputs a structural alignment. In addition to the traditional Smith-Waterman alignment method, we introduce a modified softmax alignment that shows very promising results for structure similarity detection. We demonstrate that the SoftAlign model is able to recapitulate TM-align alignments while running faster, and it is more accurate than Foldseek on alignment and classification tasks. Although SoftAlign is not the fastest method available, it is highly precise and can be used effectively with other prefilters. In addition to developing an end-to-end structural aligner, our main contribution is the introduction and analysis of a pseudo-alignment method based on softmax, which can be used with other architectures, even those not based on structural information.

In the present study, we performed in vitro RNAPII transcription assays with the H3-H4 octasome and found that RNAPII transcribed the H3-H4 octasome more efficiently than the nucleosome. RNAPII paused at only one position, superhelical location (SHL) -4 in the H3-H4 octasome, in contrast to pausing at the SHL(-5), SHL(-2), and SHL(-1) positions in the nucleosome. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed that two H3-H4 tetramer disks are retained when the RNAPII paused at the SHL(-4) position of the H3-H4 octasome. However, when RNAPII reached the SHL(-0.5) position, five base pairs before the dyad position of the H3-H4 octasome, the proximal H3-H4 tetramer was disassembled but the distal H3-H4 tetramer still remained on the DNA. Therefore, RNAPII efficiently transcribes the H3-H4 octasome by stepwise H3-H4 tetramer disassembly.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs), a large family of transcription factors specialized in TE recognition, are known repressors of TE-derived regulatory activity through TRIM28-mediated H3K9me3 deposition. Here, we expand this paradigm by uncovering noncanonical relationships between TEs and KZFPs. By generating a comprehensive epigenomic map of KZFP-bound TEs, we find that the regulatory activity of ancient mammalian L2/MIR elements is broadly delineated by KZFP binding patterns, despite low H3K9me3 enrichment. We further dissect this relationship by investigating the function of ZNF436, a non-canonical KZFP, highly expressed during in vivo human fetal heart development. Using loss-of-function approaches, we show that ZNF436 preserves cardiomyocyte function by promoting cardiac gene expression while restricting the activation of alternative lineage programs. Mechanistically, ZNF436 recruits specialized SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes to limit the accessibility of L2/MIR-derived enhancers, many of which are active in non-cardiac tissues. These findings reveal a noncanonical, TRIM28-independent role for KZFPs in shaping cell-type-specific regulatory landscapes and emphasize the importance of repressing alternative regulatory programs alongside activating lineage-specific ones to safeguard cell identity.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

However, a comprehensive catalog of how the population of individual cell types change with age and the associated epigenomic dynamics is lacking. Here, we constructed a single-cell chromatin accessibility atlas consisting of ~7 million cells from 21 tissue types spanning three age groups in both sexes. This dataset revealed 536 main cell types and 1,828 finer-grained subtypes, defined by unique chromatin accessibility landscapes at ~1.3 million cis-regulatory elements. We observed widespread remodeling of immune lineages, with increases in plasma cells and macrophages, and depletion of T and B cell progenitors. Additionally, non-immune cell populations, including kidney podocytes, ovary granulosa cells, muscle tenocytes and lung aerocytes, showed marked reductions with age. Meanwhile, many subtypes changed synchronously across multiple organs, underscoring the potential influence of systemic inflammatory signals or hormonal cues. At the molecular level, aging was marked by thousands of differentially accessible regions, with the most concordant changes shared across cell types linked to genes related to inflammation or development. Putative upstream factors, such as intrinsic shifts in transcription factor usages and extrinsic cytokine signatures, were identified. Notably, around 40% of aging-associated main cell types and subtypes showed sex-dependent differences, with tens of thousands of chromatin accessibility peaks altered exclusively in one sex. Together, these findings present a comprehensive framework of how aging reshapes the chromatin landscape and cellular composition across diverse tissues, offering a comprehensive resource for understanding the molecular and cellular programs underlying aging and supporting the exploration of targeted therapeutic strategies to address age-related dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1747519715869

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1747519715869

Sex and gender mandates were introduced in grant competitions to increase womens health research. This study aimed to understand what type of womens health research is being funded and prioritized in open grant competitions in Canada.

MethodsPublicly available funded Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) project grant abstracts from 2020 and 2023 were coded for the mention of sex, gender, two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer plus (2S/LGBTQ+), and female-specific research and assessed for changes in research representation and funding. A deeper analysis of funded female-specific grant abstracts from 2023 and 2009-2020 was conducted to assess if grant abstracts focused on the 11 areas of global disease burden and death that disproportionately affect females, and if this has evolved over time.

ResultsThe percentage of abstracts mentioning sex, gender and 2S/LGBTQ+ doubled or quadrupled from 2020 to 2023, but remained at under 10% of overall funded abstracts. In contrast, female-specific research representation did not change over time, and remained at [~]7% of all research. Importantly, female-specific research largely focused on cancers (breast, gynecologic) or pregnancy. We also examined research funding representation for the top 11 global burden of disease or death for females across the 13 years and observed that cancer accounted for 2.07% of funding, whereas the other top 10 collectively accounted for 2.21% across 13 years.

ConclusionsDespite mandates for integrated sex and gender based analyses in Canada, research acknowledging which population is explored remains under 10%. Mandates are not affecting the percentage of funding for womens health grants. More efforts and support beyond sex and gender mandates are needed to increase funding for and to diversify female-specific research beyond pregnancy and cancer. Research devoted to womens health factors is key to achieving personalized medicine and improved health outcomes for everyone.","NA","medrxiv",1747519715869
