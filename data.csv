We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1717625229936

In October 2023, following outbreaks in sea lions in Argentina, we recorded unprecedented mass mortality ([~]17,000 individuals) in southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) at Peninsula Valdes. Seal pups were disproportionately affected. Adult seals departed early, disrupting social and breeding structure. Frequent interactions with sea lions and scavenging by seagulls were observed. Deaths of terns concurred with seals but peaked weeks later. HPAI H5N1 was confirmed in seals and terns. Moreover, genomic characterization showed viruses from pinnipeds and terns in Argentina form a distinct clade with marine mammal viruses from Peru, Chile and Brazil. These mammal-clade viruses share an identical set of mammalian adaptation mutations which are notably also found in the terns. Our combined ecological and phylogenetic data support mammal-to-mammal transmission and occasional mammal-to-bird spillover. To our knowledge, this is the first multinational transmission of H5N1 viruses in mammals ever observed globally. The implication that H5N1 viruses are becoming more evolutionary flexible and adapting to mammals in new ways could have global consequences for wildlife, humans, and/or livestock.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

It has been hypothesized that autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of Long COVID and other syndromes, such as fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by passively transferring total IgG from Long COVID patients to mice. Using Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and type-I interferon expression, we stratified patients into three Long COVID subgroups, each with unique plasma proteome signatures. Remarkably, IgG transfer from the two subgroups, which are characterized by higher plasma levels of neuronal proteins and leukocyte activation markers, induced pronounced and persistent sensory hypersensitivity with distinct kinetics. Conversely, IgG transfer from the third subgroup, which are characterized by enriched skeletal and cardiac muscle proteome profiles, reduced locomotor activity in mice without affecting their motor coordination. These findings demonstrate that transfer of IgG from Long COVID patients to mice replicates disease symptoms, underscoring IgGs causative role in Long COVID pathogenesis. This work proposes a murine model that mirrors Long COVIDs pathophysiological mechanisms, which may be used as a tool for screening and developing targeted therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Extended from clinical applications in human oncology, here we report on a novel 3D genomics approach to identify systemic blood biomarkers for canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), T-zone lymphoma (TZL), hemangiosarcoma (HSA), histiocytic sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and canine malignant melanoma, in a single assay format that encompasses multiple classes and phenotypes of cancer. In the validation of the independent test cohort the 3D whole-genome profiling in peripheral blood demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for lymphomas and sarcomas as a class, with accuracy >80%; and high sensitivity and specificity for individual indications, with accuracy >89%. This study demonstrates a 3D genomic approach can be used to develop a non-invasive, blood-based test for multiple choice diagnosis of canine oncological indications. The modular EpiSwitch(R) Specific Canine Blood (EpiSwitch SCB) test promises to help veterinary specialists to diagnose the disease, make more informed treatment decisions, better utilize alternative effective treatments, minimize or avoid unnecessarily toxicity, and efficiently manage costs and resources.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Here, we report chronic neurological dysfunction in mice infected with a virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 that does not infect the brain. Long after recovery from nasal infection, we observed loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in olfactory bulb glomeruli and neurotransmitter levels in the substantia nigra (SN) persisted. Vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in these brain areas was accompanied by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and neurobehavioral changes. RNAseq analysis unveiled persistent microglia activation, as found in human neurodegenerative diseases. Early treatment with antivirals (nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir) reduced virus titers and lung inflammation but failed to prevent neurological abnormalities, as observed in patients. Together these results show that chronic deficiencies in neuronal function in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice are not directly linked to ongoing olfactory epithelium dysfunction. Rather, they bear similarity with neurodegenerative disease, the vulnerability of which is exacerbated by chronic inflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Given the recent detection of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle and H5N1 RNA detections in pasteurized retail milk in the United States, we established the Pan-Canadian Milk (PCM) Network. Through our network of collaborators from across Canada, retail milk is being procured longitudinally and sent to a central laboratory for testing for the presence of influenza A virus RNA. To date (24 May 2024), we have tested 18 retail milk samples from five Canadian provinces (NL, NB, QC, MB, and AB) and all have tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. Testing is ongoing and these results will be updated on rolling basis as additional data becomes available. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. Routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale will allow for monitoring of infected dairy cattle on an ongoing basis in a cost-effective, standardized, scalable and easily accessible manner. Our network and testing will act as an early warning system which will enable rapid responses necessary to contain an outbreak should any samples test positive.","NA","medrxiv",1717625229936

We present a protein sequencing method based on the ""reverse translation"" of peptide sequence information into DNA barcodes that document the identity, position, and the originating peptide of each amino acid. We employ a modified Edman degradation process that converts peptides into DNA-barcoded amino acids, which are subsequently detected by proximity extension assay, yielding multi-barcoded DNA outputs that can be PCR amplified and sequenced. Using our method, we sequenced multiple consecutive amino acids within a model peptide. This method also enables the differentiation of single amino acid substitutions, and the identification of post-translational modifications and their positions within multiple peptides simultaneously. With further development, we anticipate that this method will enable highly parallel de novo protein sequencing with single-molecule sensitivity.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.

While the influence of life history traits on invasive success is well-established, the role of behavior in the invasive potential of animals is less studied. The common coqui frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui, is a highly successful invader in Hawaii. We build on previous research characterizing changes in physiology and morphology to explore behavioral variation across the invasive range of coqui in Hawaii. We hypothesized that behavioral traits contributing to invasion expansion would be reflected in behavioral differences at the invasive center versus invasive edge. To investigate whether differences in the field represent local adaptation or behavioral plasticity, we additionally evaluated behavior following acclimation to a shared laboratory environment. While we identified only subtle behavioral variation among populations in the field, we found that individuals from all populations became less bold, active, and exploratory in the laboratory, converging on a similar behavioral phenotype. Alongside previous work, our results suggest that coqui adjust their behavior to local environmental conditions across their invasive range, and that behavioral flexibility may contribute to invasive success.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this immune strategy by instead leveraging DNA synthesis, but the identities and functions of their DNA products remain largely unknown. Here we show that DRT2 systems execute an unprecedented immunity mechanism that involves de novo gene synthesis via rolling-circle reverse transcription of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Unbiased profiling of RT-associated RNA and DNA ligands in DRT2-expressing cells revealed that reverse transcription generates concatenated cDNA repeats through programmed template jumping on the ncRNA. The presence of phage then triggers second-strand cDNA synthesis, leading to the production of long double-stranded DNA. Remarkably, this DNA product is efficiently transcribed, generating messenger RNAs that encode a stop codon-less, never-ending ORF (neo) whose translation causes potent growth arrest. Phylogenetic analyses and screening of diverse DRT2 homologs further revealed broad conservation of rolling-circle reverse transcription and Neo protein function.

Using transcriptomics analysis, we show that during their two-day period of growth deceleration, wing imaginal discs of Drosophila undergo a progressive metabolic shift away from oxidative phosphorylation and towards glycolysis. We then develop an ultra-sensitive reporter HIF-1 activity, which reveals that imaginal discs become increasingly hypoxic during development in normoxic conditions, suggesting that limiting oxygen supply could underlie growth deceleration. Growth is energetically expensive and thus expected to contribute, indirectly, to oxygen consumption. Indeed, excess TOR signalling, a key stimulator of growth, triggers hypoxia locally and systemically, highlighting the need to rein in growth when oxygen becomes limiting. This is achieved by a negative feedback loop whereby the classic TOR-inhibitory function of HIF-1 is deployed in response to developmental hypoxia. The absence of Sima/HIF-1 leads to cellular stress, which is alleviated by reduced TOR signalling. Conversely, a small increase in oxygen supply reduces the stress induced by excess TOR activity. We conclude that mild hypoxia is a normal feature of organ development and that Sima/HIF-1 prevents growth-induced oxygen demand from exceeding supply.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Employing s-long molecular dynamics simulations powered by high-performance cloud-computing and unsupervised density-driven adaptive sampling, we investigated the differences in bulk-solvent-glycan and protein-solvent-glycan interfaces between these states. We unraveled a sophisticated solvent-glycan polarization interaction network involving the N165/N343 residues that provide structural support for the open state and identified key water molecules that could potentially be targeted to destabilize this configuration. In the closed state, the reduced solvent polarization diminishes the overall N165/N343 dipoles, yet internal interactions and a reorganized sugar coat stabilize this state. Despite variations, our glycan-solvent accessibility analysis reveals the glycan shield capability to conserve constant interactions with the solvent, effectively camouflaging the virus from immune detection in both states. The presented insights advance our comprehension of viral pathogenesis at an atomic level, offering potential to combat COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Direct targeting of MYC itself remains an unmet clinical need, therefore focusing on vulnerabilities driven by MYC may be a viable option for novel therapeutic interventions. Using whole-genome CRISPR screening, we identified the de novo pyrimidine synthesis enzyme CTP synthase (CTPS1) as a strong dependency in MYC-driven MB. CTPS1 is the final and rate-limiting step in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. Targeted inhibition of CTPS1 leads to decreased tumor cell proliferation and markedly reduces MYC expression in G3 MB models. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that single agent CTPS1 inhibition activates the replication stress signaling pathway mediated by ATM-CHK2 and ATR-CHK1. Blockade of CHK1 kinase activity increases sensitivity to CTPS1 inhibition and significantly impedes heterotopic MB tumor growth. CTPS1 enzymatic activity requires the amino acid glutamine, therefore we inhibited CTPS1 using the glutamine antagonists, JHU083 and JHU395. These compounds are prodrugs of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) which were developed to exhibit exquisite blood-brain barrier penetrability. Combining JHU083 and CHK1 inhibition demonstrates potent synergy against patient-derived MB xenografts in vivo.

Multispectral fluorescent imaging of landmark organelles requires labor-intensive labeling, limits throughput, and compromises cell health. Virtual staining of label-free images with deep neural networks is an emerging solution for this problem. Multiplexed imaging of cellular landmarks from scattered light and subsequent demultiplexing with virtual staining saves the light spectrum for imaging additional molecular reporters, photomanipulation, or other tasks. Published approaches for virtual staining of landmark organelles are fragile in the presence of nuisance variations in imaging, culture conditions, and cell types. This paper reports model training protocols for virtual staining of nuclei and membranes robust to cell types, cell states, and imaging parameters. We developed a flexible and scalable convolutional architecture, named UNeXt2, for supervised training and self-supervised pre-training. The strategies we report here enable robust virtual staining of nuclei and cell membranes in multiple cell types, including neuromasts of zebrafish, across a range of imaging conditions. We assess the models by comparing the intensity, segmentations, and application-specific measurements obtained from virtually stained and experimentally stained nuclei and membranes. The models rescue the missing label, non-uniform expression of labels, and photobleaching. We share three pre-trained models, named VSCyto3D, VSCyto2D, and VSNeuromast, as well as VisCy, a PyTorch-based pipeline for training, inference, and deployment that leverages the modern OME-Zarr format.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

By adopting inducible bacterial and plant degrons we also highlight how orthogonality and uncoupling of synthetic construct degradation from the native machinery can be achieved. We show the effect of this competition to be dependent on the context of the degrons where C-terminal degradation appears to impact competition the most across our tested settings. We then build a genomically integrated capacity monitor tagged with different degrons and confirm resource competition between genomic and transiently expressed DNA constructs. This work expands the characterisation of resource competition in engineered mammalian cells to degradation also including integrated systems, providing a framework for the optimisation of heterologous expression systems to advance applications in fundamental and applied biological research.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Each software tool for searching such data uses its own internally implemented methodology for reporting and controlling the error. Many of these software tools are closed source, with incompletely documented methodology, and the strategies for validating the error are inconsistent across tools. In this work, we identify three different methods for validating false discovery rate (FDR) control in use in the field, one of which is invalid, one of which can only provide a lower bound rather than an upper bound, and one of which is valid but under-powered. The result is that the field has a very poor understanding of how well we are doing with respect to FDR control, particularly for the analysis of data-independent acquisition (DIA) data. We therefore propose a new, more powerful method for evaluating FDR control in this setting, and we then employ that method, along with an existing lower bounding technique, to characterize a variety of popular search tools. We find that the search tools for analysis of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) data generally seem to control the FDR at the peptide level, whereas none of the DIA search tools consistently controls the FDR at the peptide level across all the datasets we investigated. Furthermore, this problem becomes much worse when the latter tools are evaluated at the protein level. These results may have significant implications for various downstream analyses, since proper FDR control has the potential to reduce noise in discovery lists and thereby boost statistical power.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Here, we report a robust accumulation of misfolded proteins within the mitochondria of human pancreatic islets in T2D and elucidate its impact on {beta} cell viability. Surprisingly, quantitative proteomics studies of protein aggregates reveal that human islets from donors with T2D have a signature more closely resembling mitochondrial rather than ER protein misfolding. The matrix protease LonP1 and its chaperone partner mtHSP70 were among the proteins enriched in protein aggregates. Deletion of LONP1 in mice yields mitochondrial protein misfolding and reduced respiratory function, ultimately leading to {beta} cell apoptosis and hyperglycemia. Intriguingly, LONP1 gain of function ameliorates mitochondrial protein misfolding and restores human {beta} cell survival following glucolipotoxicity via a protease-independent effect requiring LONP1-mtHSP70 chaperone activity. Thus, LONP1 promotes {beta} cell survival and prevents hyperglycemia by facilitating mitochondrial protein folding. These observations may open novel insights into the nature of impaired proteostasis on {beta} cell loss in the pathogenesis of T2D that could be considered as future therapeutic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

We reconstructed and visualized the skeleton building process, quantified elemental calcium loss, and determined gene expression changes. The results suggest that different reef-building corals have diverse growing strategies in acidified seawater. A unique  cavity-like forming process starts from the inside of the skeletons of Acropora muricata, which sacrifices skeleton density to protect its polyp-canal system. The forming patterns in Pocillopora damicornis, Montipora capricornis, and M. foliosa were characterized by  osteoporosis, exhibiting disordered skeletal structures, insufficient synthesis of adhesion proteins, and low bone mass, correspondingly.

A recent case report identified a rare variant in APOE, APOE3-R136S (Christchurch), proposed to confer resistance to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether and how this variant exerts its protective effects. Methods: We introduced the R136S variant into mouse Apoe (ApoeCh) and investigated its effect on the development of AD-related pathology using the 5xFAD model of amyloidosis and the PS19 model of tauopathy. We used immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis along with single-cell spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to explore the impact of the ApoeCh variant on AD pathological development and the brain's response to plaques and tau. Results: In 5xFAD mice, ApoeCh enhances a Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) phenotype in microglia surrounding plaques, and reduces plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and plasma neurofilament light chain. By contrast, in PS19 mice, ApoeCh suppresses the microglial and astrocytic responses to tau-laden neurons and does not reduce tau accumulation or phosphorylation, but partially rescues tau-induced synaptic and myelin loss. We compared how microglia responses differ between the two mouse models to elucidate the distinct DAM signatures induced by ApoeCh. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation-related genes in the DAM response in a PS19 compared to a 5xFAD background, suggesting a differential response to amyloid versus tau pathology that is modulated by the presence of ApoeCh. Conclusions: These findings highlight the ability of the ApoeCh variant to modulate microglial responses based on the type of pathology, enhancing DAM reactivity in amyloid models and dampening neuroinflammation to promote protection in tau models. This suggests that the Christchurch variant's protective effects likely involve multiple mechanisms, including changes in receptor binding and microglial programming.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Here, we present a four-state integrase-based recorder of gene expression history and demonstrate its use in tracking gene expression events in Arabidopsis thaliana in two developmental contexts: lateral root initiation and stomatal differentiation. The recorder uses two serine integrases to mediate sequential DNA recombination events, resulting in step-wise, history-dependent switching between expression of fluorescent reporters. By using promoters that express at different times along each of the two differentiation pathways to drive integrase expression, we successfully tied fluorescent status to an ordered progression of gene expression along the developmental trajectory. In one snapshot of a mature tissue, our recorder was able to reveal past gene expression with single cell resolution.

Theory suggests that competition for space and resources should maintain the number of coexisting species far below the staggering diversity commonly found in nature. A recent model finds that, when sublinear growth rates of species are coupled with competition, species diversity can stabilize community dynamics. This, in turn, is suggested to explain the coexistence of many species in natural ecosystems. In this brief note we clarify why the sublinear growth (SG) model does not solve the long standing paradox of species coexistence. This is because in the SG model coexistence emerges from an unrealistic property, in which species per-capita growth rate diverges at low abundance, preventing species from ever going extinct. When infinite growth at low abundance is reconciled with more realistic assumptions, the SG model recovers the expected paradox: increasing diversity leads to competitive exclusion and species extinctions.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

In addition to 5-FOA resistance, we found that mutations to URA6 also confer resistance to 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In total, we identified 50 unique missense mutations across 32 residues of URA6.

Previous studies have mainly examined relative brain size, but a comprehensive understanding of brain diversity requires the investigation of other aspects of their neuroanatomy. Here, we obtained primarily post-mortem brain scans from eighteen species of the order Carnivora, reconstructed their cortical surfaces, and examined neocortical sulcal anatomy to establish a framework for systematic inter-species comparisons. We observed distinct regional variations in sulcal anatomy, potentially related to the species' behaviour and ecology. Arctoidea species with pronounced forepaw dexterity exhibited complex sulcal configurations in the presumed somatosensory cortex but low sulcal complexity in the presumed visual and auditory occipitotemporal cortex. Canidae had the largest number of unique major sulci with a unique sulcus in the occipital cortex and highly social canids featuring an additional frontal cortex sulcus. We also observed differentially complex occipito-temporal sulcal patterns in Felidae and Canidae, indicative of changes in auditory and visual areas that may be related to foraging strategies and social behaviour. In conclusion, this study presents an inventory of the sulcal anatomy of a number of rarely studied carnivoran brains and establishes a framework and novel avenues for further investigations employing a variety of neuroimaging modalities to reveal more about carnivoran brain diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Here, we introduce the Visium HD platform (10x Genomics) and use it to investigate human CRC and normal adjacent mucosal tissues from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. The first assay available on Visium HD is a probe-based spatial transcriptomics workflow that was developed to enable whole transcriptome single cell scale analysis. We demonstrate highly refined unsupervised spatial clustering in Visium HD data that aligns with the hallmarks of colon tissue morphology and is notably improved over earlier Visium assays. Using serial sections from the same FFPE blocks we generate a single cell atlas of our samples, then we integrate the data to comprehensively characterize the immune cell types present in the TME, specifically at the tumor periphery. We observed enrichment of two pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations with differential gene expression profiles that were localized within distinct tumor regions. Further characterization of the T cells present in one of the samples revealed a clonal expansion that we were able to localize in the tissue using in situ gene expression analysis. In situ analysis also allowed us to perform in-depth characterization of the microenvironment of the clonally expanded T cell population and we identified a third macrophage subpopulation with gene expression profiles consistent with an anti-tumor response. Our study provides a comprehensive map of the cellular composition of the CRC TME and identifies phenotypically and spatially distinct immune cell populations within it. We show that the single cell-scale resolution afforded by Visium HD and the whole transcriptome nature of the assay allows investigations into cellular function and interaction at the tumor periphery in FFPE tissues, which has not been previously possible.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

In this study, we quantitatively determine the functional contribution of GABABR signalling to pre- and postsynaptic domains in rat and human cortical principal cells (PC). We find that postsynaptic GABABR differentially control pyramidal cell activity within the cortical column as a function of age and species, and that these receptors contribute to co-ordination of local information processing in a layer- and species-dependent manner. These data directly increase our knowledge of translationally relevant local circuit dynamics, with direct impact on understanding the role of GABABRs in the treatment of seizure disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Whether XyG represents a key nutrient for plant-associated bacteria is unclear. The phylum Bacteroidota are abundant in the plant microbiome and provide several beneficial functions for their host. However, the metabolic and genomic traits underpinning their success remain poorly understood. Here, using proteomics, bacterial genetics, and genomics, we revealed that plant-associated Flavobacterium, a genus within the Bacteroidota, can efficiently utilise XyG through the occurrence of a distinct and conserved gene cluster, referred to as the Xyloglucan Utilisation Loci (XyGUL). Flavobacterium XyGUL is a hybrid of the molecular machinery found in gut Bacteroides spp., Cellvibrio japonicus, and the plant pathogen Xanthomonas. Combining protein biochemistry, computational modelling and phylogenetics, we identified a mutation in the enzyme required for initiating hydrolysis of the XyG polysaccharide, an outer membrane endoxyloglucanase glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 4 (GH5_4), which enhances activity towards XyG. A subclade of GH5_4 homologs carrying this mutation were the dominant form found in soil and plant metagenomes due to their occurrence in Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria. However, only in members of the Bacteroidota spp., particularly Flavobacterium spp. was such a remarkable degree of XyGUL conservation detected. We propose this mechanism enables plant-associated Flavobacterium to specialise in competitive acquisition of XyG exudates and that this hemicellulose may represent an important nutrient source, enabling them to thrive in the plant microbiome, which is typified by intense competition for low molecular weight carbon exudates.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

In the current study we first sought to determine how 10 weeks of resistance training in 15 college-aged females affected protein concentrations in different tissue fractions. Training, which promoted significantly lower body muscle- and fiber-level hypertrophy, notably increased sarcolemmal/membrane protein content (+10.1%, p<0.05). Sarcolemmal/membrane protein isolates were queried using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, ~10% (38/387) of proteins associated with the sarcolemma were up-regulated (>1.5-fold, p<0.05), and one of these targets (the intermediate filament vimentin; VIM) warranted further mechanistic investigation. VIM expression was first examined in the plantaris muscles of 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice following 10- and 20-days of MOV via synergist ablation. Relative to Sham (control) mice, VIM mRNA and protein content was significantly higher in MOV mice and immunohistochemistry indicated that VIM was predominantly present in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The 10- and 20-day MOV experiments were replicated in Pax7-DTA (tamoxifen-induced, satellite cell depleted) mice, which reduced the presence of VIM in the ECM. Finally, a third set of 10- and 20-day MOV experiments were performed in C57BL/6 mice intramuscularly injected with either AAV9-scrambled (control) or AAV9-VIM shRNA. While VIM shRNA mice presented with lower VIM in the ECM (~50%), plantaris masses in response to MOV were similar between the injection groups. However, VIM shRNA mice presented with appreciably more MyHCemb-positive fibers with centrally located nuclei, indicating a regenerative phenotype. Using an integrative approach, we propose that skeletal muscle VIM is a mechanosensitive target predominantly localized to the ECM, and satellite cells are involved in its expression. Moreover, a disruption in VIM expression during MOV leads to dysfunctional skeletal muscle hypertrophy.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

We demonstrate that the wound closes in the first 24 hours after injury by global tissue contraction. Microglia accumulation at the point of tissue convergence precedes wound closure and computational modelling of this process indicates that physical traction by microglia could lead to wound closure. Indeed, genetically or pharmacologically depleting microglia leads to defective tissue repair. Live observations indicate centripetal deformation of astrocytic processes contacted by migrating microglia. Severing such contacts leads to retraction of cellular processes, indicating tension. Weakening tension by disrupting the F-Actin stabilising gene lcp1 in microglial cells, leads to failure of wound closure. Therefore, we propose a previously unidentified mechanism of brain repair in which microglia has an essential role in contracting spared tissue.

We have previously demonstrated that signalling endosomes are transported in vivo at comparable speeds across motor neurons (MNs) innervating different hindlimb muscles, as well as between forelimb and hindlimb peripheral nerves. In contrast, axonal transport is faster in MNs compared to sensory neurons innervating the same muscle. Found periodically across the myelin sheath, Nodes of Ranvier (NoR) are short uncovered axonal domains that facilitate action potential propagation. Currently, it remains unresolved how the distinct molecular structures of the NoR impact axonal transport dynamics. Here, using intravital time-lapse microscopy of sciatic nerves in live, anaesthetised mice, we assessed diverse organelle dynamics at the NoR. We first observed that axonal morphologies were similar between fast and slow MNs, and found that signalling endosomes and mitochondria accumulate on the distal side of the NoR in both motor neuron subtypes. Assessment of axonal transport of signalling endosomes and mitochondria revealed a decrease in velocity and increase in pausing as the organelles transit through the NoR, followed by an increase in speed in the adjacent intranodal region. Collectively, this study has established axonal transport dynamics of two independent organelles at the NoR in vivo, and has relevance for several pathologies affecting peripheral nerves and the NoR, such as peripheral neuropathy, motor neuron diseases, and/or multiple sclerosis.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

However, many metazoan groups, such as the extremely diverse molluscs, are still underrepresented in the number of sequenced and annotated genomes. Although sequencing techniques have recently improved in quality and quantity, molluscs are still neglected due to difficulties in applying standardized protocols for obtaining genomic data. Results: In this study, we present the chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of the marine sacoglossan species Elysia timida, known for its ability to store the chloroplasts of its food algae. In particular, by optimizing the Long-read and chromosome conformation capture library preparations, the genome assembly was performed using PacBio HiFi and Arima HiC data. The scaffold and contig N50s, at 41.8 Mb and 1.92 Mb, respectively, are 100-fold and 4-fold higher compared to other published sacoglossan genome assemblies. Structural annotation resulted in 19,904 protein-coding genes, which are more contiguous and complete compared to publicly available annotations of Sacoglossa. We detected genes encoding polyketide synthases in E. timida, indicating that polypropionates are produced. HPLC-MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of a large number of polypropionates, including known and yet uncharacterised compounds. Conclusions: We can show that our methodological approach helps to obtain a high-quality genome assembly even for a ""difficult-to-sequence"" organism, which may facilitate genome sequencing in molluscs. This will enable a better understanding of complex biological processes in molluscs, such as functional kleptoplasty in Sacoglossa, by significantly improving the quality of genome assemblies and annotations.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

They contain large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and form biomolecular condensates that are important for transcription regulation. However, little is known about how different IDRs work together to contribute to the behaviour of CBP condensates, knowledge which is essential to fully understand their biological function. Here, we show that endogenous CBP forms fluid-like condensates in the nucleus, and that properties of CBP condensates depend on IDRs dispersed throughout its sequence. Adjacent IDRs in the C-terminus form a regulatory module that balances positive and negative contributions, to ensure that CBP condensates are responsive to other IDRs and to post translational lysine acetylation. These distinct behaviours also change the characteristics of endogenous CBP condensates, including changing patterns of chromatin localisation and altering behaviours in live cell imaging. Cooperation between different IDRs therefore ensures that CBP condensates are poised to respond to their environment, allowing CBP to effectively integrate signalling events and control diverse transcriptional outputs.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Furthermore, detection of relatively scarce isoform-specific peptides is challenging, with many protein isoforms remaining uncharted due to technical limitations. Recently, a family of advanced targeted MS strategies, termed internal standard parallel reaction monitoring (IS-PRM), have demonstrated multiplexed, sensitive detection of pre-defined peptides of interest. Such approaches have not yet been used to confirm existence of novel peptides. Here, we present a targeted proteogenomic approach that leverages sample-matched long-read RNA sequencing (LR RNAseq) data to predict potential protein isoforms with prior transcript evidence. Predicted tryptic isoform-specific peptides, which are specific to individual gene product isoforms, serve as ""triggers"" and ""targets"" in the IS-PRM method, Tomahto. Using the model human stem cell line WTC11, LR RNAseq data were generated and used to inform the generation of synthetic standards for 192 isoform-specific peptides (114 isoforms from 55 genes). These synthetic ""trigger"" peptides were labeled with super heavy tandem mass tags (TMT) and spiked into TMT-labeled WTC11 tryptic digest, predicted to contain corresponding endogenous ""target"" peptides. Compared to DDA mode, Tomahto increased detectability of isoforms by 3.6-fold, resulting in the identification of five previously unannotated isoforms. Our method detected protein isoform expression for 43 out of 55 genes corresponding to 54 resolved isoforms.

In particular, a proteinopathy of fused in sarcoma (FUS) is present in some instances of familial Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and about 10% of sporadic FTLD. Here we establish that focal injection of sonicated human FUS fibrils into brains of mice in which ALS-linked mutant or wild-type human FUS replaces endogenous mouse FUS is sufficient to induce focal cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of mutant and wild-type FUS which with time spreads to distal regions of the brain. Human FUS fibril-induced FUS aggregation in the mouse brain of humanized FUS mice is accelerated by an ALS-causing FUS mutant relative to wild-type human FUS. Injection of sonicated human FUS fibrils does not induce FUS aggregation and subsequent spreading after injection into naive mouse brains containing only mouse FUS, indicating a species barrier to human FUS aggregation and its prion-like spread. Fibril-induced human FUS aggregates recapitulate pathological features of FTLD including increased detergent insolubility of FUS and TAF15 and amyloid-like, cytoplasmic deposits of FUS that accumulate ubiquitin and p62, but not TDP-43. Finally, injection of sonicated FUS fibrils is shown to exacerbate age-dependent cognitive and behavioral deficits from mutant human FUS expression. Thus, focal seeded aggregation of FUS and further propagation through prion-like spread elicits FUS-proteinopathy and FTLD-like disease progression.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

While triple quadrupoles offer fast and sensitive nominal resolution measurements, these instruments are effectively limited to targeted proteomics. Linear ion traps (LITs) offer a versatile, cost-effective alternative capable of both targeted and global proteomics. We demonstrate a workflow using a newly released, hybrid quadrupole-LIT instrument for developing targeted proteomics assays from global data-independent acquisition (DIA) measurements without needing high-mass accuracy. Gas-phase fraction-based DIA enables rapid target library generation in the same background chemical matrix as each quantitative injection. Using a new software tool embedded within EncyclopeDIA for scheduling parallel reaction monitoring assays, we show consistent quantification across three orders of magnitude of input material. Using this approach, we demonstrate measuring peptide quantitative linearity down to 25x dilution in a background of only a 1 ng proteome without requiring stable isotope labeled standards. At 1 ng total protein on column, we found clear consistency between immune cell populations measured using flow cytometry and immune markers measured using LIT-based proteomics. We believe hybrid quadrupole-LIT instruments represent an economic solution to democratizing mass spectrometry in a wide variety of laboratory settings.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Here we analyzed B cell responses evoked by sequential Omicron infections in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Plasma neutralizing antibody titers against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variants indicate that immune imprinting is not consistently induced by inactivated or recombinant protein vaccines. However, once induced, immune imprinting is not countered by successive Omicron challenges. We compared binding specificities, neutralizing capacities, developing origins and targeting epitopes of monoclonal antibodies from individuals with or without immune imprinting. Although receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N- terminal domain (NTD) of spike are both primary targets for neutralizing antibodies, immune imprinting only shapes antibody responses to RBD by impeding the production of Omicron-specific neutralizing antibodies while facilitating the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies. We propose that immune imprinting can be either neglected by NTD-based vaccines to induce variant-specific antibodies or leveraged by RBD-containing vaccines to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies.

When present in healthy tissues in low numbers, we show that cells expressing cancer-causing mutations (KrasG12D, p53R172H) compete with normal cells for survival and are often eliminated. Thus, tumour initiation must require mechanisms whereby mutant cells override tissue defence mechanisms to remain in a tissue; however, the biology of these initial events is poorly understood. Here, we use an in vivo model of sporadic tumorigenesis in the adult pancreas to show that a population of KrasG12D- or p53R172H-expressing cells are never eliminated from the epithelium. Using RNA sequencing of non-eliminated populations and quantitative fluorescence imaging, we show that beta-catenin-independent Wnt5a signalling, and cell dormancy are key features of surviving KrasG12D cells in vivo. We demonstrate that Wnt5a (and not Wnt3a) inhibits apical extrusion of RasV12 cells in vitro by promoting stable E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions at RasV12-normal cell-cell boundaries. Inhibition of Wnt5a signalling restores E-cadherin dynamics at normal-mutant boundaries and apical extrusion in vitro. RasV12 cells arrested in the cell cycle are not extruded and this is rescued when Wnt signalling is inhibited. In the pancreas, Wnt signalling, E-cadherin and beta-catenin are increased at cell-cell contacts between non-eliminated KrasG12D cells and normal neighbours. Importantly, we demonstrate that active Wnt signalling is a general mechanism required to promote KrasG12D and p53R172H cell survival in vivo. Treatment with porcupine inhibitor rescues pancreas tissue defence by switching mutant cell retention to cell expulsion. Our results suggest that RAS mutant cells activate Wnt and a dormant cell state to avoid cell expulsion and to survive in the adult pancreas.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Its stability is controlled by two F-box protein ubiquitin ligases, FBXO22 and FBXL17. Here we show that the homodimeric BTB domain of BACH1 functions as a previously undescribed quaternary structure degron, which is deciphered by the two F-box proteins via distinct mechanisms. After BACH1 is released from chromatin by heme, FBXO22 asymmetrically recognizes a cross-protomer interface of the intact BACH1 BTB dimer, which is otherwise masked by the co-repressor NCOR1. If the BACH1 BTB dimer escapes the surveillance by FBXO22 due to oxidative modifications, its quaternary structure integrity is probed by a pair of FBXL17, which simultaneously engage and remodel the two BTB protomers into E3-bound monomers for ubiquitination. By unveiling the multifaceted regulatory mechanisms of BACH1 stability, our studies highlight the abilities of ubiquitin ligases to decode high-order protein assemblies and reveal therapeutic opportunities to block cancer invasion via compound-induced BACH1 destabilization.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

However, the definition of a unified motivational signal (i.e., reward) for integrated survival behaviours has been largely underexplored. Here, we present a novel neuroscience-inspired algorithm for synthesising robot survival behaviour without the need for complicated reward design and external feedback. Our agent, the Embodied Neural Homeostat, was trained solely with feedback generated by its internal physical state and optimised its behaviour to stabilise these internal states: homeostasis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our concept, we trained the agent in a simulated mechano-thermal environment and tested it in a real robot. We observed the synthesis of integrated behaviours, including walking, navigating to food, resting to cool down the motors, and shivering to warm up the motors, through the joint optimisation for thermal and energy homeostasis. The Embodied Neural Homeostat successfully achieved homeostasis-based integrated behaviour synthesis, which has not previously been accomplished at the motor control level. This demonstrates that homeostasis can be a motivating principle for integrated behaviour generation in robots and can also elucidate the behavioural principles of living organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

We develop an experimental apparatus that allows us to control bacterial collective behaviors by varying the strength and range of capillary forces. Combining 3D imaging and cell tracking with agent-based modeling, we demonstrate that capillary attraction organizes rod-shaped bacteria into densely packed, nematic groups, and profoundly influences their collective dynamics and morphologies. Our results suggest that capillary forces may be a ubiquitous physical ingredient in shaping microbial communities in partially hydrated environments.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

In this study, we use an unusually large number of microsatellite markers (N=91) to characterize the genetic variation of Chiricahua Leopard Frogs (Lithobates chiricahuensis) across their range in order to understand their distribution of genetic variation, identify genetic bottlenecks, and measure genetic changes over time in a single, highly-managed population. Populations were best divided into three genetically distinct clusters, with the southeastern Arizona and New Mexico populations forming distinct genetic clusters. While there is moderate genetic variation distributed across the sampled populations, each population on its own shows relatively low allelic diversity. Most populations displayed strong genetic signals of recent genetic bottlenecks or a deficiency of heterozygous genotypes that is typically associated with frequent inbreeding. Populations that have a history of no management through translocations harbored the greatest number of unique alleles and overall allelic richness, especially in a subset of the Mexican populations. Finally, long-term cohort sampling at one specific site (the Southwestern Research Station in Portal, Arizona) allowed us to demonstrate how rapidly genetic diversity can decrease across a matter of years in a population with few founders. This work shows how microsatellite markers can provide important context for conservation agencies, but even a large suite of markers beyond what is typical may not be enough for populations that are extremely bottlenecked and have low levels of standing genetic diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229936

Previous studies have shown that dehydrated mosquitoes will increase blood feeding propensity, but how this would occur over extended dry periods is unknown. Following a bloodmeal, prolonged exposure to dry conditions increased secondary blood feeding in mosquitoes by nearly two-fold, and chronic blood feeding allowed mosquitoes to survive twenty days without access to water sources. This refeeding did not alter the number of eggs generated, suggesting this refeeding is for hydration and nutrient replenishment. Exposure to desiccating conditions following a bloodmeal resulted in increased activity, decreased sleep levels, and prompted a return of CO2 sensing before egg deposition. The increased blood feeding during the vitellogenic stage and higher survival during dry periods are predicted to increase pathogen transmission and explain the elevated levels of specific arbovirus cases during dry conditions. These results solidify our understanding of the role of dry periods on mosquito blood feeding and how mosquito dehydration contributes to vectorial capacity and disease transmission dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

BA.2.86 and its descendants, including JN.1 (referred to collectively as ""JN lineages""), emerged in late 2023 and exhibited substantial genomic divergence from co-circulating XBB lineages. Methods: We analyzed patients hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness at 26 hospitals in 20 U.S. states admitted October 18, 2023-March 9, 2024. Using a test-negative, case-control design, we estimated the effectiveness of an updated 2023-2024 (Monovalent XBB.1.5) COVID-19 vaccine dose against sequence-confirmed XBB and JN lineage hospitalization using logistic regression. Odds of severe outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death, were compared for JN versus XBB lineage hospitalizations using logistic regression. Results: 585 case-patients with XBB lineages, 397 case-patients with JN lineages, and 4,580 control-patients were included. VE in the first 7-89 days after receipt of an updated dose was 54.2% (95% CI = 36.1%-67.1%) against XBB lineage hospitalization and 32.7% (95% CI = 1.9%-53.8%) against JN lineage hospitalization.

These condensates emerge from the programmed interactions of nanostructured motifs assembling from three DNA strands and one RNA strand that can include an aptamer domain for the recruitment of a target protein. Because condensates are designed to form regardless of the presence of target protein, they function as 'host' compartments. As a model protein we consider streptavidin (SA) due to its widespread use in binding assays, thus the host condensates presented here could find immediate use for the physical separation of a variety of biotin-tagged components. In addition to demonstrating protein recruitment, we describe two approaches to control the onset of condensation and protein recruitment. The first approach uses UV irradiation, a physical stimulus that bypasses the need for exchanging molecular inputs and is particularly convenient to control condensation in emulsion droplets. The second approach uses RNA transcription, a ubiquitous biochemical reaction that is central to the development of the next generation of living materials. We finally show that the combination of RNA transcription and degradation leads to an autonomous dissipative system in which host condensates and protein recruitment occur transiently, and that the host condensate size as well as the timescale of the transient can be controlled by the level of RNA degrading enzyme.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Despite the physiological importance and causal relation with human pathophysiology, little is known about the metabolism of lyso-PS in tissues other than the nervous and immune systems. To address this problem, here, we attempted to identify one (or more) lipase(s) capable of degrading lyso-PS in different mammalian tissues. We found that the membrane proteomic fraction of most mammalian tissues possess lyso-PS lipase activity, yet interestingly, the only bona fide lyso-PS lipase ABHD12 displays this enzymatic activity and has control over lyso-PS metabolism only in the mammalian brain. Using an in vitro inhibitor screen against membrane proteomic fractions of different tissues, we find that another lipase from the metabolic serine hydrolase family, ABHD6, is a putative lyso-PS lipase in the mouse liver and kidney. Finally, using pharmacological tools, we validate the lyso-PS lipase activity of ABHD6 in vivo, and functionally designate this enzyme as a major lyso-PS lipase in primary hepatocytes, and the mammalian liver and kidneys.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

This process maintains redox homeostasis and supports anaerobic survival across diverse microbial communities. Although mediated EET has been extensively leveraged for bioelectrocatalysis and bioelectronics for decades, fundamental questions remain about how these redox shuttles are reduced within cells and their bioenergetic implications. This knowledge gap limits our understanding of the physiological roles of mediated EET in various microbes and hampers the development of efficient microbial electrochemical technologies. To address this, we developed a methodology integrating genome editing, electrochemistry, and systems biology to investigate the mechanism and bioenergetic implications of mediated EET in bacteria. Using this approach, we uncovered a mediated EET mechanism in Escherichia coli. In the absence of alternative electron sinks, the redox cycling of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ) via a cytoplasmic nitroreductase enabled E. coli to respire and grow on an extracellular electrode. Genome-scale metabolic modeling suggested that HNQ- mediated EET offers a more energetically favorable route for supporting anaerobic growth than canonical fermentation. Transcriptome analysis revealed redox perturbations in response to HNQ and identified rapid metabolic adaptations that support growth. This work demonstrates that E. coli can grow independently of classical electron transport chains and fermentative pathways, unveiling a new type of anaerobic energy metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

He underwent surgical implantation of four microelectrode arrays into his left precentral gyrus, which recorded neural activity from 256 intracortical electrodes. We report a speech neuroprosthesis that decoded his neural activity as he attempted to speak in both prompted and unstructured conversational settings. Decoded words were displayed on a screen, then vocalized using text-to-speech software designed to sound like his pre-ALS voice. On the first day of system use, following 30 minutes of attempted speech training data, the neuroprosthesis achieved 99.6% accuracy with a 50-word vocabulary. On the second day, the size of the possible output vocabulary increased to 125,000 words, and, after 1.4 additional hours of training data, the neuroprosthesis achieved 90.2% accuracy.

We demonstrate that a single tree can host approximately a trillion microbes in its aboveground internal tissues, with microbial communities partitioned between heartwood and sapwood, each maintaining a distinct microbiome with minimal similarity to other plant tissues or nearby ecosystem components. Notably, the heartwood microbiome emerges as a unique ecological niche, distinguished in part by endemic archaea and anaerobic bacteria that drive consequential biogeochemical processes. Our research supports the emerging idea of a plant as a ""holobiont"", a single ecological unit comprising host and associated microorganisms, and parallels human microbiome research in its implications for host health, disease, and functionality.

We replicated the observation of periods of absent activity and decreased information between bursts of gamma power, but we show that these results are consistent with models that rely exclusively on persistent activity.

However, a major limitation of the approach is the inefficient process of homology driven recombination (HDR) from an exogenous DNA repair template. This is because error-prone, 53BP1-dependent non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) predominates at Cas9-induced double strand breaks (DSBs). Here we report the validation of a cell-permeable and non-toxic inhibitor of 53BP1 called EoHR. In vitro, EoHR prevents 53BP1 binding to dimethylated lysine 20 on histone H4, a marker of DSBs. In cells, EoHR prevents localisation of 53BP1 at nuclease mediated DSBs and promotes HDR at a Cas9-induced break. When tested in vivo during mouse Cas9-mediated gene editing, inclusion of EoHR at the time of microinjection more than doubled the recovery of correctly edited mice and halved the time to project success. Our work shows that inhibition of 53BP by EoHR is a simple and robust way to increase HDR at Cas9 breaks that can also dramatically increase the success rates of animal model generation.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

In this study, we examined whether treatment with Paxlovid in the acute phase of COVID-19 helps prevent the onset of PASC. We used electronic health records from the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 426,352 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation (TTE) framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured the onset of novel cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment did not have a significant effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.01). However, it had a protective effect on cognitive (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96) and fatigue (RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.98) symptom clusters, which suggests that the etiology of these symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1717625229937

XRN2- and T-tract-dependent termination are independent - the latter usually acting when XRN2 cannot be engaged. We show that T-tracts terminate snRNA transcription, previously thought to require the Integrator complex. Importantly, we find genome-wide termination at T-tracts in promoter-proximal regions, but not within protein-coding gene bodies.

This study employed repeated training intervention interspersed with a detraining period to assess epigenetic memory of HIIT. METHODS: Twenty healthy subjects (25{+/-}5yrs) completed two HIIT interventions (training and retraining) lasting 2 months, separated by 3 months of detraining. Measurements at baseline, after training, detraining and retraining included maximal oxygen consumption ([V]O2max). Vastus lateralis biopsies were taken for genome-wide DNA methylation and targeted gene expression analyses. RESULTS: V'O2max improved during training and retraining (p<0.001) without differences between interventions (p>0.58). Thousands of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) predominantly demonstrated a hypomethylated state after training, retained even after 3-months exercise cessation and into retraining. Five genes; ADAM19, INPP5a, MTHFD1L, CAPN2, SLC16A3 possessed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with retained hypomethylated memory profiles and increased gene expression. The retained hypomethylation during detraining was associated with an enhancement in expression of the same genes even after 3 months of detraining. SLC16A3, INPP5a, CAPN2 are involved in lactate transport and calcium signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar physiological adaptations between training and retraining, memory profiles were found at epigenetic and gene expression level, characterized by retained hypomethylation and increased gene expression after training into long-term detraining and retraining. These genes were associated with calcium signaling and lactate transport. Whilst significant memory was not observed in physiological parameters, our novel findings indicate that human skeletal muscle possesses an epigenetic memory of HIIT.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

These fluorescent proteins (FPs) have enabled the real-time observation of protein localization and dynamics within live cells. Applications of FP vary from monitoring gene/protein expression patterns, visualizing protein-protein interactions, measuring protein stability, assessing protein mobility and creating biosensors. The utility of FPs also extends to biochemical approaches through immunoblotting and proteomic analyses, aided by anti-FP antibodies and nanobodies. FPs are notoriously robust proteins with a tightly folded domain that confers a strong stability and a relative resistance to degradation and denaturation. In this study, we report that various green and red FPs can be maintained in a native, fluorescent form during the entire process of protein sample extraction, incubation with sample buffer, loading and migration on SDS-PAGE with only minor adaptations of traditional protocols. This protocol results in the ability to detect and quantify in-gel fluorescence (IGF) of endogenously-expressed proteins tagged with FPs directly after migration, using standard fluorescence-imaging devices. This approach eliminates the need for antibodies and chemiluminescent reagents, as well as the time-consuming steps inherent to immunoblotting such as transfer onto a membrane and antibody incubations. Overall, IGF detection provides clearer data with less background interference, a sensitivity comparable or better to antibody-based detection, a better quantification and a broader dynamic range. After fluorescence imaging, gels can still be used for other applications such as total protein staining or immunoblotting if needed. It also expands possibilities by allowing the detection of FPs for which antibodies are not available. Our study explores the feasibility, limitations, and applications of IGF for detecting endogenously expressed proteins in cell extracts, providing insights into sample preparation, imaging conditions, and sensitivity optimizations, and potential applications such as co-immunoprecipitation experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

The scale of data generated on novel instrumentation and acquisition strategies pose a challenge to bioinformatic analysis. Search engines need to make optimal use of the data for biological discoveries while remaining statistically rigorous, transparent and performant. Here we present alphaDIA, a modular open-source search framework for data independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics. We developed a feature-free identification algorithm particularly suited for detecting patterns in data produced by sensitive time-of-flight instruments. It naturally adapts to novel, more eTicient scan modes that are not yet accessible to previous algorithms. Rigorous benchmarking demonstrates competitive identification and quantification performance. While supporting empirical spectral libraries, we propose a new search strategy named end-to-end transfer learning using fully predicted libraries. This entails continuously optimizing a deep neural network for predicting machine and experiment specific properties, enabling the generic DIA analysis of any post-translational modification (PTM). AlphaDIA provides a high performance and accessible framework running locally or in the cloud, opening DIA analysis to the community.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Molecular recognition is typically considered through the lens of sequence-specific binding events. However, a growing body of work has shown that IDRs often interact with partners in a manner that does not depend on the precise order of the amino acid order, instead driven by complementary chemical interactions leading to disordered bound-state complexes. Despite this emerging paradigm, we lack tools to describe, quantify, predict, and interpret these types of structurally heterogeneous interactions from the underlying amino acid sequences. Here, we repurpose the chemical physics developed originally for molecular simulations to develop an approach for predicting intermolecular interactions between IDRs and partner proteins. Our approach enables the direct prediction of phase diagrams, the identification of chemically-specific interaction hotspots on IDRs, and a route to develop and test mechanistic hypotheses regarding IDR function in the context of molecular recognition. We use our approach to examine a range of systems and questions to highlight its versatility and applicability.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is currently the most widely accepted MS method in the clinic, due to its reliability and analytical performance. However, due to limited throughput and the difficulty in setting up and analyzing large scale assays, SRM and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) are typically used only for very refined assays of on the order of 100 targets or less. Here we introduce a new MS platform with a quadrupole mass filter, collision cell, linear ion trap architecture that has increased acquisition rates compared to the analogous hardware found in the Orbitrap Tribrid series instruments. The platform can target more analytes than existing SRM and PRM instruments - in the range of 5000 to 8000 peptides per hour. This capability for high multiplexing is enabled by acquisition rates of 70-100 Hz for peptide applications, and the incorporation of real-time chromatogram alignment that adjusts for retention time drift and enables narrow time scheduled acquisition windows. Finally, we describe a Skyline external software tool that implements the building of targeted methods based on data independent acquisition chromatogram libraries or unscheduled analysis of heavy labeled standards. We show that the platform delivers ~10x lower LOQs than traditional SRM analysis for a highly multiplex assay and also demonstrate how analytical figures of merit change while varying method duration with a constant number of analytes, or by keeping a constant time duration while varying the number of analytes.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

The huge number of scientific articles using the term arousal ([~]50.000) highlights the importance of the concept, but also explains why such a vast literature had never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. Meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature further reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a domain-general cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we found that dysgranular insular area 7, the region with highest convergence across varieties of arousal, also shows activation specific to arousal. Our results show that arousal corresponds to a construct at least partially shared across different domains of neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

We used Pan-M to create Nimbus, a deep learning model to predict marker positivity from multiplexed image data. Nimbus is a pre-trained model that uses the underlying images to classify marker expression across distinct cell types, from different tissues, acquired using different microscope platforms, without requiring any retraining. We demonstrate that Nimbus predictions capture the underlying staining patterns of the full diversity of markers present in Pan-M.

Diverse microorganisms have nevertheless been detected within caves, though it remains unclear what strategies enable them to meet their energy and carbon needs. Here we determined the processes and mediators of primary production in aerated limestone and basalt caves through paired metagenomic and biogeochemical profiling. Based on 1458 metagenome-assembled genomes, over half of microbial cells in caves encode enzymes to use atmospheric trace gases as energy and carbon sources. The most abundant microbes in these systems are chemosynthetic primary producers, notably the novel gammaproteobacterial methanotrophic order Ca. Methylocavales and two uncultivated actinobacterial genera predicted to grow on atmospheric hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. In situ and ex situ biogeochemical and isotopic measurements consistently confirmed that these gases are rapidly consumed at rates sufficient to meet community-wide energy needs and drive continual primary production. Conventional chemolithoautotrophs, which use trace lithic compounds such as ammonium and sulfide, are also enriched and active alongside these trace gas scavengers. These results indicate that caves are unique in both their microbial composition and the biogeochemical processes that sustain them. Based on these findings, we propose caves are the first known ecosystems where atmospheric trace gases primarily sustain growth rather than survival and define this process as  aerotrophy. Cave aerotrophy may be a hidden process supporting global biogeochemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

The identification of ASD risk genes from exome-wide association studies and de novo variation analyses has enabled mechanistic investigations into how ASD-risk genes alter development. Most functional genomics studies have focused on the role of these genes in neurons and progenitor cells. However, roles for ASD risk genes in other cell types are largely uncharacterized. There is evidence from postmortem tissue that microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, appear activated in ASD. Here, we systematically assess the impact of ASD-risk gene knock-down on microglial uptake of synaptic material. We developed both an iPSC-derived microglia-neuron coculture system and high-throughput flow cytometry readout for synaptic uptake to enable CRISPRi-based screening. Our screen identified ADNP, one of the high-confidence ASD risk genes, amongst others as a modifier of microglial synaptic uptake. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional analyses revealed that ADNP plays a role in endocytosis, cell surface remodeling, and motility in microglia. Through this focused investigation into the role of ADNP in microglia, we also found preliminary evidence for WNT signaling coordinating microglial uptake of synaptic material.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

In plants, due to the absence of cell migration, correct placement of newly produced cell walls during cell division is of eminent importance for generating functional tissues and organs. In particular, during radial growth of plant shoots and roots, concerted cell divisions in the cambium are essential to produce adjacent xylem and phloem tissues in a strictly bidirectional manner. While several intercellular signaling cascades have been identified to instruct tissue organization during radial growth, a role of mechanical forces in guiding cambium stem cell activity has been frequently proposed but, so far, not been functionally investigated on the cellular level. Here, we coupled anatomical analyses with a cell-based vertex model to analyze the role of mechanical stress in radial plant growth at the cell and tissue scale. Simulations based on segmented cellular outlines of radially growing Arabidopsis hypocotyls revealed a distinct stress pattern with circumferential stresses in cambium stem cells which coincided with the orientation of cortical microtubules. Integrating stress patterns as a cue instructing cell division orientation was sufficient for the emergence of typical cambium-derived cell files and agreed with experimental results for stress-related tissue organization in confining mechanical environments. Our work thus underlines the significance of mechanical forces in tissue organization through self-emerging stress patterns during the growth of plant organs.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Even without adaptive immunity, insects have evolved potent innate immune strategies to neutralize such enemies, including nematodes and parasitoid wasps. One such strategy relies on endosymbioses between insects and toxin-expressing bacteria. Here, we use genome editing in Drosophila melanogaster to retrace the evolution of two of such toxins -- cytolethal distending toxin B (cdtB) and apoptosis inducing protein of 56kDa (aip56) -- that were horizontally transferred from bacteriophages to insects. We found that a cdtB::aip56 fusion gene (fusionB), which is conserved in Drosophila ananassae subgroup species, dramatically promoted fly survival and suppressed wasp development when expressed in D. melanogaster immune tissues. FusionB, a functional nuclease, was secreted into the host hemolymph where it targeted the parasitoid embryo's serosal tissue and is to our knowledge the first humoral anti-parasitoid toxin in Drosophila. When expressed ubiquitously, fusionB slowed development in late stage fly larvae and eventually killed flies, pointing to the salience of regulatory constraint in preventing autoimmunity. Our findings demonstrate how horizontal gene transfer, in the right regulatory context, can instantly provide new and potent innate immune modules in animals.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1717625229937

Here, we used translating ribosome affinity purification methods to define the circadian translatomes of astrocytes, microglia, and bulk cerebral cortex, in healthy mouse brain and in the settings of amyloid-beta plaque pathology or aging. Our data reveal that glial circadian translatomes are highly cell type-specific and exhibit profound, context-dependent reprogramming of rhythmic transcripts in response to amyloid pathology or aging. Transcripts involved in glial activation, immunometabolism, and proteostasis, as well as nearly half of all Alzheimer Disease (AD)-associated risk genes, displayed circadian oscillations, many of which were altered by pathology. Amyloid-related differential gene expression was also dependent on time of day. Thus, circadian rhythms in gene expression are cell- and context dependent and provide important insights into glial gene regulation in health, AD, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Balance of the activity in these canonical direct-indirect pathways is considered a core requirement for normal movement control, and their imbalance is a major etiologic factor in movement disorders including Parkinsons disease. We present evidence for a conceptually equivalent parallel system of direct-D1 and indirect-D2 pathways that arise from striatal projection neurons (SPNs) of the striosome compartment rather than from the matrix. These striosomal direct (S-D1) and indirect (S-D2) pathways, as a pair, target dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra (SNpc) instead of the motor output nuclei of the basal ganglia. The novel anatomically and functionally distinct indirect-D2 striosomal pathway targets dopaminergic SNpc cells indirectly via a core region of the external pallidum (GPe). We demonstrate that these S-D1 and S-D2 pathways oppositely modulate striatal dopamine release in freely behaving mice under open-field conditions and oppositely modulate locomotor and other movements. These S-D1 and S-D2 pathways further exhibit different, time-dependent responses during performance of a probabilistic decision-making maze task and respond differently to rewarding and aversive stimuli. These contrasts depend on mediolateral and anteroposterior striatal locations of the SPNs as are the classic direct and indirect pathways. The effects of S-D1 and S-D2 stimulation on striatal dopamine release and voluntary locomotion are nearly opposite. The parallelism of the direct-indirect circuit design motifs of the striosomal S-D and S-D2 circuits and canonical matrix M-D1 and M-D2, and their contrasting behavioral effects, call for a major reformulation of the classic direct-indirect pathway model of basal ganglia function. Given that some striosomes receive limbic and association cortical inputs, the S-D1 and S-D2 circuits likely influence motivation for action and behavioral learning, complementing and possibly reorienting the motoric activities of the canonical matrix pathways. At a fundamental level, these findings suggest a unifying framework for aligning two sets of circuits that share the organizational motif of opponent D1 and D2 regulation, but that have different outputs and can even have opposite polarities in their targets and effects, albeit conditioned by striatal topography. Our findings further delineate a potentially therapeutically important set of pathways influencing dopamine, including a D2 receptor-linked S-D2 pathway likely unknowingly targeted by administration of many therapeutic drugs including those for Parkinsons disease. The novel parallel pathway model that we propose here could help to account for the normally integrated modulatory influence of the basal ganglia on motivation for actions as well as the actions themselves.

Interactions between BMP ligands and their main antagonist, Chordin, establish BMP gradients, subdivide embryos into distinct territories and organise body plans. However, the molecular control and evolutionary origins of dorsal-ventral patterning within spiralians, one of the three major bilaterian groups, have been obscured by their unique embryonic development. Here we present the chromosome-level genome of a spiralian with deuterostome-like development, the brachiopod Lingula anatina, and apply functional transcriptomics to study dorsal-ventral patterning under the control of BMP signalling. We uncover the presence of a dorsal-ventral BMP signalling gradient in the L. anatina gastrula with bmp2/4 and chordin expressed at its dorsal and ventral sides, respectively. Using small-molecule drugs, exogenous recombinant BMP proteins and RNA sequencing, we show that a high level of BMP pathway activation inhibits the expression of neural genes during gastrula and larval stages. We also show that BMP signalling splits the developing larval shell field into two valves. The discovery of a BMP-mediated dorsal-ventral patterning system in a spiralian, similar to those observed in deuterostomes and non-spiralian protostomes, suggests deep conservation of this mechanism across all three major bilaterian clades. This is further supported by striking similarities in the gene sets regulated by BMP signalling in brachiopods and the vertebrate model Xenopus. We argue that the spiralian ancestor retained the basal bilaterian mechanism of dorsal-ventral patterning, although downstream components of the BMP-Chordin network have undergone dynamic evolutionary changes.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

To elucidate neural mechanisms compatible with human visual processing, we need an animal model that behaves similarly to humans, so that inferred neural mechanisms can provide hypotheses relevant to the human brain. Here we assessed whether rhesus macaques could model human context-driven object recognition by quantifying visual object identification abilities across variations in the amount, quality, and congruency of contextual cues. Behavioral metrics revealed strikingly similar context-dependent patterns between humans and monkeys. However, neural responses in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of monkeys that were never explicitly trained to discriminate objects in context, as well as current artificial neural network models, could only partially explain this cross-species correspondence. The shared behavioral variance unexplained by context-naive neural data or computational models highlights fundamental knowledge gaps. Our findings demonstrate an intriguing alignment of human and monkey visual object processing that defies full explanation by either brain activity in a key visual region or state-of-the-art models.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Here, we leverage weighted de Bruijn graphs as graphical probability models representing the relative abundances and qualities of kmers within FASTQ-encoded observations. We then utilize these weighted de Bruijn graphs to identify alternate, higher-likelihood candidate sequences compared to the original observations, which are known to contain errors. By improving the original observations with these resampled paths, iteratively across increasing k-lengths, we can use this expectation-maximization approach to ""polish"" read sets from any sequencing technology according to the mutual information shared in the reads. We use this polishing approach to probabilistically correct simulated short- and long-read datasets of lower coverages and higher error rates than some algorithms can produce satisfactory assemblies for.

Extensive genome sequencing efforts are currently in progress across a broad spectrum of life forms, holding the potential to unravel the intricate branching patterns within the tree of life. However, estimating species trees starting from raw genome sequences is quite challenging, and the current cutting-edge methodologies require a series of error-prone steps that are neither entirely automated nor standardized. In this paper, we present ROADIES, a novel pipeline for species tree inference from raw genome assemblies that is fully automated, easy to use, scalable, free from reference bias, and provides flexibility to adjust the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime. The ROADIES pipeline eliminates the need to align whole genomes, choose a single reference species, or pre-select loci such as functional genes found using cumbersome annotation steps. Moreover, it leverages recent advances in phylogenetic inference to allow multi-copy genes, eliminating the need to detect orthology. Using the genomic datasets released from large-scale sequencing consortia across three diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, and birds), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality with the state-of-the-art approaches but in a fraction of the time. By incorporating optimal approaches and automating all steps from assembled genomes to species and gene trees, ROADIES is poised to improve the accuracy, scalability, and reproducibility of phylogenomic analyses.

The most common genetic causes are mutations in the CLN3 gene encoding a lysosomal protein. There are currently no therapies targeting the progression of the disease, mostly due to the lack of knowledge about the disease mechanisms.

To gain insight into the impact of CLN3 loss on cellular signaling and organelle function, we generated CLN3 knock-out cells in a human cell line (CLN3-KO), and performed RNA sequencing to obtain the cellular transcriptome. Following a multi-dimensional transcriptome analysis, we identified the transcriptional regulator YAP1 as a major driver of the transcriptional changes observed in CLN3-KO cells.

We further observed that YAP1 pro-apoptotic signaling is hyperactive as a consequence of CLN3 functional loss in retinal pigment epithelia cells, and in the hippocampus and thalamus of CLN3ex{Delta}7/8 mice, an established model of Batten disease. Loss of CLN3 activates YAP1 by a cascade of events that starts with the inability of releasing glycerophosphodiesthers from CLN3-KO lysosomes, which leads to perturbations in the lipid content of the nuclear envelope and nuclear dysmorphism. This results in increased number of DNA lesions, activating the kinase c-Abl, which phosphorylates YAP1, stimulating its pro-apoptotic signaling.

Altogether, our results highlight a novel organelle crosstalk paradigm in which lysosomal metabolites regulate nuclear envelope content, nuclear shape and DNA homeostasis. This novel molecular mechanism underlying the loss of CLN3 in mammalian cells and tissues may open new c-Abl-centric therapeutic strategies to target Batten disease.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

A long-standing hypothesis postulates that scales are homologous to the well-described mechanosensory bristles found in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where both derive from an epithelial precursor specified by lateral inhibition that then undergoes multiple rounds of division. Previous histological examination and candidate gene approaches identified parallels in genes involved in scale and bristle development. Here, we provide definitive developmental and transcriptomic evidence that the differentiation of lepidopteran scales derives from the canonical cell lineage, known as the Sensory Organ Precursor (SOP). Live imaging in moth and butterfly pupae shows that SOP cells undergo two rounds of asymmetric divisions that first abrogate the neurogenic lineage, and then lead to a differentiated scale precursor and its associated socket cell. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing across a time-series of early pupal development revealed differential gene expression patterns that mirror canonical lineage development, including Notch-Delta signalling components, cell adhesion molecules, cell cycling factors, and terminal cell differentiation markers, suggesting a shared origin of the SOP developmental program. Additionally, we recovered a novel gene, the POU-domain transcription factor pdm3, involved in the proper differentiation of butterfly wing scales.

Phase separation is mediated by multivalent interactions of biological macromolecules including intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDRs). Despite considerable advances in experiments, theory and simulations, the prediction of the thermodynamics of IDR phase behaviour remains challenging. We combined coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and active learning to develop a fast and accurate machine learning model to predict the free energy and saturation concentration for phase separation directly from sequence. We validate the model using both experimental and computational data. We apply our model to all 27,663 IDRs of chain length up to 800 residues in the human proteome and find that 1,420 of these (5%) are predicted to undergo homotypic phase separation with transfer free energies <-2 kBT. We use our model to understand the relationship between single-chain compaction and phase separation, and find that changes from charge- to hydrophobicity-mediated interactions can break the symmetry between intra- and inter-molecular interactions. We also analyse the structural preferences at condensate interfaces and find substantial heterogeneity that is determined by the same sequence properties as phase separation. Our work refines the established rules governing the relationships between sequence features and phase separation propensities, and our prediction models will be useful for interpreting and designing cellular experiments on the role of phase separation, and for the design of IDRs with specific phase separation propensities.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Despite covariation with age structure, reproductive and environmental variables do not influence the scale of synchrony, except for a moderate effect of beech masting.

Here, we introduce AFsample2, a method employing random MSA column masking to reduce the influence of co-evolutionary signals to enhance the structural diversity of models generated by the AF2 neural network. AFsample2 improves the prediction of alternative states for a broad range of proteins, yielding high-quality end states and diverse conformational ensembles. In the data set of open-closed conformations (OC23), alternate state models improved in 17 out of 23 cases without compromising the generation of the preferred state. Consistent results were observed in 16 membrane protein transporters, with improvements in 12 out of 16 targets. TM-score improvements to experimental end states were substantial, sometimes exceeding 50%, elevating mediocre scores from 0.58 to nearly perfect 0.98. Furthermore, AFsample2 increased the diversity of intermediate conformations by 70% compared to the standard AF2 system, producing highly confident models that could potentially be on-path between the two states. In addition, we also propose a way of selecting the end-states in generated model ensembles. These solutions could potentially enhance the generation and identification of alternative protein conformations, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of protein function and dynamics. Future work will focus on validating the accuracy of these intermediate conformations and exploring their relevance to functional transitions in proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937
"The mod-minimizer: a simple and efficient sampling algorithm for long k-mers","10.1101/2024.05.25.595898","biorxiv",19.5,3.1,12.9,19.5,19.5,"Groot Koerkamp, R.; Pibiri, G.

Specifically, it samples the smallest k-mer according to the order O from each window of w consecutive k-mers in S. Because consecutive windows can sample the same k-mer, the set of the sampled k-mers is typically much smaller than S. This makes the minimizer a versatile tool to reduce the memory footprint and processing time of several applications in bioinformatics, such as sequence comparison, assembly, compacted De Bruijn graph construction, and sequence indexing. More generally, we consider substring sampling algorithms that respect a window guarantee: at least one k-mer must be sampled from every window of w consecutive k-mers. As a sampled k-mer is uniquely identified by its absolute position in S, we can define the density of a sampling algorithm as the fraction of distinct sampled positions. Good methods have low density which, by respecting the window guarantee, is lower bounded by 1/w. It is however difficult to design a sequence-agnostic algorithm with provably optimal density. In practice, the order O is usually implemented using a pseudo-random hash function to obtain the so-called random minimizer. This scheme is simple to implement, very fast to compute even in streaming fashion, and easy to analyze. However, its density is almost a factor of 2 away from the lower bound for large windows. Prior work has thus focused on methods that achieve lower density than the random minimizer, both in theory and practice. Nonetheless, those methods remain difficult to analyze and intuitively understand, and are not always as versatile as random minimizers. Methods: In this work we introduce mod-sampling, a two-step sampling algorithm to obtain new minimizer schemes. Given a (small) parameter t, the mod-sampling algorithm finds the position p of the smallest t-mer in a window. It then samples the k-mer at position p mod w. The lr-minimizer uses t = k - w and the mod-minimizer uses t {equiv} k (mod w). Results: These new schemes have provably lower density than classic random minimizers and other schemes when k is large compared to w, while being as fast to compute. Importantly, the mod-minimizer achieves optimal density when k [-&gt;] {infty}. Although the mod-minimizer is not the first method to achieve optimal density for large k, its proof of optimality is simpler than previous work. We provide pseudocode for a number of other methods and compare to them. In practice, the mod-minimizer has considerably lower density than the random minimizer and other state-of-the-art methods, like closed syncmers and miniception, when k > w. We plugged the mod-minimizer into SSHash, a k-mer dictionary based on minimizers. For default parameters (w, k) = (11, 21), space usage decreases by 15% when indexing the whole human genome (GRCh38), while maintaining its fast query time.

Recent functional MRI studies using multi-voxel pattern classification analyses showed that unconscious contents could be decoded from brain activity patterns. However, decoding does not imply a full understanding of neural representations. Here we re-analysed data from a high-precision fMRI study coupled with representational similarity analysis based on convolutional neural network models to provide a detailed information-based approach to neural representations of both unconscious and conscious perceptual content. The results showed that computer vision model representations strongly predicted brain responses in ventral visual cortex and in fronto-parietal regions to both conscious and unconscious contents. Moreover, this pattern of results generalised when the models were trained and tested with different participants. Remarkably, these observations results held even when the analysis was restricted to observers that showed null perceptual sensitivity. In light of the highly distributed brain representation of unconscious information, we suggest that the functional role of fronto-parietal cortex in conscious perception is unlikely to be related to the broadcasting of information, as proposed by the global neuronal workspace theory, and may instead relate to the generation of meta-representations as proposed by higher-order theories.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

However, the impact of inducing a wound, such as those from biopsies, on the progression of established tumors remains largely unknown. In this study, we examine the transcriptional heterogeneity of cancer cells in human basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and identify a wound response-associated gene program as a prominent feature of invasive cancer cells. We find that invasive cancer cells are prevalent in ulcerated BCC tumors and exhibit a distinctive spatial organization. To explore the causal relationship between wounding and cancer progression, we compare tumors at baseline and one week after biopsy. Our results reveal that biopsy collection locally induces a transcriptional switch in cancer cells from an indolent to an invasive state. Notably, this progression is coupled with the reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts, which adopt a transcriptional state characteristic of therapy-resistant BCC. This study provides evidence that wounding triggers invasive progression of established human tumors and warrants further research on the potentially harmful effects of biopsies and wound-inducing treatments.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Unknown species with similarity to known genomes cause database bias in reference-based metagenomics. To improve surveillance, we designed this study to recover sewage genomes and develop a quantification and correlation workflow for these genomes and AMR over time. We used longitudinal sewage sampling in seven treatment plants from five major European cities to explore the utility of catch-all sequencing of these population-level samples.

Using metagenomic assembly methods, we recovered 2,332 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from prokaryotic species, 1,334 of which were previously undescribed. These genomes account for [~]69% of sequenced DNA and provide insight into sewage microbial dynamics.

Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Copenhagen (Denmark) showed strong seasonal microbial community shifts, while Bologna, Rome, (Italy) and Budapest (Hungary) had occasional blooms of Pseudomonas-dominated communities, accounting for up to [~]95% of sample DNA. Seasonal shifts and blooms present challenges for effective sewage surveillance. We find that bacteria of known shared origin, like human gut microbiota, form communities, suggesting the potential for source-attributing novel species and their ARGs through network community analysis. This could significantly improve AMR tracking in urban environments.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Furthermore, the cell-intrinsic requirement for IL-7 signaling during memory homeostasis has not been directly tested. Using inducible deletion, we found that Il7ra loss had only a modest effect on persistence of circulating memory and TRM subsets and that IL-7R was primarily required for normal basal proliferation. Loss of IL-15 signaling imposed heightened IL-7R dependence on memory CD8+ T cells, including TRM populations previously described as IL-15-independent. In the absence of IL-15 signaling, IL-7R was upregulated, and loss of IL-7R signaling reduced proliferation in response to IL-15, suggesting cross-regulation in memory CD8+ T cells. Thus, across subsets and tissues, IL-7 and IL-15 act in concert to support memory CD8+ T cells, conferring resilience to altered availability of either cytokine.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

We addressed this issue in a foraging task for mice where multiple decision variables are simultaneously encoded even if, at any given time, only one of them is used. We found that characteristic features of the face simultaneously encode not only the currently used decision variables, but also independent and unexpressed ones, and we show that these features partially originate from neural activity in the secondary motor cortex.

Current leading hypotheses propose that a symbiosis between an asgardarchaeal host cell and an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont represented a crucial step in eukaryotic origins and invoke a central role for syntrophic interactions - that is, metabolic cross-feeding between the partners as the basis for their subsequent evolutionary integration. A major unanswered question is whether the metabolism of modern eukaryotes bears any vestige of this ancestral interaction. To investigate this question in detail, we systematically analyze the evolutionary origins of the eukaryotic gene repertoires mediating central carbon metabolism. Our phylogenetic and sequence analyses reveal that this gene repertoire is chimeric, with ancestral contributions from Asgardarchaeota and Alphaproteobacteria operating predominantly in glycolysis and TCA, respectively. Furthermore, our analyses reveal diverse additional contributions from other prokaryotic sources as well as the extent to which this ancestral metabolic interplay has been remodeled via gene loss, transfer, and subcellular retargeting in the >2Ga since the origin of eukaryotic cells. Together, our work demonstrates that in contrast to previous assumptions, the eukaryotic metabolism preserves information about the nature of the original asgardarchaeal-alphaproteobacterial interactions, and supports syntrophy scenarios on the origin of the eukaryotic cell.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

The recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery.

2. We evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised 30 paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, 60 in total, each containing six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was replicated over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were reversed, yielding 60 treatment and 60 control sites and 720 artificial nests.

3. Diversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year.

4. Diversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1717625229937

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1717625229937

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Recently, the emergence and dominance of the JN.1 lineage over XBB variants have prompted a reevaluation of current vaccine strategies. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of XBB-based vaccines against JN.1, concerns persist regarding the durability of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses against evolving JN.1 subvariants. In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera. These results underscore the challenge posed by the continuously evolving SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 and support the consideration of switching the focus of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine updates to the JN.1 lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. The comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar across sex, age (65-74/[&ge;]75 years), number of previous covid-19 vaccine doses received, and seasonal influenza vaccination co-administration subgroups and periods of either omicron XBB- or BA.2.86-sublineage dominance. While the protection was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, it was well-preserved at end of week 12 of follow-up.

ConclusionAmong adults aged [&ge;]65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine reduced the rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death during autumn and winter 2023-2024 across three Nordic countries.","NA","medrxiv",1717625229937

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717625229937

Recently, H5 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have caused large outbreaks in avian and multiple non-human mammalian species1,2. Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera3-6. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning7 to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind 2-6-linked sialic acids, and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine strains. Overall, the systematic nature of deep mutational scanning combined with the safety of pseudoviruses enables comprehensive measurements of the phenotypic effects of mutations that can inform real-time interpretation of viral variation observed during surveillance of H5 influenza.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1717625229937
