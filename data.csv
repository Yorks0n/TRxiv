MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several potential treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were assessed in separate comparisons in RECOVERY, both of which are reported here. Eligible and consenting adults could join the molnupiravir comparison, the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, or both. For each comparison, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the relevant antiviral (five days of molnupiravir 800mg twice daily or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 300mg/100mg twice daily) or to usual care without the relevant antiviral drug, using web-based unstratified randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Both comparisons were stopped by the investigators because of low recruitment. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 24 January 2022 to 24 May 2023, 923 patients were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated molnupiravir and 478 allocated usual care), and from 31 March 2022 to 24 May 2023, 137 patients were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 allocated usual care). More than three-quarters of the patients in both comparisons were vaccinated and had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (including remdesivir or sotrovimab). In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) patients allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28; p=0.66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) patients allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.47-2.23; p=0.96). In neither comparison was there evidence of a significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of patients progressing to invasive ventilation or death.

InterpretationIn adults hospitalised with COVID-19, neither molnupiravir nor nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death although these comparisons had limited statistical power due to low recruitment.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1717884277839

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1717884277839

However, it is presently unknown if and how such bursts of organismal diversity are influenced by temporal niche partitioning, wherein species avoid competition by being active during different time windows. Here, we address this question through profiling temporal activity patterns in the exceptionally diverse fauna of cichlid fishes from African Lake Tanganyika. By integrating week-long longitudinal behavioural recordings of over 500 individuals from 60 species with eco-morphological and genomic information, we provide two lines of evidence that temporal niche partitioning facilitated this massive adaptive radiation. First, Tanganyikan cichlids exhibit all known circadian temporal activity patterns (diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular, and cathemeral) and display substantial inter-specific variation in daily amounts of locomotion. Second, many species with similar habitat and diet niches occupy distinct temporal niches. Moreover, our results suggest that shifts between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns are facilitated by a crepuscular intermediate state. In addition, genome-wide association studies indicate that the genetics underlying activity patterns is complex, with different clades associated with different combinations of variants. The identified variants were not associated with core circadian clock genes but with genes implicated in synapse function. These observations indicate that temporal niche partitioning contributed to adaptive radiation in cichlids and that many genes are associated with the diversity and evolution of temporal activity patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

A core feature of the consolidation process is offline replay of neuronal firing patterns that occur during experience7,8. This replay is thought to originate in the hippocampus and trigger the reactivation of ensembles of cortical and subcortical neurons1,3,9-18. However, non-declarative memories do not require the hippocampus for learning or for sleep-dependent consolidation19-26 meaning what drives their consolidation is unknown. Here we show, using an unsupervised method, that replay occurs in the dorsal striatum of mice during offline consolidation of a non-declarative, procedural, memory and that this replay is generated independently of the hippocampus. Replay occurred at both real-world and time-compressed speeds and was also prioritised both at the level of the individual neurons and the type of neural sequence. Complete bilateral lesions of the hippocampus had no effect on any feature of this replay. Our results demonstrate that procedural replay during consolidation of a non-declarative memory is independent of the hippocampus. These results support the view that replay drives active consolidation of all types of memory during sleep but challenges the idea that the hippocampus is the source of this replay.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

However, there are substantial differences in their execution of every step of the work that also make it impossible for the authors to claim that they are replicating our experiments or protocols. Based on these differences, we do not believe there is an issue of robustness or reliability in our TEI findings, but rather that Hunter and colleagues have in fact not tested the central condition of TEI -- that is, small RNA production by bacteria and subsequent uptake by C. elegans -- nor have they carried out proper behavioral and imaging assays to assess this behavior. Our subsequent work shows that indeed this example of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is not just observed in laboratory settings with PA14, but is also induced by wild strains of Pseudomonas, exhibiting its robustness. Just as we offered advice and training to Hunter and colleagues, we are happy to advise anyone who wishes to learn this assay.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

To analyze both intra- and intergenomic variation in phased genome assemblies, we have made the software package PanTools ploidy-aware by updating the pangenome graph representation and adding several novel functionalities to assess synteny and gene retention, profile repeats and calculate synonymous and nonsynyonymous mutation rates. Using PanTools, we constructed and analyzed a pangenome comprising of one diploid and four tetraploid potato cultivars, and a pangenome of five diploid apple species. Both pangenomes show high intra- and intergenomic allelic diversity in terms of gene absence/presence, SNPs, indels and larger structural variants.

However, natural populations frequently violate this assumption, which may potentially confound genome-wide association studies, selection scans, and demographic inference. Within several recently admixed human populations, empirical genetic studies have reported a correlation in global ancestry proportion between spouses, referred to as ancestry-assortative mating. Here, we use forward genomic simulations to link correlations in ancestry between mates to the underlying mechanistic mate-choice process. We consider the impacts of two types of mate-choice model, using either ancestry-based preferences or social groups as the basis for mate pairing. We find that multiple mate-choice models can produce the same correlations in ancestry proportion between spouses; however, we also highlight alternative analytic approaches and circumstances in which these models may be distinguished. With this work, we seek to highlight potential pitfalls when interpreting correlations in empirical data as evidence for a particular model of human mating practices, as well as to offer suggestions toward development of new best practices for analysis of human ancestry-assortative mating.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

The oscillation of the segmentation clock is a well-studied model of developmental tempo. While the clock period is known to scale with the kinetics of gene expression and degradation processes of the core clock gene Hes7 across mammalian species, how these key molecular processes are coordinated remains unclear. In this study, we investigated if metabolic activities act as a global modulator for the segmentation clock, finding that they are rather selective modulators. While several metabolic inhibitions extended the clock period, their effects on the key processes varied. Inhibition of glycolysis decelerated the protein degradation of Hes7 and extended the production delay but did not influence the intron delay. Electron transport chain inhibition extended Hes7 intron delay without influencing the other two processes. Combinations of distinct metabolic inhibitions exhibited synergistic effects. By contrast, temperature changes affected the clock period and all three key processes simultaneously. These results highlight the selective effects of metabolic activities on segmentation clock processes, hinting that their scaled kinetics across species may be achieved through combinations of multiple modulators.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Using pooled in vitro fertilization, we generate and characterize a genetic reference panel of Diversity Outbred PSCs (n = 230). Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of pooled culture of Diversity Outbred EpiSCs as ""cell villages"", which can facilitate the differentiation of large numbers of EpiSC lines for forward genetic screens. These data can complement and inform similar efforts within the stem cell biology and human genetics communities to model the impact of natural genetic variation on phenotypic variation and disease-risk.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

It has been isolated as part of the gut microbiome of animals and insects, as well as from stool samples of patients with diarrhea. Specific P. alcalifaciens strains encode gene homologs of virulence factors found in other pathogenic members of the same Enterobacterales order, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri. Whether these genes are also pathogenic determinants in P. alcalifaciens is not known. Here we have used P. alcalifaciens 205/92, a clinical isolate, with in vitro and in vivo infection models to investigate P. alcalifaciens-host interactions at the cellular level. Our particular focus was the role of two type III secretion systems (T3SS) belonging to the Inv-Mxi/Spa family. T3SS1b is widespread in Providencia spp. and encoded on the chromosome. T3SS1a is encoded on a large plasmid that is present in a subset of P. alcalifaciens strains, which are primarily isolates from diarrheal patients. Using a combination of electron and fluorescence microscopy and gentamicin protection assays we show that P. alcalifaciens 205/92 is internalized into eukaryotic cells, rapidly lyses its internalization vacuole and proliferates in the cytosol. This triggers caspase-4 dependent inflammasome responses in gut epithelial cells. The requirement for the T3SS1a in entry, vacuole lysis and cytosolic proliferation is host-cell type specific, playing a more prominent role in human intestinal epithelial cells as compared to macrophages. In a bovine ligated intestinal loop model, P. alcalifaciens colonizes the intestinal mucosa, inducing mild epithelial damage with negligible fluid accumulation. No overt role for T3SS1a or T3SS1b was seen in the calf infection model. However, T3SS1b was required for the rapid killing of Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that the acquisition of two T3SS by horizontal gene transfer has allowed P. alcalifaciens to diversify its host range, from a highly virulent pathogen of insects to an opportunistic gastrointestinal pathogen of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Yet, studies rarely, if ever, consider the possibility that systematic differences in inner experience (i.e., what subjects think and feel during the scan) may directly affect FC measures. Here we demonstrate that is the case using a rs-fMRI dataset comprising 471 scans annotated with experiential data. Wide-spread significant differences in FC are observed between scans that systematically differ in terms of reported in-scanner experience. Additionally, we show that FC can successfully predict specific aspects of in-scanner experience in a manner similar to how it predicts demographics, cognitive abilities, clinical outcomes and labels.

The layers and areas are distinguished both molecularly, by diverse neuronal and glial cell subtypes, and structurally, through intricate spatial organization. While single-cell transcriptomics studies have advanced molecular characterization of human cortical development, a critical gap exists due to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation. Here, we utilized multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), augmented with deep-learning-based cell segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular, and cytoarchitectural development of human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing 16 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across four time points in the second and third trimesters. We uncovered an early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable in the laminar distribution of excitatory neuronal subtypes by mid-gestation, long before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, while anterior-posterior gradients of neuronal subtypes were generally observed in most cortical areas, a striking exception was the sharp molecular border between primary (V1) and secondary visual cortices (V2) at gestational week 20. Here we discovered an abrupt binary shift in neuronal subtype specification at the earliest stages, challenging the notion that continuous morphogen gradients dictate mid-gestation cortical arealization. Moreover, integrating single-nuclei RNA-sequencing and in situ whole transcriptomics revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific Layer 4 neurons, suggesting a role of synaptogenesis in this discrete border formation. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This work not only provides a valuable resource for the field, but also establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm that paves the way for a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

The oscillation period of the human segmentation clock, as measured in induced presomitic mesoderm (iPSM) cells, is two times longer than that of mouse. While the core clock gene HES7 is known to show slower protein degradation in human iPSM compared with mouse iPSM, it remains unclear whether the concept of species-specific protein stability is generalizable to other genes. Here we systematically compared the protein degradation rates of approximately 5000 genes between human and mouse iPSM by using dynamic SILAC-based proteomics, demonstrating a pervasive trend of slower protein degradation in human cells. The inter-species difference was observed not only for proteasome-mediated but also for lysosome-mediated degradation. We further investigated the effect of metabolism on the protein stability profile. Treating mouse iPSM cells with a glycolysis inhibitor extended the segmentation clock period, aligning the protein stability profile more closely with that of human cells, though with less effect on lysosome-mediated degradation. These results highlight the universality of slower protein degradation in human development compared with mouse, and suggest metabolism as one of the modulators.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of pubertal mammary fibroblasts, achieved using single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial mapping, and in vivo lineage tracing. Notably, we discovered a transient niche-forming population of specialized contractile fibroblasts that exclusively localize around the tips of the growing mammary epithelium and are recruited from the surrounding fat pad. Using functional organoid-fibroblast co-cultures we reveal that different fibroblast populations can acquire contractile features when in direct contact with the epithelium, promoting morphogenesis.

One major cell state change is senescence, which is associated with dramatic changes in cell metabolism, including increases in lipid metabolism, but how cells accommodate such alterations is poorly understood. Here, we show that the transcription factor p53 enables recycling of the lipid headgroups required to meet the increased demand for membrane phospholipids during senescence. p53 activation increases supply of phosphoethanolamine (PEtn), an intermediate in the Kennedy pathway for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), by transactivating genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal catabolism that enable membrane turnover. Disruption of PEtn conversion to PE is well-tolerated in the absence of p53 but results in dramatic organelle remodeling and perturbs growth and gene expression following p53 activation. Consistently, CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens reveal that p53-activated cells preferentially depend on genes involved in lipid metabolism. Together, these results reveal lipid headgroup recycling to be a homeostatic function of p53 that confers a cell-state specific metabolic vulnerability.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Recently, it was shown that AP-3 is in a constitutively open, active conformation compared to the related AP-1 and AP-2 coat complexes, which are inactive until undergoing large conformational changes upon membrane recruitment. How AP-3 is regulated is therefore an open question. To understand the mechanism of AP-3 membrane recruitment and activation, we reconstituted the core of human AP-3 and determined multiple structures in the soluble and membrane-bound states using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Similar to yeast AP-3, human AP-3 is in a constitutively open conformation, with the cargo-binding domain of the 3 subunit conformationally free. To reconstitute AP-3 activation by the small GTPase Arf1, we used lipid nanodiscs to build Arf1-AP-3 complexes on membranes and determined three structures that show the stepwise conformational changes required for formation of AP-3 coated vesicles. First, membrane-recruitment is driven by one of two predicted Arf1 binding sites on AP-3. In this conformation, AP-3 is flexibly tethered to the membrane and its cargo binding domain remains conformationally dynamic. Second, cargo binding causes AP-3 to adopt a fixed position and rigidifies the complex, which stabilizes binding for a second Arf1 molecule. Finally, binding of the second Arf1 molecule provides the template for AP-3 dimerization, providing a glimpse into the first step of coat polymerization. We propose coat polymerization only occurs after cargo engagement, thereby linking cargo sorting with assembly of higher order coat structures. Additionally, we provide evidence for two amphipathic helices in AP-3, suggesting that AP-3 contributes to membrane deformation during coat assembly. In total, these data provide evidence for the first stages of AP-3 mediated vesicle coat assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

To our knowledge, a comprehensive assessment of the financial net benefits of digital endpoints in clinical trials has not been conducted.

Data and MethodsWe obtained data from the Digital Medicine Society (DiMe) Library of Digital Endpoints and the U.S. clinical trials registry, ClinicalTrials.gov. The benefit metrics are changes in trial phase duration and enrollment associated with the use of digital endpoints. The cost metric was obtained from an industry survey of the costs of including digital endpoints in clinical trials. We developed an expected net present value (eNPV) model of the cash flows for new drug development and commercialization to assess financial value. The value measure is the increment in eNPV that occurs when digital endpoints are employed. We also calculated a return on investment (ROI) as the ratio of the estimated increment in eNPV to the mean digital endpoint implementation cost.

ResultsFor phase 2 trials, the increase in eNPV varied from $2.2 million to $3.3 million, with ROIs between 32% to 48% per indication. The net benefits were substantially higher for phase 3 trials, with the increase in eNPV varying from $27 million to $48 million, with ROIs that were four to seven times the investment.

ConclusionsThe use of digital endpoints in clinical trials can provide substantial extra value to sponsors developing new drugs, with high ROIs.","NA","medrxiv",1717884277839

Nevertheless, the COVID-19 epidemic continues, albeit with low rates of severe illness, and hybrid immunity holders are becoming more common in these populations. It is necessary to determine the immunological protection correlates against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection in individuals with hybrid immunity because the currently available immune correlates were established by analyzing individuals possessing vaccine-induced immunity only. Methods We conducted an ad hoc prospective cohort study to measure serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in 4,496 Japanese adults as part of the national COVID-19 seroepidemiological survey.

Concurrently, we assessed the concentration of proteins associated with AD and neuroinflammation in the plasma of the same subjects. We found that the abundance of proinflammatory CXCR3+CD127+ Type 1 T helper (Th1) cells in AD patients was negatively correlated with the abundance of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein.

But as these designs expand to multigene systems it becomes challenging to sequence these in a cost-effective way that reveals the genotype to phenotype relationships in the libraries. Here, we introduce a new quick, low-cost method designed for assessing combinational designs of genome-integrated multigene constructs that we call Pool of Long Amplified Reads (POLAR) sequencing. POLAR-seq takes genomic DNA isolated from library pools and uses long range PCR to amplify target genomic regions up to 35 kb long containing combinatorial designs. The pool of long amplicons is then directly read by nanopore sequencing with full length reads then used to identify the gene content and structural variation of individual genotypes in the library and read count indicating how abundant a genotype is within the pool. Using yeast cells with loxP-containing synthetic gene clusters that rearrange in vivo in the presence of Cre recombinase, we demonstrate how POLAR-seq can be used to identify global patterns from combinatorial experiments, find the most abundant genotypes in a pool and also be adapted to sequence-verify gene clusters from isolated strains.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

This study examines how race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status influence Lp(a) ordering.

MethodsThis is a single center, retrospective study (2/1/2020-6/30/2023) using electronic medical records of adults with at least one ICD-10 diagnosis of ASCVD or resistant hyperlipidemia (LDL-C >160 mg/dL on statin therapy). We evaluated Lp(a) level differences among racial/ethnic groups and sexes. We also assessed associations between diagnosis type, diagnosis number, age at diagnosis, race, socioeconomic score (based on zip codes), public health coverage and presence of Lp(a) orders.

Results4% of our cohort (N=56,833) had an Lp(a) order (17.3% Hispanic, 8.7% non-Hispanic Black, 47.5% non-Hispanic White and, 27% Asian/others). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients had lower rates of Lp(a) orders (0.17%, 0.28%, respectively) when compared to non-Hispanic White patients (2.35%), p<0.001, however, their median Lp(a) levels were higher. Individuals belonging to deprived socioeconomic groups or on Medicaid, were less likely to have an Lp(a) order (RR=0.39, p<0.001 and RR=0.40, p<0.001 respectively). Certain diagnoses (carotid stenosis, family history of ASCVD and FH) and multiple diagnoses (>2) resulted in more Lp(a) orders compared to those with only one diagnosis (p<0.001).

ConclusionsLp(a) ordering is low in patients with ASCVD. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients at risk are less likely to have an Lp(a) order. Individuals residing in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods and on Medicaid are also less like have Lp(a) order.

Since tumor development is regulated by the immune system, we hypothesize that sex-biased immune interactions underpin sex differences in cancer. The male-biased glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive and treatment-refractory tumor in urgent need of more innovative approaches - such as considering sex differences - to improve outcomes. GBM arises in the specialized brain immune environment dominated by microglia, so we explored sex differences in this immune cell type. We isolated adult human TAM-MGs (tumor-associated macrophages enriched for microglia) and control microglia and found sex-biased inflammatory signatures in GBM and lower-grade tumors associated with pro-tumorigenic activity in males and anti-tumorigenic activity in females. We demonstrated that genes expressed or modulated by the inactive X chromosome facilitate this bias. Together, our results implicate TAM-MGs - specifically their sex chromosomes - as drivers of male bias in GBM.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Form-I RuBisCO complexes uniquely harbor small subunits that form a hexadecameric complex together with their large subunits. The small subunit protein is thought to have significantly contributed to RuBisCO s response to the atmospheric rise of O2 ~2.5 billion years ago, marking a pivotal point in the enzyme s evolutionary history. Here, we performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of extant and ancestral RuBisCO sequences and structures to explore the impact of the small subunit s earliest integration on the molecular dynamics of the overall complex. Our simulations suggest that the small subunit restricted the conformational variability of the large subunit early in its history, constraining the evolutionary trajectory of the Form-I RuBisCO. Molecular dynamics investigations of CO2 and O2 gas distribution around predicted ancient RuBisCOs suggest that a proposed CO2 reservoir role for the small subunit is not conserved throughout the enzyme s evolutionary history. The evolutionary and biophysical response of RuBisCO to changing atmospheric conditions on ancient Earth showcase multi-level and trackable responses of enzymes to environmental shifts over long timescales.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

ROS and RCS extensively damage cellular biomolecules and organelles, affecting plant's viability and development. Emerging reports highlight that the multi-stress responding DJ-1 superfamily proteins are critical in attenuating cytotoxic effects associated with abiotic stress. The current report, validated in yeast and plant models, shows that AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E are robust antioxidants that scavenge ROS and improve survival under oxidative stress. Although they lack conventional glyoxalases and do not attenuate the glycation of proteins, AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E preserve the GSH pool and regulate redox homeostasis. Moreover, transcriptome profiling indicates that levels of AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E are rapidly established to counter heat and oxidative stress conditions. Notably, the knockdown of AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E promotes detrimental alterations such as reduced chlorophyll retention, impaired root morphogenesis, and induced sensitivity to heat stress due to ROS elevation. Contrastingly, overexpression of AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E improved plant height and rosette formation under physiological conditions. In conclusion, our study unravels the pivotal functions of Arabidopsis thaliana DJ-1C and DJ-1E in governing plant health and survival under heat and oxidative stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Computational denoising methods can bypass imaging constraints and improve signal-to-noise ratio in images. However, current state of the art methods are commonly trained in a supervised manner, requiring paired noisy and clean images, limiting their application across diverse datasets. An alternative class of denoising models can be trained in a self-supervised manner, assuming independent noise across samples but are unable to generalize from available unpaired clean images. A method that can be trained without paired data and can use information from available unpaired high-quality images would address both weaknesses. Here, we present Baikal, a first attempt to formulate such a framework using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for fluorescence microscopy images. We first train a DDPM backbone in an unconditional manner to learn generative priors over complex morphologies in microscopy images. We then apply various conditioning strategies to sample from the trained model and propose an optimal strategy to denoise the desired image. Extensive quantitative comparisons demonstrate better performance of Baikal over state of the art self-supervised methods across multiple datasets. We highlight the advantage of generative priors learnt by DDPMs in denoising complex Flywing morphologies where other methods fail. Overall, our DDPM based denoising framework presents a new class of denoising methods for fluorescence microscopy datasets that achieve high performance without collection of paired high-quality images.

Here, we derived human placental organoids from early gestation trophoblast stem cells to (1) identify patterns of immunomodulatory protein expression by trophoblast subtype and (2) evaluate the effects of the placental organoid secretome on immune cell activation and regulation.

They contain large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and form biomolecular condensates that are important for transcription regulation. However, little is known about how different IDRs work together to contribute to the behaviour of CBP condensates, knowledge which is essential to fully understand their biological function. Here, we show that endogenous CBP forms fluid-like condensates in the nucleus, and that properties of CBP condensates depend on IDRs dispersed throughout its sequence. Adjacent IDRs in the C-terminus form a regulatory module that balances positive and negative contributions, to ensure that CBP condensates are responsive to other IDRs and to post translational lysine acetylation. These distinct behaviours also change the characteristics of endogenous CBP condensates, including changing patterns of chromatin localisation and altering behaviours in live cell imaging. Cooperation between different IDRs therefore ensures that CBP condensates are poised to respond to their environment, allowing CBP to effectively integrate signalling events and control diverse transcriptional outputs.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Many Gram-negative bacteria that encode PQQ-dependent enzymes do not possess the biosynthetic machinery for its production and instead obtain it from the environment. To achieve this the bacterium Escherichia coli uses the TonB-dependent transporter PqqU as a high-affinity PQQ importer, allowing it to use PQQ at an external concentration as low as 1 nM. Here, we show that PqqU achieves this by binding PQQ with a very high affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy we determine the structure of the PqqU-PQQ complex at a resolution of 1.99 angstrom, revealing that the extracellular loops of PqqU undergo significant conformational changes upon PQQ binding, which captures the cofactor in an internal cavity. This cavity likely facilitates an airlock-style gating mechanism that prevents non-specific import through PqqU. Using structural modelling we show that the change in PqqU structure upon PQQ binding precludes the binding of bacteriophage, which targets it as a cell surface receptor. Guided by the PqqU-PQQ complex structure we use phenotypic analysis to identify the amino acids essential for PQQ import and leverage this information to map the presence of PqqU across Gram-negative bacteria. This reveals that PqqU is encoded by Gram-negative bacteria from at least 22 phyla from diverse habitats, including those found in aquatic, soil, host-associated, and extreme environments. This indicates that PQQ is a ubiquitous nutrient in many environments, and an important cofactor for bacteria that adopt diverse lifestyles and metabolic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

A short-term increase in reliance on social information under these conditions has been experimentally shown in primates, including humans, but whether this occurs in other taxa is unknown. By conducting a large-scale cultural diffusion experiment, we asked whether migration between spatially variable environments affected social information use in great tits (Parus major), a small passerine bird that can socially learn novel behaviors. We simulated an immigration event where knowledgeable birds were exchanged between groups with opposing preferences for a socially learned foraging puzzle, living in similar or different environments. We found evidence that both immigrants and residents were influenced by social information and attended to the rewards that others received. Our analysis supported the use of a payoff-biased social learning by immigrants when both resources and habitat features were spatially variable. In contrast, immigrants relied more-so on individual learning when payoffs or the environment were unchanged. In summary, our results suggest that great tits assess the payoffs others receive, and are more influenced by socially observed differences in payoffs when environmental cues differ in their new environment. Our results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that spatial variation is a strong driver for the evolution of social learning strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

This study describes hospital care of pediatric catatonia patients and compares treatments for neurotypical patients and those with NDDs. Methods: Retrospective cohort study from 1/1/2018 to 6/1/2023 of two academic medical centers of patients aged 18 and younger with catatonia. Patients were retrospectively assessed using the clinical global impressions-improvement (CGI-I) by two independent reviewers. Results: One hundred sixty-five patients were hospitalized for catatonia, of whom 50.3% had an NDD. Median age was 15. One hundred sixty-four patients were treated with a benzodiazepine, with a median maximum 24-hour dose of 6 mg lorazepam-equivalents, which did not differ for patients with and without NDDs. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was utilized in 14.5% of patients. Median length of medical hospitalization was 5 days and hospitalizations were longer in neurotypical patients than in patients with NDDs. In an ordinal regression model, the probability of observing at least much improvement (CGI < 3) was 88.3% (95% CI: 82.4% to 92.3%), with NDD diagnosis associated with a lower odds of clinical response. Conclusions: The probability of patients achieving a CGI-I score indicating at least much improvement was 88.3%.

Here, we examined gene family evolution of 1,154 genomes from nearly all known species in the medically and technologically important yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. We found that yeast gene family and genome evolution are distinct from plants, animals, and filamentous ascomycetes and are characterized by small genome sizes and smaller gene numbers but larger gene family sizes. Faster-evolving lineages (FELs) in yeasts experienced significantly higher rates of gene losses, commensurate with a narrowing of metabolic niche breadth, but higher speciation rates than their slower-evolving sister lineages (SELs). Gene families most often lost are those involved in mRNA splicing, carbohydrate metabolism, and cell division and are likely associated with intron loss, metabolic breadth, and non-canonical cell cycle processes. Our results highlight the significant role of gene family contractions in the evolution of yeast metabolism, genome function, and speciation, and suggest that gene family evolutionary trajectories have differed markedly across major eukaryotic lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

BA.2.86 and its descendants, including JN.1 (referred to collectively as ""JN lineages""), emerged in late 2023 and exhibited substantial genomic divergence from co-circulating XBB lineages. Methods: We analyzed patients hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness at 26 hospitals in 20 U.S. states admitted October 18, 2023-March 9, 2024. Using a test-negative, case-control design, we estimated the effectiveness of an updated 2023-2024 (Monovalent XBB.1.5) COVID-19 vaccine dose against sequence-confirmed XBB and JN lineage hospitalization using logistic regression. Odds of severe outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death, were compared for JN versus XBB lineage hospitalizations using logistic regression. Results: 585 case-patients with XBB lineages, 397 case-patients with JN lineages, and 4,580 control-patients were included. VE in the first 7-89 days after receipt of an updated dose was 54.2% (95% CI = 36.1%-67.1%) against XBB lineage hospitalization and 32.7% (95% CI = 1.9%-53.8%) against JN lineage hospitalization.

Here, we introduce the Visium HD platform (10x Genomics) and use it to investigate human CRC and normal adjacent mucosal tissues from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. The first assay available on Visium HD is a probe-based spatial transcriptomics workflow that was developed to enable whole transcriptome single cell scale analysis. We demonstrate highly refined unsupervised spatial clustering in Visium HD data that aligns with the hallmarks of colon tissue morphology and is notably improved over earlier Visium assays. Using serial sections from the same FFPE blocks we generate a single cell atlas of our samples, then we integrate the data to comprehensively characterize the immune cell types present in the TME, specifically at the tumor periphery. We observed enrichment of two pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations with differential gene expression profiles that were localized within distinct tumor regions. Further characterization of the T cells present in one of the samples revealed a clonal expansion that we were able to localize in the tissue using in situ gene expression analysis. In situ analysis also allowed us to perform in-depth characterization of the microenvironment of the clonally expanded T cell population and we identified a third macrophage subpopulation with gene expression profiles consistent with an anti-tumor response. Our study provides a comprehensive map of the cellular composition of the CRC TME and identifies phenotypically and spatially distinct immune cell populations within it. We show that the single cell-scale resolution afforded by Visium HD and the whole transcriptome nature of the assay allows investigations into cellular function and interaction at the tumor periphery in FFPE tissues, which has not been previously possible.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Extensive EGL proliferation characterises the foliated structure of amniote cerebella, but the factors that regulate EGL formation, amplification within it, and differentiation from it, are incompletely understood. Here, we characterise bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling during cerebellar development in chick and human and show that while in chick BMP signalling correlates with external granule layer formation, in humans BMP signalling is maintained throughout the external granule layer after the onset of foliation. We also show via Immunohistochemical labelling of phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 the comparative spatiotemporal activity of BMP signalling in chick and human. Using in-ovo electroporation in chick, we demonstrate that BMP signalling is necessary for subpial migration of granule cell precursors and hence the formation of the external granule layer (EGL) prior to transit amplification. However, altering BMP signalling does not block the formation of mature granule neurons but significantly disrupts that pattern of morphological transitions that accompany transit amplification. Our results elucidate two key, temporally distinct roles for BMP signalling in vivo in organising first the assembly of the EGL from the rhombic lip and subsequently the tempo of granule neuron production within the EGL.

Significance statementImproper development of cerebellar granule neurons can manifest in a plethora of neurodevelopmental disorders, including but not limited to medulloblastoma and autism. Many studies have sought to understand the role of developmental signalling pathways in granule cell neurogenesis, using genetic manipulation in transgenic mice. To complement these insights, we have used comparative assessment of BMP signalling during development in chick and human embryos and in vivo manipulation of the chick to understand and segregate the spatiotemporal roles of BMP signalling, yielding important insights on evolution and in consideration of future therapeutic avenues that target BMP signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

We examined if such dynamics involves changes in chromatin organization by profiling the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of SPGs from early postnatal stages to adulthood in mice using deep RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and computational deconvolution analyses. By integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic features, we show that SPGs undergo massive chromatin remodeling during postnatal development that partially correlates with distinct gene expression profiles and transcription factors (TF) motif enrichment. We identify genomic regions with significantly different chromatin accessibility in adult SPGs that are marked by histone modifications associated with enhancers and promoters. Some of the regions with increased accessibility correspond to transposable element subtypes enriched in multiple TFs motifs and close to differentially expressed genes. Our results underscore the dynamics of chromatin organization in developing germ cells and complement existing datasets on SPGs by providing maps of the regulatory genome at high resolution from the same cell populations at early postnatal, late postnatal and adult stages collected from single individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

This study reveals the existence of a transient two-layer structure of the developing chick pallium, mirroring the order of neocortical layers as well as the proliferation-dependent mode of specification that is partly regulated by microRNA-19b.

Through the analysis of sex-specific transcriptomes of adult Tribolium castaneum, we identified a homologue of snake waprin (Tc_WapF) with significantly higher level of its transcripts in females. Developmental- and tissue-specific profiling revealed the widespread expression of Tc_WapF in adult female tissues. Interestingly, Tc_WapF expression is not regulated by the classical sex-determination cascade of T. castaneum, as we fail to get any attenuation in Tc_WapF transcript levels in Tcdsx and Tctra (key players of sex determination cascade of T. castaneum) knockdown females. The eggs laid by Tc_WapF knockdown females never hatched, indicating the involvement of Tc_WapF in the embryonic development in T. castaneum. This is the first report of identification a sex-specific waprin homologue in an insect and its involvement as a novel candidate in the embryonic development. Future investigations on the functional conservation of insect waprins and their mechanistic role in embryonic development can be exploited for improving pest management strategies.

However, current knowledge on host-microbiome interactions is limited to effects of the microbiome during post-embryonic development. Elucidating mechanisms and consequences of host-microbe communication during embryonic development, particularly in oviparous organisms is a notable gap. Protected from the chorionic fluid and considered to be sterile, embryonic development in oviparous organisms is typically considered to be independent of the influence of the microbiome. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the external microbiome influences embryonic development in oviparous organisms despite lack of physical contact. We utilized zebrafish (Danio rerio) reared germ-free (GF) and conventionalized with microbes (CV) at different times during embryonic development to examine changes in the embryonic transcriptome, proteome, and physiology during embryogenesis at 32 hours post-fertilization. Our results contrast the conventional notion that zebrafish embryos are shielded from the external microbial environment by their protective chorion until hatching. We demonstrate the external microbial community influences embryonic transcript and protein abundance associated with critical developmental processes including energy metabolism and neurodevelopment. While these pathways are previously identified to be influence by microbes during post-embryonic stages, here, we reveal a significant role of the surrounding aquatic microbial community in regulating these processes as early as embryogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the external microbial community differentially regulates cytochrome P450 driven xenobiotic metabolism and associated bioenergetic and behavioral responses following exposure to a CYP1A activator during embryogenesis. These findings transform our interpretation and consideration of embryonic development as a function of microbial cues and genetic blueprints, enhance knowledge of fundamental processes governing vertebrate embryonic development, and expand comprehension of host-microbe communication.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Translational control of mRNAs plays an essential role in germ cell gene regulation. Messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes assemble on mRNAs as they move from the nucleus into perinuclear germ granules to exert both positive and negative post-transcriptional regulation in the cytoplasm. In C. elegans, germ granules are surprisingly dynamic mRNP condensates that remodel during development. Two eIF4E isoforms (called IFE-1 and IFE-3), eIF4E-Interacting Proteins (4EIPs), RBPs, DEAD-box helicases, polyadenylated mRNAs, Argonautes and miRNAs all occupy positions in germ granules. Affinity purification of IFE-1 and IFE-3 allowed mass spectrometry and mRNA-Seq to identify the proteins and mRNAs that populate stable eIF4E mRNPs. We find translationally controlled mRNAs (e.g. pos-1, mex-3, spn-4, etc.) enriched in IFE-3 mRNPs, but excluded from IFE-1 mRNPs. These mRNAs also require IFE-1 for efficient translation. The findings support a model in which oocytes and embryos utilize the two eIF4Es for opposite purposes on critically regulated germline mRNAs. Careful colocalization of the eIF4Es with other germ granule components suggests an architecture in which GLH-1, PGL-1 and the IFEs are stratified to facilitate sequential interactions for mRNAs. Biochemical characterization demonstrates opposing yet cooperative roles for IFE-3 and IFE-1 to hand-off of translationally controlled mRNAs from the repressed to the activated state, respectively. The model involves eIF4E mRNPs shuttling mRNAs through nuclear pore-associated granules/condensates to cytoplasmic ribosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Using transcriptomics analysis, we show that during their two-day period of growth deceleration, wing imaginal discs of Drosophila undergo a progressive metabolic shift away from oxidative phosphorylation and towards glycolysis. We then develop an ultra-sensitive reporter HIF-1 activity, which reveals that imaginal discs become increasingly hypoxic during development in normoxic conditions, suggesting that limiting oxygen supply could underlie growth deceleration. Growth is energetically expensive and thus expected to contribute, indirectly, to oxygen consumption. Indeed, excess TOR signalling, a key stimulator of growth, triggers hypoxia locally and systemically, highlighting the need to rein in growth when oxygen becomes limiting. This is achieved by a negative feedback loop whereby the classic TOR-inhibitory function of HIF-1 is deployed in response to developmental hypoxia. The absence of Sima/HIF-1 leads to cellular stress, which is alleviated by reduced TOR signalling. Conversely, a small increase in oxygen supply reduces the stress induced by excess TOR activity. We conclude that mild hypoxia is a normal feature of organ development and that Sima/HIF-1 prevents growth-induced oxygen demand from exceeding supply.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki.

Here, we report the discovery of an alternative pathway mediating Sec metabolisation that is independent of SCLY and mediated by peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PRDX6 can readily react with selenide and interact with SEPHS2, potentially acting as a selenium delivery system. Moreover, we demonstrate the presence and functional significance of this alternative route in cancer cells where we reveal a notable association between elevated expression of PRDX6 with a highly aggressive neuroblastoma subtype.

Here we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed LaBeRling, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic cells. LaBeRling is non-disruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

Tanning bed radiation is often thought of as a substitute for natural UV radiation despite differences in the maximum doses, UV content, body sites exposed, and patterns of melanoma that arise. Methods: To better understand the epidemiologic trends and etiology of melanoma associated with tanning bed use, we described the patterns of melanoma in patients with quantifiable tanning bed usage and performed exome sequencing of 182 melanocytes from normal skin of a subset of these patients. Results: Tanning bed users were more likely than non-users to have melanoma on body sites with low cumulative levels of sun damage and were more likely to have multiple melanomas. The melanocytes in normal appearing skin from tanning bed users had higher mutation burdens, a higher proportion of melanocytes with pathogenic mutations, and distinct mutational signatures. These differences were most prominent over body sites that experience comparatively less exposure to natural sunlight. Conclusions: We conclude that tanning bed radiation induces melanoma by increasing the mutation burden of melanocytes and by mutagenizing a broader field of melanocytes than are typically exposed to natural sunlight. The unique signatures of mutations in skin cells of tanning users may be attributable to the distinct spectra of radiation emitted from solariums.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Theory suggests that competition for space and resources should maintain the number of coexisting species far below the staggering diversity commonly found in nature. A recent model finds that, when sublinear growth rates of species are coupled with competition, species diversity can stabilize community dynamics. This, in turn, is suggested to explain the coexistence of many species in natural ecosystems. In this brief note we clarify why the sublinear growth (SG) model does not solve the long standing paradox of species coexistence. This is because in the SG model coexistence emerges from an unrealistic property, in which species per-capita growth rate diverges at low abundance, preventing species from ever going extinct. When infinite growth at low abundance is reconciled with more realistic assumptions, the SG model recovers the expected paradox: increasing diversity leads to competitive exclusion and species extinctions.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Here, we present a four-state integrase-based recorder of gene expression history and demonstrate its use in tracking gene expression events in Arabidopsis thaliana in two developmental contexts: lateral root initiation and stomatal differentiation. The recorder uses two serine integrases to mediate sequential DNA recombination events, resulting in step-wise, history-dependent switching between expression of fluorescent reporters. By using promoters that express at different times along each of the two differentiation pathways to drive integrase expression, we successfully tied fluorescent status to an ordered progression of gene expression along the developmental trajectory. In one snapshot of a mature tissue, our recorder was able to reveal past gene expression with single cell resolution. In this way, we were able to capture heterogeneity in stomatal development, confirming the existence of two alternate paths of differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Procarbazine in eBEACOPP (escalated dose bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisolone) is increasingly replaced with dacarbazine (eBEACOPDac) to reduce toxicity, although limited genomic and clinical data support this substitution. Methods To assess mutagenic and clinical consequences of dacarbazine-procarbazine substitutions, we compared mutational landscapes in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients treated with different Hodgkin regimens and children, sperm and bowel tissue from procarbazine-treated patients. We compared efficacy and toxicity data of a multicentre eBEACOPDac-treated patient cohort, with eBEACOPP clinical trial and real-world datasets. Results eBEACOPP-treated patients exhibit a higher burden of point mutations, small insertions and deletions in HSPCs compared to eBEACOPDac and ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine)-treated patients. Two novel mutational signatures, SBSA (SBS25-like) and SBSB were identified in HSPCs, neoplastic and normal colon from only procarbazine-treated patients. SBSB was also identified in germline DNA of three children conceived post-eBEACOPP and sperm of an eBEACOPP-treated male. The dacarbazine substitution did not appear to compromise efficacy; 3-year progression-free survival of 312 eBEACOPDac patients (93.3%; CI95=90.3-96.4%) mirrored that of 1945 HD18-trial eBEACOPP patients (93.3%; CI95=92.1-94.4%). eBEACOPDac-treated patients required fewer blood transfusions, demonstrated higher post-chemotherapy sperm concentrations, and experienced earlier resumption of menstrual periods. Conclusions Procarbazine induces a higher mutational burden and novel mutational signatures in eBEACOPP-treated patients and their germline DNA raising concerns for hereditary consequences. However, replacing procarbazine with dacarbazine appears to mitigate gonadal and stem cell toxicity while maintaining comparable clinical efficacy.","NA","medrxiv",1717884277839

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, nitrogen starvation has distinct physiological consequences depending on the presence of mating partners. In their absence, cells enter quiescence, and TORC1 inactivation prolongs their life. In presence of compatible mates, TORC1 inactivation is essential for sexual differentiation. Gametes engage in paracrine pheromone signaling, grow towards each other, fuse to form the diploid zygote, and form resistant, haploid spore progenies. To understand the signaling changes in the proteome and phospho-proteome during sexual reproduction, we developed cell synchronization strategies and present (phospho-)proteomic datasets that dissect pheromone from starvation signals over the sexual differentiation and cell-cell fusion processes. Unexpectedly, these datasets reveal phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 during sexual development, which we establish requires TORC1 activity. We demonstrate that TORC1 is re-activated by pheromone signaling, in a manner that does not require autophagy. Mutants with low TORC1 re-activation exhibit compromised mating and poorly viable spores. Thus, while inactivated to initiate the mating process, TORC1 is reactivated by pheromone signaling in starved cells to support sexual reproduction.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

We explore ProteinMPNN in the context of designing therapeutic proteins that need to avoid triggering unwanted immune reactions. More specifically, we focus on intra-cellular proteins that face the challenge of evading detection by Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) that detect their presence via the MHC Class I (MHC-I) pathway. To reduce visibility of the designed proteins to this immune-system component, we develop a framework that uses the large language model (LLM) tuning method, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), to guide ProteinMPNN in minimizing the number of predicted MHC-I epitopes in its designs. Our goal is to design proteins with low MHC-I immune-visibility while preserving the original structure and function. For our assessment, we first use AlphaFold to predict the 3D structures of designed protein sequences. We then use TM-score, that measures the structural alignment between the predicted design and original protein, to evaluate fidelity to the original protein structure. We find our LLM-based tuning method for constraining MHC-I visibility is able to effectively reduce visibility without compromising structural similarity to the original protein.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

However, after accounting for known critical confounds, there is currently scant evidence for these hypothesised effects from studies recording electrophysiological neural activity. To provide a strong test for expectation effects on stimulus-evoked responses in visual cortex, we performed a probabilistic cueing experiment while recording electroencephalographic (EEG) data.

Two actionable variants in these genes have reached much higher frequencies than in cosmopolitan UK populations. Here, we report a BRCA2 splice acceptor variant, c.517-2A>G, found in breast and ovarian cancer families from Shetland. We investigated the frequency and origin of this variant in a population-based research cohort of people of Shetland ancestry, VIKING I. The variant segregates with female breast and ovarian cancer in diagnosed cases and is classified as pathogenic. Exome sequence data from 2,108 participants with three or more Shetlandic grandparents in VIKING I was used to estimate the population prevalence of c.517-2A>G in Shetlanders. Nine VIKING I research volunteers carry this variant, on a shared haplotype (carrier frequency 0.4%). This frequency is [~]130-fold higher than in UK Biobank, where the small group of carriers has a different haplotype. Records of birth, marriage and death indicate genealogical linkage of VIKING I carriers to a founder from the Isle of Whalsay, Shetland, similar to our observations for the BRCA1 founder variant from Westray, Orkney. In total, 93.5% of pathogenic BRCA variant carriers in Northern Isles exomes are accounted for by these two drifted variants. We thus provide the scientific evidence of an opportunity for screening people of Orcadian and Shetlandic origins for each drifted pathogenic variant, particularly women with Westray or Whalsay ancestry.","NA","medrxiv",1717884277839

We use live observation of wound closure in larval zebrafish after inflicting a stab wound to the brain. We demonstrate that the wound closes in the first 24 hours after injury by global tissue contraction. Microglia accumulation at the point of tissue convergence precedes wound closure and computational modelling of this process indicates that physical traction by microglia could lead to wound closure. Indeed, genetically or pharmacologically depleting microglia leads to defective tissue repair. Live observations indicate centripetal deformation of astrocytic processes contacted by migrating microglia. Severing such contacts leads to retraction of cellular processes, indicating tension. Weakening tension by disrupting the F-Actin stabilising gene lcp1 in microglial cells, leads to failure of wound closure. Therefore, we propose a previously unidentified mechanism of brain repair in which microglia has an essential role in contracting spared tissue.

We have previously demonstrated that signalling endosomes are transported in vivo at comparable speeds across motor neurons (MNs) innervating different hindlimb muscles, as well as between forelimb and hindlimb peripheral nerves. In contrast, axonal transport is faster in MNs compared to sensory neurons innervating the same muscle. Found periodically across the myelin sheath, Nodes of Ranvier (NoR) are short uncovered axonal domains that facilitate action potential propagation. Currently, it remains unresolved how the distinct molecular structures of the NoR impact axonal transport dynamics. Here, using intravital time-lapse microscopy of sciatic nerves in live, anaesthetised mice, we assessed diverse organelle dynamics at the NoR. We first observed that axonal morphologies were similar between fast and slow MNs, and found that signalling endosomes and mitochondria accumulate on the distal side of the NoR in both motor neuron subtypes. Assessment of axonal transport of signalling endosomes and mitochondria revealed a decrease in velocity and increase in pausing as the organelles transit through the NoR, followed by an increase in speed in the adjacent intranodal region. Collectively, this study has established axonal transport dynamics of two independent organelles at the NoR in vivo, and has relevance for several pathologies affecting peripheral nerves and the NoR, such as peripheral neuropathy, motor neuron diseases, and/or multiple sclerosis.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

The common coqui frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui, is a highly successful invader in Hawaii. We build on previous research characterizing changes in physiology and morphology to explore behavioral variation across the invasive range of coqui in Hawaii. We hypothesized that behavioral traits contributing to invasion expansion would be reflected in behavioral differences at the invasive center versus invasive edge. To investigate whether differences in the field represent local adaptation or behavioral plasticity, we additionally evaluated behavior following acclimation to a shared laboratory environment. While we identified only subtle behavioral variation among populations in the field, we found that individuals from all populations became less bold, active, and exploratory in the laboratory, converging on a similar behavioral phenotype. Alongside previous work, our results suggest that coqui adjust their behavior to local environmental conditions across their invasive range, and that behavioral flexibility may contribute to invasive success.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Here, we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can accurately identify genes likely to be causal at loci from GWAS. By evaluating the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on datasets of GWAS loci with high-confidence causal gene annotations, we show that these models outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying putative causal genes.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1717884277839

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models.

The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic.

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1717884277839

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. The comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar across sex, age (65-74/[&ge;]75 years), number of previous covid-19 vaccine doses received, and seasonal influenza vaccination co-administration subgroups and periods of either omicron XBB- or BA.2.86-sublineage dominance. While the protection was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, it was well-preserved at end of week 12 of follow-up.

ConclusionAmong adults aged [&ge;]65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine reduced the rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death during autumn and winter 2023-2024 across three Nordic countries.","NA","medrxiv",1717884277839

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717884277839

Recently, H5 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have caused large outbreaks in avian and multiple non-human mammalian species1,2. Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera3-6. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning7 to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind 2-6-linked sialic acids, and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine strains. Overall, the systematic nature of deep mutational scanning combined with the safety of pseudoviruses enables comprehensive measurements of the phenotypic effects of mutations that can inform real-time interpretation of viral variation observed during surveillance of H5 influenza.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1717884277839
