Hodarchaeales (Asgardarchaeota class Heimdallarchaeia) were recently shown to be the closest relatives of eukaryotes. However, limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution, including their anticipated role in eukaryogenesis. Here, we nearly double the number of Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to 869, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia (49 Hodarchaeales) and several novel lineages. Examining global distribution revealed Hodarcheales are primarily found in coastal marine sediments. Detailed analysis of their metabolic capabilities revealed guilds of Heimdallarchaeia are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmarks of aerobic eukaryotes, including electron transport chain complexes (III and IV), biosynthesis of heme, and response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The predicted structural architecture of Heimdallarchaeia membrane-bound hydrogenases includes additional Complex-I-like subunits potentially increasing the proton motive force and ATP synthesis. Heimdallarchaeia genomes encode CoxD, which regulates the electron transport chain (ETC) in eukaryotes. Thus, key hallmarks for aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. Moreover, we found that Heimdallarchaeia is present in a variety of oxic marine environments. This expanded diversity reveals these Archaea likely conferred energetic advantages during early stages of eukaryogenesis, fueling cellular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

This study investigates, in offspring mice, the effect of maternal COVID-19 vaccination on postnatal physical development, behavior and neurogenesis. After inoculation with inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell) at gestational day 14.5, antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were detected in serum of both dams and pups. At one month of age, pups born to vaccinated dams, but not the offspring of non-vaccinated dams, exhibited greater working memory and more neural cell proliferation, neuroblast formation, neuronal stem cell activity and larger numbers of mature neurons within the dentate gyrus (DG). Luminex multiplex assay revealed elevated levels of hippocampal cytokines/chemokines critical to neurogenesis and memory function, namely interferon-{gamma} [IFN-{gamma}] and CX3C motif chemokine ligand 1 [CX3CL1]. Conditional knockout technology implicated microglial IFN-{gamma} receptor 1 (IFN{gamma}R1) and CX3C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) as crucial intercellular participants in the neuronal developmental process, via regulating microglial activation and chemotaxis, respectively. We propose that, rather than posing risk for neurodevelopmental abnormalities, maternal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination transiently enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and working memory in offspring.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

We observed history-dependent spike back-propagation in distal dendrites, driven by locally generated Na+ spikes (dSpikes). Dendritic depolarization created a transient window for dSpike propagation, opened by A-type KV channel inactivation, and closed by slow NaV inactivation. Collisions of dSpikes with synaptic inputs triggered calcium channel and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent plateau potentials, with accompanying complex spikes at the soma.

Mobile integrons spread antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria, while the sedentary chromosomal integrons contain up to hundreds of cassettes of unknown function. Here, we show that many of these cassettes encode anti-phage defence systems. We found numerous streamlined variants of known systems, which have presumably evolved to fit the small size constraints of integron cassettes recombination and genesis. Intrigued by the rarity of known systems in the sedentary chromosomal integron of the Vibrio cholerae 7th cholera pandemic strain, we tested the presence of anti-phage functions in all its cassettes of unknown function. We found that at least 16 of the strain cassettes have an anti-phage activity in V. cholerae or E. coli. This represents 18% of the tested cassettes and almost 10% of all the integron cassettes, providing at long last a key adaptive role for a significant fraction of the sedentary integrons. Most of the newly discovered systems have little or no similarity to previously known ones and our experiments show that several mediate defence through cell lysis or growth arrest. One of these systems encodes a 64 amino acids protein, which represents the smallest known protein providing autonomous phage resistance. Given the thousands of uncharacterized integron cassette families, integrons could represent an untapped treasure trove of streamlined anti-phage systems.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Although nucleolar associated domains (NADs) have been recently mapped, the mechanisms of NAD association with nucleoli and the functional significance of their localization remain unclear. Here, we show that NAD association with nucleoli is mediated by nucleophosmin (NPM1), a factor located within the granular component, the outer layer of the nucleolus. NPM1 binds NADs, interacts with the histone lysine methyltransferase G9a (EHMT2), and is required for establishing H3K9me2 at NADs. Loss of NPM1 or expression of NPM1 mutant lacking the DNA binding domain (NPM1{Delta}DBD) caused NAD dissociation from nucleoli and H3K9me2 reduction specifically at NADs. G9a is dispensable for NAD contacts with nucleoli and interacts with NPM1{Delta}DBD, indicating that NADs acquire G9a-mediated H3K9me2 only after associating with NPM1 at nucleoli. The results provide mechanistic insights into how genomic domains associate with nucleoli and acquire their repressive chromatin state. Additionally, our findings suggest that the nucleolus not only serves as a scaffold for positioning repressive chromatin domains but also plays a direct role in establishing these chromatin states.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Mobile Integrons (MI) are borne on plasmids, acting as a vehicle for hundreds of antimicrobial resistance genes among key pathogens. These elements also carry gene cassettes of unknown function (gcus) whose role and adaptive value remains unexplored. Recent years have witnessed the discovery of a myriad defence systems against bacteriophages, highlighting that viral infection is a major selective pressure for bacteria. We hence sought to explore if gcus could encode phage defence systems. Using the INTEGRALL database, we established a collection of 129 gcus in pMBA, a vector where cassettes are established as part of a class 1 integron. PADLOC and DefenseFinder predicted four phage defence systems in this collection, comprising Lamassu, CBASS and two ABI (abortive infection) systems. We experimentally challenged all cassettes with phages and found nine additional candidates that were not detected in silico. We have characterized in depth the 13 gcus against a panel of phages in Escherichia coli confirming their role as phage defence integron cassettes (PICs). We used recombination assays to verify that all systems are bona fide integron cassettes and are therefore mobile. We show that pics confer resistance in other clinically relevant species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several PICs also limit prophage activation, providing protection at the population-level. Given the stockpiling capacity of integrons, we explored the additivity of phenotypes and found that integrons with two PICs confer multiphage-resistance. Additionally, when combined with antimicrobial resistance genes, integrons confer simultaneously drug and phage resistance. Crucially, we also show that the position of a PIC in the array can strongly decrease its cost. Our results prove a role of integrons in phage defence, acting as highly mobile, low-cost defence islands. This has important implications in the spread of defence systems, and on the future of phage therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

However, the microbial communities associated within these stems (the  caulosphere) and their contribution to biogeochemical cycling of methane and other compounds remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal that specialised microbial communities inhabit the bark of multiple Australian tree species and actively mediate the cycling of methane, hydrogen, and other climate-active trace gases. Based on genome-resolved metagenomics, most bark-associated bacteria are hydrogen metabolisers and facultative fermenters, adapted to dynamic redox and substrate conditions. Over three quarters of assembled genomes encoded genes for hydrogen metabolism, including novel lineages of Acidobacteriota, Verrucomicrobiota, and the candidate phylum JAJYCY01. Methanotrophs such as Methylomonas were abundant in certain trees and coexisted with hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Methanobacterium. Bark-associated microorganisms mediated aerobic oxidation of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane at concentrations seen in planta, but under anoxic conditions barks could become a significant source of these gases. Field-based experiments and upscaling analysis suggested that bark communities are quantitatively significant mediators of global biogeochemical cycling, mitigating climatically-active gas emissions from stems and contributing to the net terrestrial sink of atmospheric hydrogen.

Currently, phage therapy applications span personalised treatments that are tailored for a given patients infection, through to the use of pre-established cocktails of virulent phages against clinically relevant pathogens. However, both approaches face challenges, with personalised phage therapy being time-consuming and requiring a phage match to a patients infection, while phage cocktails may not be effective against a patients specific strain. The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia has reported an ongoing outbreak of infections by the Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC), a group of emerging multidrug-resistant pathogens responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. Utilising the hospitals strain collection, built over the last decade, we established an initial three-phage product with 54% ECC coverage that effectively reduced bacterial loads (>99%) in septicaemic mice. We then iteratively improved this product by enhancing phage killing efficiency using phage training and expanded host range through targeted phage isolation against low-coverage ECC strains. This iterative optimisation led to the creation of the product Entelli-02, containing five well characterised virulent phages that target clinical ECC strains through distinct bacterial cell surface receptors. Importantly, Entelli-02 exhibits broad host coverage (99%) and efficacy (92%) against The Alfred Hospitals ECC strain collection (n = 156). We produced this as a therapeutic-grade product, verified and endotoxin unit compliant, ready for use. This approach integrated academic phage research with clinical insights to produce the phage product Entelli-02 as an institution-specific phage cocktail with frontline efficacy and on-demand availability.

Here, using physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered mouse models and primary cells7,8, we demonstrate aging suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by aging-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, leading to a functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1--lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescue stemness and promote tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1-- lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells via induction of ferroptosis. We find that aging-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites associates with elevated NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells by inhibition of DNA methylation. We uncover that aging drives a functional iron insufficiency, which leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis, but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have significant implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate in young individuals, revealing a critical window for such cancer prevention efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

While Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is used extensively in research and biotechnology, it is a unicellular organism capable of only limited multicellular states. Here we expand the possibilities for engineering multicellular behaviours in yeast by developing modular toolkits for two key mechanisms seen in multicellularity, contact-dependent signalling and specific cell-to-cell adhesion. MARS (Mating-peptide Anchored Response System) is a toolkit based on surface-displayed fungal mating peptides and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling which can mimic juxtacrine signalling between yeasts. SATURN (Saccharomyces Adhesion Toolkit for multicellUlar patteRNing) surface displays adhesion-proteins pairs on yeasts and facilitates the creation of cell aggregation patterns. Together they can be used to create multicellular logic circuits, equivalent to developmental programs that lead to cell differentiation based on the local population. Using MARS and SATURN, we further developed JUPITER (JUxtacrine sensor for Protein-protein InTERaction), a genetic sensor for assaying protein-protein interactions in culture, demonstrating this as a tool to select for high affinity binders among a population of mutated nanobodies.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive due to their complexity and clinical heterogeneity of patients with DGBIs. We aimed to identify neuroimmune pathways that are critical in microbiota-gut-brain communication during de novo gut colonization.

MethodsWe employed a combination of gnotobiotic and state-of-the-art microbial tools, behavioral analysis, immune and pharmacological approaches. Germ-free wild type, MyD88-/- Ticam1-/- and SCID mice were studied before and after colonization with specific pathogen-free microbiota, Altered Schaedler Flora, E. coli or S. typhimurium (permanent or transient colonizers). TLR agonists and antagonists, CCR7 antagonist or immunomodulators were used to study immune pathways. We assessed brain c-Fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and dendritic and glial cells by immunofluorescence, expression of neuroimmune genes by NanoString and performed brain proteomics.

ResultsBacterial monocolonization, conventionalization or administration of microbial products to germ-free mice altered mouse behavior similarly, acting through Toll-like receptor or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain signaling. The process required CD11b+CD11c+CD103+ cell activation and migration into the brain. The change in behavior did not require the continued presence of bacteria and was associated with activation of multiple neuro-immune networks in the gut and the brain.

ConclusionsChanges in neural plasticity occur rapidly upon initial gut microbial colonization and involve innate immune signaling to the brain, mediated by CD11b+CD11c+CD103+ cell migration. The results identify a new target with therapeutic potential for DGBIs developing in context of increased gut and blood-brain barrier permeability.

Our models accurately predict synapse existence, degree profiles of individual neurons, and statistics of small network motifs. Importantly, these models require a surprisingly small number of neuronal cell types, which we infer and characterize. We further show that to replicate the experimentally-observed developmental path, multiple developmental epochs are necessary. Validation of our model's predictions of the synaptic connections using multiple reconstructions of adult worms suggests that our model identified the fundamental""backbone"" of the connectivity graph. The accuracy of the generative statistical models we use here offers a general framework for studying how connectomes develop and the underlying principles of their design.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Members of Brassicaceae family employ a lock and key mechanism involving stigmatic (sRALFs) and pollen RALFs (pRALFs) binding to FERONIA, a Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) receptor, to establish a prezygotic hybridization barrier. In the absence of compatible pRALFs, sRALFs bind to FERONIA, inducing a lock state for pollen tube penetration. Conversely, compatible pRALFs act as a key, facilitating successful fertilization. Competing pRALFs reduce the sRALFs binding to FERONIA in a dose-dependent manner, enabling pollen tube penetration. Despite its crucial role in Brassicaceae hybridization, the structural basis of this binding remains elusive owing to the highly flexible nature of RALF peptides.

Specific cellular-synaptic sources of inhibition in SPW-R remain unclear, as there are >60 types of GABAergic interneurons in CA1. Axo-axonic cells (AAC) are defined by their synaptic targeting of the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells, potently controlling spike output. The impact of AAC activity on SPW-R is controversial, due mainly to ambiguity of AAC identification. Here we monitored and manipulated opto-tagged AACs in behaving mice using silicon probe recordings. We found a large variability of AAC neurons, varying from enhanced to suppressed spiking during SPW-Rs, in contrast to the near-uniform excitation of other parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. AACs received convergent monosynaptic inputs from local pyramidal cell assemblies, which strongly influenced their participation in SPW-Rs. Optogenetic silencing of AACs increased power and duration of SPW-Rs, recruiting a greater number of PYR, suggesting AACs control SPW-R dynamics.

Although many competitive interactions have been characterized, molecular adaptations that can counter this antagonism and preserve or increase fitness remain underexplored. Here, we characterize the adaptation of Staphylococcus aureus to pyocyanin, a redox-active interspecies antimicrobial produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a co-infecting pathogen frequently isolated from wound and chronic lung infections with S. aureus. Using experimental evolution, we identified mutations in a conserved global transcriptional regulator, CodY, that confer tolerance to pyocyanin and thereby enhance survival of S. aureus. The transcriptional response of a pyocyanin tolerant CodY mutant to pyocyanin indicated a two-pronged defensive response compared to the wild type. Firstly, the CodY mutant strongly suppressed metabolism, by downregulating pathways associated with core metabolism, especially translation-associated genes, upon exposure to pyocyanin. Metabolic suppression via ATP depletion was sufficient to provide comparable protection against pyocyanin to the wild-type strain. Secondly, while both the wild-type and CodY mutant strains upregulated oxidative stress response pathways, the CodY mutant overexpressed multiple stress response genes compared to the wild type. We determined that catalase overexpression was critical to pyocyanin tolerance as its absence eliminated tolerance in the CodY mutant and overexpression of catalase was sufficient to impart tolerance to the wild-type strain. Together, these results suggest that both transcriptional responses likely contribute to pyocyanin tolerance in the CodY mutant. Our data thus provide new mechanistic insight into adaptation toward interbacterial antagonism via altered regulation that facilitates multifaceted protective cellular responses.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Genomic analysis can be used to trace transmission routes, supporting antimicrobial stewardship and informing infection control strategies. Here we used genomic analysis to track the movement and transmission of CREs within clinical and environmental samples. Methods: 25 isolates were cultured from clinical patient samples or swabs, that tested positive for OXA-48-like variants using the NG-Test CARBA-5 test and whole genome sequenced (WGS) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). 158 swabs and 52 wastewater samples were collected from the ward environment. 60 isolates (matching clinical isolate genera; Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Escherichia) were isolated from the environmental samples. Metagenomic sequencing was undertaken on 36 environmental wastewater and swab samples. Results: 21/25 (84%) clinical isolates had >1 blaOXA gene and 19/25 (76%) harboured >1 blaNDM gene. Enterobacterales were most commonly isolated from environmental wastewater samples 27/52 (51.9%), then stick swabs 5/43 (11.6%) and sponge swabs 5/115 (4.3%). 11/60 (18%) environmental isolates harboured at >1 blaOXA gene and 1.9% (1/60) harboured blaNDM-1. blaOXA genes were found in 2/36 (5.5%) metagenomic environmental samples. Discussion: Potential for putative patient-patient and patient-ward transmission was shown. ONT sequencing can expedite clinical decisions whilst awaiting reference laboratory results, providing economic and patient care benefits. Metagenomic sampling needs optimization to improve sensitivity.","NA","medrxiv",1720217314831

Condensates can be two- or multi-phase systems defined by coexisting dense and dilute phases. Here, we show that solution ions can partition asymmetrically across coexisting phases defined by condensates formed by intrinsically disordered proteins or homopolymeric RNA molecules. Our findings were enabled by direct measurements of the activities of cations and anions within coexisting phases of protein and RNA condensates. Asymmetries in ion partitioning between coexisting phases vary with protein sequence, condensate type, salt concentration, and ion type. The Donnan equilibrium set up by asymmetrical partitioning of solution ions generates interphase electric potentials known as Donnan and Nernst potentials. Our measurements show that the interphase potentials of condensates are of the same order of magnitude as membrane potentials of membrane-bound organelles. Interphase potentials quantify the degree to which microenvironments of coexisting phases are different from one another. Importantly, and based on condensate-specific interphase electric potentials, which are membrane-like potentials of membraneless bodies, we reason that condensates are mesoscale capacitors that store charge. Interphase potentials lead to electric double layers at condensate interfaces. This helps explain recent observations of condensate interfaces being electrochemically active.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Its activity is thus tightly controlled by a family of eukaryotic scaffolding proteins known as the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that confine PKA signaling to specific compartments in the cell. AKAP350 (the protein encoded by AKAP9) is a massive scaffolding protein that anchors PKA to the Golgi apparatus and the centrosome where it nucleates macromolecular signaling hubs that control microtubule nucleation and dynamics. Here, we have expressed and purified full-length AKAP350 from HEK293F cells in a functional conformation. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) of the purified protein revealed polydisperse particles forming fibrillar clusters around 50 nm in diameter, and long, thin filaments that reconstructed into double-stranded DNA. Tomographic reconstruction of a tilt series of the purified protein by electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) further elucidated these fibrillar clusters as 3D bundles of entangled filaments. Mass spectrometry and DNA sequencing confirmed the co-purification of DNA and DNA binding proteins such as nuclear factor 1 B (NFIB) and nucleolin (NCL). Pulldown of NFIB and NCL, but not of CEP290, CDK5RAP2, and CEP170 was diminished in the presence of DNase-I, suggesting that AKAP350 interaction with these two proteins is mediated by DNA. Overall, this study has achieved a quality purification of AKAP350 from which a previously uncharacterized interaction landscape with DNA and DNA binding proteins was discovered.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

As a mechanism of study, we use antisense RNAs (asRNAs). The asRNAs are expressed with the existing messenger RNA (mRNA) of a logic gate in a single transcript and target mRNAs of adjacent gates, creating a feedback of the protein-mediated repression that implements the core function of the logic gates. The extended transcripts then share a common sequestration reaction mediated by the cellular host's RNA metabolism. This sequestration consists of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation by asRNA and adjacent mRNA and subsequent degradation by the host. Numerical and stochastic analysis suggests that the feedback increases the steepness of the gate's transition region, reduces the leakage, and can potentially be used to adjust the transition location. To leverage these effects, we demonstrate how design parameters can be tuned to obtain desired dose-response curves and how arbitrary circuits can be assembled using the improved gates.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Novel approaches to control the spread of arboviruses focus on harnessing the antiviral immune system of their primary vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In arthropods, genes of the Vago family are often presented as analogs of mammalian cytokines with potential antiviral functions, but the role of Vago genes upon virus infection in Ae. aegypti is largely unknown. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the Vago gene family in Diptera, which led us to focus on a Vago-like gene that we named VLG-1. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we generated a VLG-1 mutant line of Ae. aegypti that revealed a proviral effect of this gene upon DENV and ZIKV infection. In the absence of VLG-1, virus dissemination throughout the mosquitos body was impaired, albeit not altering virus transmission rates. A tissue-specific transcriptome analysis revealed that the loss of VLG-1 impacted numerous biological processes potentially linked to viral replication, such as the oxidative stress response. Our results challenge the conventional understanding of Vago-like genes as antiviral factors and underscores the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying mosquito-arbovirus interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Characterizing DAD pathophysiology across disease progression is of ultimate importance to better understand the molecular and cellular features driving different DAD patterns and to optimize treatment strategies. To contextualize the interplay between cell types and assess their distribution, spatial transcriptomics (ST) techniques have emerged allowing unprecedented resolution to investigate spatial architecture of tissues. To this end, post-mortem lung tissue provides valuable insights into cellular composition and their spatial relationships at the time of death. Here, we have leveraged VisumST technology in post-mortem COVID-19 induced acute and proliferative DAD lungs including control samples with normal morphological appearance to unravel the immunopathological mechanisms underlying DAD providing novel insights into cellular and molecular communication events driving DAD progression in fatal COVID-19. We report a progressive loss of endothelial cell types, pneumocytes type I and natural killer cells coupled with a continuous increase of myeloid and stromal cells, mostly peribronchial fibroblasts, over disease progression. Spatial organization analysis identified variable cellular compartments, ranging from major compartments defined by cell type lineages in control lungs to increased and more specific compartmentalization including immune-specific clusters across DAD spectrum. Importantly, spatially informed ligand-receptor interaction (LRI) analysis revealed an intercellular communication signature defining COVID-19 induced DAD lungs. Transcription factor (TF) activity enrichment analysis identified TGF-B pathway as DAD driver, highlighting SMAD3 and SMAD7 TFs activity role during lung fibrosis. Integration of deregulated LRIs and TFs activity, allowed us to propose a downstream intracellular signaling pathway in peribronchial fibroblasts, suggesting potential novel therapeutic targets. Finally, spatio-temporal trajectories analysis provided insights into the alveolar epithelium regeneration program, characterizing markers of pneumocytes type II differentiation towards pneumocytes type I. In conclusion, we provide a spatial characterization of lung tissue architecture upon COVID-19 induced DAD progression, identifying molecular and cellular hallmarks that may help optimize treatment and patient management.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Yet, redundancy can be highly adaptive and is therefore a critical motif in circuit organization. The NAc, a highly integrative brain region controlling motivated behavior, is thought to receive distinct information from its various glutamatergic inputs yet strong evidence of functional specialization of inputs is lacking. Using dual-site fiber photometry in an operant reward task, we simultaneously recorded from two NAc glutamatergic afferents to assess circuit specialization. We identify a common neural motif that integrates reward history in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHip) inputs to NAc. Then, by systematically dissociating reward from choice and action, we identify key circuit-specificity in the behavioral conditions that recruit encoding. While mPFC-NAc invariantly encodes reward, vHip-NAc encoding requires goal-directed action and uncertainty. Ultimately, using optogenetic stimulation we demonstrate that both inputs co-operatively modulate task engagement. Taken together, we illustrate how similar encoding, with differential gating by behavioral state, supports outcome encoding to tune engagement to recent history of reward.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

This vaccine elicits robust antibody titers in BALB/c mice as measured by MERS-CoV pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays. Immunization of non-human primates (NHPs) with a single dose of Alhydrogel-adjuvanted vaccine elicits >103 geometric mean titer (GMT) of pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies that can be boosted with a second dose. These antibody levels are durable, with GMTs that surpass the post-prime levels for more than 5 months post-boost. Importantly, sera from these NHPs exhibits broad cross-reactivity against lentiviruses pseudotyped with spike proteins from MERS-CoV clades A, B, and C as well as a more distant pangolin merbecovirus.

Kinetic models of metabolism play a critical role in integrating omics data, as they provide explicit connections between metabolite concentrations, metabolic fluxes, and enzyme levels. Nevertheless, the challenges associated with determining the kinetic parameters that underlie cellular physiology pose significant obstacles to the broader acceptance and adoption of these models within the research community. Here, we present RENAISSANCE, a generative machine learning framework for efficiently parameterizing large-scale kinetic models with dynamic properties matching experimental observations.

Moreover, we show that RENAISSANCE successfully estimates missing kinetic parameters and reconciles them with sparse and noisy experimental data, resulting in a substantial reduction in parameter uncertainty and a notable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of the parameter estimates.

One approach to identifying functional areas and networks within individual brains is based on robust and extensively validated  localizer paradigms--contrasts of conditions that aim to isolate some mental process of interest. Here, we present a new version of a localizer for the fronto-temporal language-selective network. This localizer is similar to a commonly-used localizer based on the reading of sentences and nonword sequences (Fedorenko et al., 2010) but uses speeded presentation (200ms per word/nonword). Based on a direct comparison between the standard version (450ms per word/nonword) and the speeded versions of the language localizer in 24 participants, we show that a single run of the speeded localizer (3.5 min) is highly effective at identifying the language-selective areas: indeed, it is more effective than the standard localizer given that it leads to an increased response to the critical (sentence) condition and a decreased response to the control (nonwords) condition. This localizer may therefore become the version of choice for identifying the language network in neurotypical adults or special populations (as long as they are proficient readers), especially when time is of essence.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Among the diverse proteins secreted by the nematode, we were specifically interested in identifying proteases to pursue our goal of engineering decoy substrates that elicit an immune response when cleaved by an SCN protease. We identified a cysteine protease that we named Cysteine Protease 1 (CPR1), which was predicted to be a secreted effector based on transcriptomic data obtained from SCN esophageal gland cells, presence of a signal peptide, and lack of transmembrane domains. CPR1 is conserved in all isolates of SCN sequenced to date, suggesting it is critical for virulence. Transient expression of CPR1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves suppressed cell death induced by a constitutively active nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat protein, RPS5, indicating that CPR1 inhibits effector-triggered immunity. CPR1 localizes in part to the mitochondria when expressed in planta. Proximity-based labeling in transgenic soybean roots, co-immunoprecipitation, and cleavage assays identified a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase from soybean (GmBCAT1) as a substrate of CPR1. Silencing of the CPR1 transcript in the nematode reduced penetration frequency in soybean roots while the expression of CPR1 in soybean roots enhanced susceptibility. Our data demonstrates that CPR1 is a conserved effector protease with a direct target in soybean roots, highlighting it as a promising candidate for decoy engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Neural replay of task representations is a candidate mechanism by which the brain learns such relational information or samples from a learned model in the service of adaptive behavior. Here, we tested whether cortical reactivation is related to learning higher-order sequential relationships without consciousness. Human participants viewed sequences of images that followed probabilistic transitions determined by ring-like graph structures. Behavioral modeling revealed that participants acquired multi-step transition knowledge through gradual updating of an internal successor representation (SR) model, although half of participants did not indicate conscious knowledge about the sequential task structure. To investigate neural replay, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns during brief 10 seconds pauses from the ongoing statistical learning task. We found evidence for backward sequential replay of multi-step sequences in visual cortical areas. These findings indicate that implicit learning of higher-order relationships establishes an internal SR-based map of the task, and is accompanied by cortical on-task replay.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

ASL data from multiple vendors were included in the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. However, the M0 images were missing in Siemens ASL data, prohibiting CBF quantification. Here, we utilized a generative diffusion model to impute the missing M0 and validated generated CBF data with acquired data from GE.

MethodsA conditional latent diffusion model was trained to generate the M0 image and validate it on an in-house dataset (N=55) based on image similarity metrics, accuracy of CBF quantification, and consistency with the physical model. This model was then applied to the ADNI dataset (Siemens: N=211) to impute the missing M0 for CBF calculation. We further compared the imputed data (Siemens) and acquired data (GE) regarding regional CBF differences by AD stages, their classification accuracy for AD prediction, and CBF trajectory slopes estimated by a mixed effect model.

ResultsThe trained diffusion model generated the M0 image with high fidelity (Structural similarity index, SSIM=0.924{+/-}0.019; peak signal-to-noise ratio, PSNR=33.348{+/-}1.831) and caused minimal bias in CBF values (mean difference in whole brain is 1.07{+/-}2.12ml/100g/min). Both generated and acquired CBF data showed similar differentiation patterns by AD stages, similar classification performance, and decreasing slopes with AD progression in specific AD-related regions. Generated CBF data also improved accuracy in classifying AD stages compared to qualitative perfusion data.

Interpretation/ConclusionThis study shows the potential of diffusion models for imputing missing modalities for large-scale studies of CBF variation with AD.","NA","medrxiv",1720217314831

Here, we combine bulk and single cell genomics of human somatic NF1 mutant, IDH-wildtype glioblastomas with functional genomic analysis of cell lines and mouse intracranial tumor models to identify molecular subgroups within NF1 mutant glioblastomas and mechanisms underlying MEK inhibitor response. Targeted DNA sequencing showed homozygous deletion of the cell cycle regulator CDKN2A/B is a poor prognostic marker in somatic NF1 mutant, but not NF1 wildtype, tumors. DNA methylation array profiling revealed three epigenetic groups highlighted by distinct clinical features, co-mutation patterns, and reference methylation classifier identities. Genome-wide CRISPRi screens in glioblastoma cells revealed cell cycle regulators are conserved mediators of cell growth while response to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib converges on Ras/RAF/MEK pathway activation. Repression of the RAF regulator SHOC2 sensitizes glioblastomas to selumetinib in vitro and in vivo in mouse intracranial glioblastoma models. Single cell RNA-sequencing of mouse intracranial glioblastomas treated with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib reveals distinct responses between mesenchymal-like (MES-like) and non MES-like subpopulations suggesting non-MES like cells are intrinsically resistant to MEK inhibition. Finally, single nuclear RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of human NF1 mutant, CDKN2A/B deleted glioblastomas reveals MES-like tumor cells are associated with selumetinib sensitivity signatures while non MES-like cells exhibit increased cell cycle progression and lack selumetinib sensitivity, further supporting the notion that MEK inhibition specifically targets MES-like tumor cell subpopulations. Taken together, our data underscores the heterogeneity between and within somatic NF1 mutant glioblastomas and delineates mechanisms of MEK inhibitor response across distinct tumor subpopulations, guiding the development of future therapeutic strategies that may synergize with MEK inhibition for NF1 mutant tumors.

The tumor suppressor NF1 is mutated in 15% of glioblastomas,1-3 the most common malignant brain tumor with poor outcomes and few effective treatments.4 NF1 is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates Ras, and thus, NF1 loss leads to induction of Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, driving tumorigenesis and comprising a targetable molecular cascade.5,6 Genomic analysis of glioblastoma demonstrates NF1 mutation is associated with a mesenchymal-like (MES-like) transcriptomic tumor cell subpopulation and altered tumor microenvironment.7,8 More broadly, DNA methylation analysis reveals multiple epigenetic subgroups with overlapping relationships to transcriptomic subtype and DNA alterations, underscoring the complex relationship between genetic drivers and molecular signatures.9 While the updated 2021 Central Nervous System WHO tumor classification incorporates an ever increasing amount of molecular criteria for diffuse astrocytic tumors,10 the existence and clinical significance of molecular subgroups within somatic NF1 mutant, IDH-wildtype glioblastomas based on genetic co-mutations, epigenetic profile, or transcriptomic signatures remain unclear.

Preclinical data support the utility of MEK inhibition in NF1 mutant gliomas,11,12 and the MEK inhibitor selumetinib is FDA approved for tumors arising in patients with syndromic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) harboring a germline NF1 mutation.13,14 In NF-1 associated gliomas, MEK inhibition demonstrates efficacy in a limited case series,15 and combined BRAF/MEK inhibition shows efficacy in BRAF p.V600E mutant gliomas,16 further supporting the translational potential of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK blockade within genetically defined glioma subtypes. Nevertheless, treatment resistance to molecular monotherapy remains a challenge,17-20 and the mechanisms underlying MEK inhibitor resistance in NF1 mutant glioma are unknown.

Here, we integrate targeted DNA sequencing, DNA methylation profiling, and single nuclear RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of human patient somatic NF1 mutant, IDH-wildtype glioblastomas with single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) screens, and pharmacologic studies in cell lines and mouse intracranial glioblastoma models to define molecular subgroups and functional mediators of MEK inhibitor response. Targeted DNA sequencing of NF1 mutant, IDH-wildtype glioblastomas (n=186 tumors) revealed CDKN2A/B deletion was associated with poor outcomes in NF1 mutant, but not NF1 wildtype, glioblastomas. DNA methylation profiling (n=129 tumors) demonstrated three epigenetic subgroups with distinct clinical features, co- mutation patterns across cell cycle genes, and reference methylation classifier identities.

Genome-wide CRISPRi screens in mouse SB28 and human GBM43 glioblastoma cells identified a conserved cell cycle gene network mediating cell growth, consistent with the clinical importance of additional hits affecting the cell cycle in human somatic NF1 mutant glioblastomas. Moreover, genome-wide mediators of selumetinib response converged upon two Ras pathway effectors mediating selumetinib sensitivity: BRAF and SHOC2. SHOC2 repression in glioblastoma cells significantly improved selumetinib response both in vitro and in intracranial allografts in vivo. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of mouse intracranial glioblastomas treated with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib revealed MES-like tumor cells correlated with CDKN2A retention and the CRISPRi screen selumetinib sensitivity signature, with selumetinib resistant cells displaying Ras pathway induction. In contrast, non-MES like tumor cells were CDKN2A deficient and lacked expression of the CRISPRi screen selumetinib sensitivity signature, with selumetinib resistant cells inducing a glial de-differentiation program. Finally, snRNA-seq of NF1 mutant, CDKN2A/B deleted, IDH-wildtype glioblastomas (n=9) showed non MES-like tumor cells exhibit increased cell cycle progression and were not associated with the CRISPRi screen selumetinib sensitivity signature. MES-like tumor cells within newly diagnosed, but not recurrent, tumors retained expression of the CRISPRi screen selumetinib sensitivity signature, suggesting resistance can arise both between and within specific transcriptomic glioblastoma cell tumor cell subpopulations. Taken together, our data identifies clinically important subgroups of NF1 mutant, IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and supports a model in which heterogeneity between tumors and within tumor cell subpopulations underlies MEK inhibitor response, supporting the need for additional synergistic therapeutic approaches beyond maximal Ras pathway blockade for NF1 mutant glioblastomas.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Here we demonstrate that the activity of nucleic-acid cleaving enzymes can be localised within DNA-based membrane-less compartments by sequestering the respective DNA or RNA substrates. Reaction-diffusion processes lead to complex nonequilibrium patterns, dependent on enzyme concentration. By arresting similar dynamic patterns, we spatially organise different substrates in concentric sub-compartments, which can be then selectively addressed by different enzymes, demonstrating spatial distribution of enzymatic activity. Besides advancing our ability to engineer advanced biomimetic functions in synthetic membrane-less organelles, our results may facilitate the deployment of DNA-based condensates as microbioreactors or platforms for the detection and quantitation of enzymes and nucleic acids.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

DesignNationwide sibling-controlled cohort study of adolescents.

SettingSweden.

Participants1 124 049 men of which 477 453 were full siblings, who underwent mandatory military conscription examinations between 1972 and 1995 at a mean age of 18.3 years.

Main outcome measuresHazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of overall cancer diagnosis and cancer mortality, and 14 site-specific cancers (diagnosis or death), as recorded in the Swedish National Patient Register or Cause of Death Register until 31 December 2023, modelled using flexible parametric regressions.

ResultsParticipants were followed until a median (maximum) age of 55.9 (73.5) years, during which 98 410 were diagnosed with cancer and 16 789 had a cancer-related death (41 293 and 6908 among full siblings respectively). The most common cancers were non-melanoma skin (27 105 diagnoses & 227 deaths) and prostate cancer (24 211 diagnoses & 869 deaths). In cohort analysis, those in the highest quartile of cardiorespiratory fitness had a higher risk of prostate (adjusted HR 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.16) and skin cancer (e.g., non-melanoma HR 1.44; 1.37 to 1.50) compared to those in the lowest quartile, which led to a higher risk of any type of cancer diagnosis (HR 1.08; 1.06 to 1.11). However, those in the highest quartile had a lower risk of cancer mortality (HR 0.71; 0.67 to 0.76). When comparing full siblings, and thereby controlling for all behavioural, environmental, and genetic factors they share, the excess risk of prostate (HR 1.01; 0.90 to 1.13) and skin cancer (e.g., non-melanoma HR 1.09; 0.99 to 1.20) attenuated to the null. In contrast, the lower risk of overall cancer mortality was still statistically significant after control for such shared confounders (HR 0.78; 0.68 to 0.89). For other site-specific cancers, the influence of such confounding tended to vary, but none showed the same excess risk as prostate and non-melanoma skin cancer.

ConclusionsThe association between high levels of adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness and excess risk of some cancers, such as prostate and non-melanoma skin cancer, appears to be fully explained by unobserved confounders shared between full siblings. However, the protective association with cancer mortality persists even after control for such confounding.

Summary boxWhat is already known on this topic O_LIAdolescent physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are considered important factors for the prevention of cancer based on evidence from observational studies.
C_LIO_LIObservational studies are, however, vulnerable to unobserved confounders and bias processes, including health-seeking behaviours and genetic and environmental confounders.
C_LIO_LIThese biases could explain why prior studies have found that high adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with higher risks of some cancers, typically low-mortality cancers such as prostate and non-melanoma skin cancer.
C_LI What this study adds O_LIThis nationwide cohort study of 1.1 million male adolescents showed that while higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with excess risk of the most common cancers - prostate and non-melanoma skin - these associations attenuated to the null when accounting for behavioural, environmental, and genetic confounders shared between full siblings.
C_LIO_LIIn contrast, high adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with a lower risk of overall cancer mortality, which remained after controlling for unobserved confounders shared between full siblings.

Given that whole-body regeneration shares the same end-point - formation of a functional body plan - as embryonic development, it has been proposed that regeneration likely recapitulates developmental processes to some extent. Therefore, understanding how developmental processes are reactivated during regeneration is important for uncovering the evolutionary history of regeneration. Comparative transcriptomic studies in some species have revealed shared gene expression between development and regeneration, but it is not known whether these shared expression profiles correspond to shared functions, and which mechanisms activate expression of developmental genes during regeneration. We sought to address these questions using the acoel Hofstenia miamia, which is amenable to studies of both embryonic development and whole-body regeneration. By examining functionally validated regeneration processes during development at single-cell resolution, we found that whereas patterning and cellular differentiation are largely similar, wound response programs have distinct dynamics between development and regeneration. Chromatin accessibility analyses revealed that regardless of playing concordant or divergent roles during regeneration and development, genes expressed in both processes are frequently controlled by the same regulatory regions, potentially via utilization of distinct transcription factor binding sites. This study extends the known correspondence of development and regeneration from broad transcriptomic similarity to include patterning and differentiation processes. Further, our work provides a catalog of regulatory regions and binding sites that potentially regulate developmental genes during regeneration, fueling comparative studies of regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Several members of the Lactobacillaceae (LAB) family are frequently isolated from the floral niche, mostly from bees and flowers. In some floral LAB species (henceforth referred to as bee- associated), distinctive genomic (e.g., genome reduction) and phenotypic (e.g., preference for fructose over glucose or fructophily) features were recently documented. These features are found across distantly related species, raising the hypothesis that specific genomic and phenotypic traits evolved convergently during adaptation to the floral environment.

To test this hypothesis, we examined representative genomes of 369 species of bee-associated and non-bee-associated LAB. Phylogenomic analysis unveiled seven independent ecological shifts towards the floral niche in LAB. In these bee-associated LAB, we observed pervasive, significant reductions of genome size, gene repertoire, and GC content.

Using machine leaning, we could distinguish bee-associated from non-bee-associated species with 94% accuracy, based on the absence of genes involved in metabolism, osmotic stress, or DNA repair. Moreover, we found that the most important genes for the machine learning classifier were seemingly lost, independently, in multiple bee-associated lineages. One of these genes, adhE, encodes a bifunctional aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase associated with the evolution of fructophily, a rare phenotypic trait that was recently identified in many floral LAB species. These results suggest that the independent evolution of distinctive phenotypes in bee- associated LAB has been largely driven by independent loss of the same set of genes.

ImportanceSeveral lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species are intimately associated with bees and exhibit unique biochemical properties with potential for food applications and honeybee health. Using a machine-learning based approach, our study shows that adaptation of LAB to the bee environment was accompanied by a distinctive genomic trajectory deeply shaped by gene loss. Several of these gene losses occurred independently in distantly related species and are linked to some of their unique biotechnologically relevant traits, such as the preference of fructose over glucose (fructophily). This study underscores the potential of machine learning in identifying fingerprints of adaptation and detecting instances of convergent evolution. Furthermore, it sheds light onto the genomic and phenotypic particularities of bee-associated bacteria, thereby deepening the understanding of their positive impact on honeybee health.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

They are associated with high carer distress and poor patient outcomes. There are limited treatment options and progress has been hindered by a lack of appropriate outcome measures. This study aimed to develop a carer-rated questionnaire oriented to people with syndromes associated with FTLD.

MethodologyPrincipal component and Rasch analysis were conducted on carer-, clinician- and patient-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests of behavioural change in the ""Picks Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Prevalence and Incidence"" (PiPPIN) study. We identified two key components which informed subsequent item development for a novel scale which we call the Cambridge Questionnaire for Apathy and Impulsivity Traits (CamQUAIT). The resulting scale comprised two subscales assessing ""motivation and support"" (CamQUAIT-M) and ""impulsivity and challenging behaviours"" (CamQUAIT-C). An independent sample of 132 carers for people with FTLD-associated syndromes completed the CamQUAIT, along with a battery of existing measures. The CamQUAIT was reduced to 15 items following Rasch analysis.

ResultsBoth subscales showed good construct validity as assessed by high Person separation index (CamQUAIT-M=0.9; CamQUAIT-C=0.7) and Cronbachs alpha (CamQUAIT-M=0.9; CamQUAIT-C=0.8). The subscales correlated moderately with each other (r=0.376, p<0.001), and with existing measures of behavioural change.

ConclusionThe CamQUAIT is a targeted measurement tool to assess apathy, impulsivity, and related behavioural change in the context of FTLD-related syndromes. The scale demonstrates good measurement properties and is sensitive to group differences, providing a suitable outcome measure to evaluate novel symptomatic treatments.","NA","medrxiv",1720217314831

During aging, alterations in lipid metabolism lead to reduced content of very long-chain PUFAs (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina, and this decline is associated with normal age-related visual decline and pathological age-related macular degeneration (AMD). ELOVL2 (Elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids-like 2) encodes a transmembrane protein that produces precursors to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and VLC-PUFAs, and methylation level of its promoter is currently the best predictor of chronological age.

Current methods for predicting and diagnosing tumor metastasis rely heavily on extensive examinations and subjective clinical judgments, introducing considerable uncertainty and inefficiency. Accurate prediction of tumor metastasis likelihood is crucial for guiding effective clinical interventions and extending patient survival. Additionally, identifying key genes that influence metastasis probability could provide valuable data for detecting tumor-specific biomarkers indicative of metastasis likelihood.

MethodsMulti-omics datasets, which encompass diverse genomic information, offer a comprehensive understanding of cancer biology. Leveraging deep learning algorithms enhances the accuracy and predictive power in forecasting cancer metastasis, given their superior performance in complex prediction tasks. We developed a deep learning-based framework, MetaGXplore, which represents the first attempt to predict metastasis probability using pan-cancer multi-omic datasets and to explain the pivotal genes involved in the process.

ConclusionsWe trained the classification model using a K-fold cross-validation procedure and interpreted the predicted results with GNNExplainer.

Using whole animal screens in genetically engineered mouse models of cancer we have identified circulating metabolites associated with metastasis. Specifically, we highlight the pyrimidine uracil as a prominent metastasis-associated metabolite. Uracil is generated by neutrophils expressing the enzyme uridine phosphorylase-1 (UPP1), and neutrophil specific Upp1 expression is increased in cancer. Altered UPP1 activity influences expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of neutrophils, leading to decreased neutrophil motility in the pre-metastatic lung. Furthermore, we find that UPP1-expressing neutrophils suppress T-cell proliferation, and the UPP1 product uracil can increase fibronectin deposition in the extracellular microenvironment. Consistently, knockout or inhibition of UPP1 in mice with mammary tumours increases the number of T-cells and reduces fibronectin content in the lung and decreases the proportion of mice that develop lung metastasis. These data indicate that UPP1 influences neutrophil behaviour and extracellular matrix deposition in the lung and suggest that pharmacological targeting of this pathway could be an effective strategy to reduce metastasis.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Cell walls are highly dynamic structures that act both as a structural material and as a hub for a wide range of signaling processes. Despite its crucial role in all aspects of the plant life cycle, live dynamical imaging of the cell wall and its functional properties has remained challenging. Here, we introduce CarboTag, a modular toolbox for live functional imaging of plant walls. CarboTag relies on a small molecular motif, a pyridine boronic acid, that targets its cargo to the cell wall, is non-toxic and ensures rapid tissue permeation. We designed a suite of cell wall imaging probes based on CarboTag in any desired color for multiplexing. Moreover, we created new functional reporters for live quantitative imaging of key cell wall features: network porosity, cell wall pH and the presence of reactive oxygen species. CarboTag opens the way to dynamical and quantitative mapping of cell wall responses at subcellular resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

However, this performance comes at the expense of simplicity because the ANN models typically have many hidden layers with many feature maps in each layer. Here we show that ANN models of V1 can be substantially simplified while retaining high predictive power. To demonstrate this, we first recorded a new dataset of over 29,000 neurons responding to up to 65,000 natural image presentations in mouse V1. We found that ANN models required only two convolutional layers for good performance, with a relatively small first layer. We further found that we could make the second layer small without loss of performance, by fitting a separate ""minimodel"" to each neuron. Similar simplifications applied for models of monkey V1 neurons. We show that these relatively simple models can nonetheless be useful for tasks such as object and visual texture recognition and we use the models to gain insight into how texture invariance arises in biological neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

It is unknown whether broad-spectrum RAS inhibitors meet similar limitations. Here, we identify and categorize mechanisms of resistance to the broad-spectrum active-state RAS inhibitor RMC-7977 in colorectal cancer cell lines. We found that KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer cell lines are universally sensitive to RMC-7977, inhibiting the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK axis, halting proliferation and in some cases inducing apoptosis. To monitor KRAS downstream effector pathway activity, we developed a compartment-specific dual-color ERK activity reporter system. RMC-7977 treatment reduced reporter activity. However, long-term dose escalation with RMC-7977 revealed multiple patterns of reporter reactivation in emerging resistant cell populations that correlated with phosphorylation states of compartment-specific ERK targets. Cells sorted for high, low, or cytoplasmic reporter activity exhibited distinct patterns of genomic mutations, phospho-protein, and transcriptional activities. Notably, all resistant subpopulations showed dynamic ERK regulation in the presence of the RAS inhibitor, unlike the parental sensitive cell lines. High levels of RAS downstream activities were observed in cells characterized by a KRAS Y71H resistance mutation. In contrast, RAS inhibitor-resistant populations with low, or cytoplasmic ERK reporter reactivation displayed different genetic alterations, among them RAF1 S257L and S259P mutations. Colorectal cancer cells resistant to RMC-7977 and harboring the RAF1 mutation specifically exhibited synergistic sensitivity to concurrent RAS and RAF inhibition. Our findings endorse reporter-assisted screening together with single-cell analyses as a powerful approach for dissecting the complex landscape of therapy resistance. The strategy offers opportunities to develop clinically relevant combinatorial treatments to counteract emergence of resistant cancer cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

Oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) are one of the key appetite-suppressing effectors within the melanocortin system. In this work, we report that metabolic stress in mice evokes spatiotemporally selective ATP release (Inflares) from PVH astrocytes, accompanied with the expression of hematopoietic lineage-specific ADP/ATP receptor P2Y12 on OXT (PVHOXT) neurons. Importantly, ""ectopic"" emergence of P2Y12 on OXT neurons of patients with diabetes mellitus suggests an evolutionary conserved purinergic response to metabolic stress. Strikingly, increased purinergic signaling leads to impaired responsiveness of PVHOXT neurons accompanied with hyperphagic obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, nasal administration of clinically approved doses of P2Y12 inhibitors counteracts diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice and spontaneous weight gain in monkeys, paving the way for their application in patients with metabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

NOWS comprises gastrointestinal, autonomic nervous system, and neurological dysfunction that manifest during spontaneous withdrawal. Current treatments involve non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, however, there is no one standardized approach, in part because of variability in NOWS severity. To effectively model NOWS traits in mice, we used a third trimester-approximate opioid exposure paradigm, where neonatal inbred FVB/NJ and outbred Carworth Farms White(CFW) pups were injected twice-daily with morphine(10-15mg/kg, s.c.) or saline(0.9%, 20 ul/g, s.c.) from postnatal day(P) one to P14. We observed reduced body weight gain, hypothermia, thermal hyperalgesia, and increased ultrasonic vocalizations(USVs). Neonatal USVs are emitted exclusively in isolation to communicate distress and thus serve as a model behavior for affective states. On P14, we observed altered USV syllable profiles during spontaneous morphine withdrawal, including an increase in Complex 3 syllables in FVB/NJ females(but not males) and in CFW mice of both sexes. Brainstem transcriptomics revealed an upregulation of the kappa opioid receptor(Oprk1), whose activation has previously been shown to contribute to withdrawal-induced dysphoria. Treatment with the kappa opioid receptor(KOR) antagonist, nor-BNI(30 mg/kg, s.c.), significantly reduced USV emission in FVB/NJ females, but not FVB/NJ males during spontaneous morphine withdrawal. Furthermore, treatment with the KOR agonist, U50,488h(0.625 mg/kg, s.c.), was sufficient to increase USV emission on P10(both sexes) and on P14(females only) in FVB/NJ mice. Together, these results indicate a female-specific recruitment of the dynorphin/KOR system in neonatal opioid withdrawal symptom severity.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314831

We demonstrate that selective inhibition of host cell NMT decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection by 90% in human lung and primary nasal epithelial cells, and choroid plexus-cortical neuron organoids. NMT inhibition does not affect viral entry, replication or release, but impairs the maturation and incorporation of viral envelope proteins into newly assembled virions, leading to compromised infectivity of released virions.

CircRNAs are involved in regulation of their cognate RNAs by increasing transcription rates, RNA stability and alternative splicing.

We sequenced light-grown and etiolated seedlings after 5 or 7 days post-germination and identified a total of 3,447 circRNAs from 2,763 genes. Most circRNAs originate from a single homeolog of the three subgenomes from allohexaploid camelina and correlates with higher ratios of alternative splicing of their cognate genes.

Gradients and mechanical forces often act as global cues that bias cell polarity and orientation, and polarity is coordinated by communication between adjacent cells.

Advances in fluorescence microscopy combined with deep learning algorithms for image segmentation open up a wealth of possibilities to understand cell polarity behaviour in health and disease. We have therefore developed the open-source package Polarity-JaM, which offers versatile methods for performing reproducible exploratory image analysis. Multi-channel single cell segmentation is performed using a flexible and userfriendly interface to state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. Interpretable single-cell features are automatically extracted, including cell and organelle orientation, cell-cell contact morphology, signaling molecule gradients, as well as collective orientation, tissue-wide size and shape variation. Circular statistics of cell polarity, including polarity indices, confidence intervals, and circular correlation analysis, can be computed using our web application. We have developed data graphs for comprehensive visualisation of key statistical measures and suggest the use of an adapted polarity index when the expected polarisation direction or the direction of a global cue is known a priori.

The focus of our analysis is on fluorescence image data from endothelial cells (ECs) and their polarisation behaviour. ECs line the inside of blood vessels and are essential for vessel formation and repair, as well as for various cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and inflammation. However, the general architecture of the software will allow it to be applied to other cell types and image modalities.

This deep homology is reflected in ESCRT-III structure and function as demonstrated by the fact that ESCRT-IIIB assembles into parallel arrays on planar membranes to initiate membrane deformation, and is required to recruit ESCRT-IIIA to generate composite polymers.

For short-read, high-throughput sequencing data, mapping sequencing reads to a linear reference genome can bias population genetic inference due to mismatches in reads carrying non-reference alleles. In this study, we investigate the impact of mapping bias on allele frequency estimates from pseudohaploid data, commonly used in ultra-low coverage ancient DNA sequencing. To mitigate mapping bias, we propose an empirical adjustment to genotype likelihoods. Simulating ancient DNA data with realistic post-mortem damage, we compare widely used methods for estimating ancestry proportions under different scenarios, including reference genome selection, population divergence, and sequencing depth. Our findings reveal that mapping bias can lead to differences in estimated admixture proportion of up to 4% depending on the reference population. However, the choice of method has a much stronger impact, with some methods showing differences of 10%. qpAdm appears to perform best at estimating simulated ancestry proportions, but it is sensitive to mapping bias and its applicability may vary across species due to its requirement for additional populations beyond the sources and target population. Our adjusted genotype likelihood approach largely mitigates the effect of mapping bias on genome-wide ancestry estimates from genotype likelihood-based tools. However, it cannot account for the bias introduced by the method itself or the noise in individual site allele frequency estimates due to low sequencing depth. Overall, our study provides valuable insights for obtaining precise estimates of allele frequencies and ancestry proportions in empirical studies.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

At overdose levels, opioid-induced respiratory depression becomes fatal without timely administration of the rescue drug naloxone. Currently, overdose survival relies entirely on bystander intervention, requiring a nearby person to discover and identify the overdosed individual, and have immediate access to naloxone to administer. Government efforts have focused on providing naloxone in abundance but do not address the equally critical component for overdose rescue: a willing and informed bystander. To address this unmet need, we developed the Naloximeter: a class of life-saving implantable devices that autonomously detect and treat overdose, with the ability to simultaneously contact first-responders. We present three Naloximeter platforms, for both fundamental research and clinical translation, all equipped with optical sensors, drug delivery mechanisms, and a supporting ecosystem of technology to counteract opioid-induced respiratory depression. In small and large animal studies, the Naloximeter rescues from otherwise fatal opioid overdose within minutes. This work introduces life-changing, clinically translatable technologies that broadly benefit a susceptible population recovering from opioid use disorder.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

TE invasions triggered by HT may be much more abundant than previously thought. For example, previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster found 11 TE invasions over 200 the past years. A major limitation of current approaches for detecting recent invasions is the necessity for a repeat-library, which is notoriously difficult to generate. To address this, we developed GenomeDelta, a novel approach for identifying sample-specific sequences, such as recently invading TEs, without prior knowledge of the sequence. It can thus be used with model and non-model organisms. As input, GenomeDelta requires a long-read assembly and short-read data. It will find sequences in the assembly that are not represented in the short read data. Beyond identifying recent TE invasions, GenomeDelta can detect sequences with spatially heterogeneous distributions, recent insertions of viral elements and recent lateral gene transfers. We thoroughly validated GenomeDelta with simulated and real data from extant and historical specimens. Finally, we demonstrate that GenomeDelta can reveal novel biological insights: we discovered the three most recent TE invasions in Drosophila melanogaster and a novel TE with a geographically heterogeneous distribution in Zymoseptoria tritici.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

Studying amphibian biology through the genomics lens increases our understanding of the features of this animal class and that of other terrestrial vertebrates. The need for amphibian genomics resources is more urgent than ever due to the increasing threats to this group. Amphibians are one of the most imperiled taxonomic groups, with approximately 41% of species threatened with extinction due to habitat loss, changes in land use patterns, disease, climate change, and their synergistic effects. Amphibian genomics resources have provided a better understanding of ontogenetic diversity, tissue regeneration, diverse life history and reproductive modes, anti- predator strategies, and resilience and adaptive responses. They also serve as critical models for understanding widespread genomic characteristics, including evolutionary genome expansions and contractions given they have the largest range in genome sizes of any animal taxon and multiple mechanisms of genetic sex determination. Despite these features, genome sequencing of amphibians has significantly lagged behind that of other vertebrates, primarily due to the challenges of assembling their large, repeat-rich genomes and the relative lack of societal support. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies, along with computational techniques that enhance scaffolding capabilities and streamline computational workload is now enabling the ability to overcome some of these challenges. To promote and accelerate the production and use of amphibian genomics research through international coordination and collaboration, we launched the Amphibian Genomics Consortium (AGC) in early 2023. This burgeoning community already has more than 282 members from 41 countries (6 in Africa, 131 in the Americas, 27 in Asia, 29 in Australasia, and 89 in Europe). The AGC aims to leverage the diverse capabilities of its members to advance genomic resources for amphibians and bridge the implementation gap between biologists, bioinformaticians, and conservation practitioners. Here we evaluate the state of the field of amphibian genomics, highlight previous studies, present challenges to overcome, and outline how the AGC can enable amphibian genomics research to ""leap"" to the next level.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

NLR homeostasis has to be tightly regulated to ensure proper defense without triggering autoimmunity. However, in contrast to singleton NLRs, the mechanisms controlling the paired NLRs complex homeostasis are less understood. The paired Arabidopsis RRS1/RPS4 immune receptor complex confers disease resistance through effector recognition mediated by the integrated WRKY domain of RRS1. Here, through proximity labelling, we reveal a ubiquitination-deubiquitination cycle that controls the homeostasis of the RRS1/RPS4 complex. E3 ligase RARE directly binds and ubiquitinates RRS1s WRKY domain to promote its proteasomal degradation, thereby destabilizing RPS4 indirectly and compromising the stability and function of the RRS1/RPS4 complex. Conversely, the deubiquitinating enzymes UBP12/UBP13 deubiquitinate RRS1s WRKY domain, counteracting RAREs effects. Interestingly, the abundance of WRKY transcription factors WRKY70 and WRKY41 is also regulated by RARE and UBP12/UBP13. Phylogenetic analysis suggests this regulation likely transferred from WRKY70/WRKY41 to RRS1 upon WRKY domain integration. Our findings improve our understanding of homeostatic regulation of paired NLR complex and uncover a new paradigm whereby domain integration can co-opt preexisting post-translational modification to regulate novel protein functions.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

While the PRC2 methyltransferase Curly leaf (CLF) is known to be specifically involved, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study sheds light on how TOR fine-tunes CLF protein levels by promoting translation re-initiation mediated by eIF3h. We found that the second upstream open reading frame (uORF) located in the 5 leader region of the CLF transcript significantly represses its translation (by 50%). Plants lacking this uORF leader displayed reduced sensitivity to TOR inhibition and impaired induction of stress-responsive genes. Interestingly, this uORF sequence exhibits partial conservation across diverse plant species, suggesting a potential role in adaptation to various environmental conditions. Our findings reveal a dynamic mechanism within the TOR-PRC2 pathway, highlighting its responsiveness to environmental stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

In our study, we aimed to develop an openly accessible reference of cytokines in the airways and blood of healthy children spanning 1 to 16 years of age. We examined how cytokine concentration changes during childhood and assessed whether a core set of cytokine markers could be used to indirectly evaluate the response of a broad spectrum of inflammatory analytes. To develop our reference, a total of 78 unique analytes were measured in cell-free bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and plasma from 78 children. We showed that age profoundly impacts soluble immune analyte concentration in both sample types and identified a highly correlative core set of 10 analytes in BAL and 11 analytes in plasma capable of indirectly evaluating the response of up to 34 inflammatory mediators.

Osteological, genetic, and isotopic study of these equid remains reveal the presence of at least one adult domestic donkey with mixed European and West African ancestry, possibly supplied through undocumented exchange during a trans-Atlantic stopover. These results reveal the importance of equids in the survival of early European settlers and the global connectivity of early trans-Atlantic exchange in horses and donkeys, showing Caribbean and African links in the founding livestock populations and pointing towards an important and ecologically-anchored role for donkeys in the early colonial lifeways along the Eastern seaboard.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

A central question in bacterial ecology is why some species engage in cooperative interactions, whereas others compete. But this question often neglects the role of the environment. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic networks from two different open-access collections (AGORA and CarveMe) to assess pairwise interactions of different microbes in varying environmental conditions (provision of different environmental compounds). By scanning thousands of environments for 10,000 pairs of bacteria from each collection, we found that most pairs were able to both compete and cooperate depending on the availability of environmental resources. This approach allowed us to determine commonalities between environments that could facilitate the potential for cooperation or competition between a pair of species. Namely, cooperative interactions, especially obligate, were most common in less diverse environments. Further, as compounds were removed from the environment, we found interactions tended to degrade towards obligacy. However, we also found that on average at least one compound could be removed from an environment to switch the interaction from competition to facultative cooperation or vice versa. Together our approach indicates a high degree of plasticity in microbial interactions to the availability of environmental resources.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1720217314832

However, to be included in national NCS inventories, governments must first quantify the kelp-derived carbon stocks and fluxes leading to carbon sequestration. Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface and to a new and highly relevant livestock species, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.","NA","biorxiv",1720217314832

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
