SINEs retain sequence features recognized by the POL III machinery and constitute a substantial portion of vertebrate genomes. Despite their impact on genome stability and evolution, the mechanisms governing SINE transcription remain poorly understood. Although DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation have been implicated in their repression, we find these pathways play only a minor role in mouse embryonic stem cells. Instead, we identify the ChAHP complex as a key repressor of SINE B2 elements. ChAHP directly inhibits POL III transcription by blocking TFIIIB recruitment without affecting TFIIIC binding. This selective interference prevents transcription initiation and highlights a distinct regulatory mechanism. Our findings establish ChAHP as a non-canonical repressor of POL III-dependent SINE transcription, offering new insights into the control of this pervasive class of non-coding genomic elements.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the ""Porto do Son"" cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1751580566050

DesignNationally-representative household survey, January-March 2025.

SettingGreat Britain.

Participants5,893 adults ([&ge;]18y).

Main outcome measuresParticipants were asked whether they had used medication in the past year to manage type 2 diabetes (excluding insulin), reduce the risk of heart disease, or support weight loss and, if so, whether they had used five specific GLP1-RAs. Those who had not used medication to support weight loss in the past year were asked how likely they would be to consider doing so in the next year. Estimates were reported stratified by participant characteristics and extrapolated to the national population.

ResultsOverall, 2.9% [2.4-3.4%] - [~]1.6 million adults - reported using a GLP-1RA to support weight loss in the past year, with 1.7% [1.4-2.1%] ([~]910,000 adults) using them exclusively for this purpose. The majority of those who used them exclusively for weight loss (91.4% [85.6-97.2%]) reported using GLP-1RAs that are licensed for this purpose in Great Britain, most commonly Mounjaro (tirzepatide; 80.2% [71.9-88.6%]). Of those who had not used weight-loss medication in the past year, 6.5% [5.7-7.3%] ([~]3.3 million adults) expressed an interest in doing so in the next year. Use and interest were more prevalent among women, people in mid-life, and those reporting past-month psychological distress. Interest was also higher among people facing greater socioeconomic disadvantage, including those in financial difficulty or unemployed due to long-term illness or disability.

ConclusionsIn the first quarter of 2025, 4.2 million adults in Great Britain - nearly one in ten - either had recently used a GLP-1RA to support weight loss or were interested in doing so in the near future. A substantial minority reported using a type of GLP-1RA that was not licensed for weight management, suggesting off-label use. Interest was particularly high among less advantaged socioeconomic groups, while use was similar across groups, highlighting the importance of addressing equity in access. These findings underscore the need to monitor who is accessing these medications and to ensure their safe, appropriate, and equitable provision.

However, their contents, functions, and evolutionary mechanisms remain unclear. We performed comparative genomics on long-read assembled GRCs from male House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), Common Rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus), and Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), the first two of which are newly presented and annotated here. These long-read GRCs are repeat-rich (63-74%), despite their wide variation in size (16-160 megabases), individually distinct gene content, and variable evolutionary histories. These GRCs have accumulated intact long terminal repeat (LTR) endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and their proliferation co-occurs with speciation events of passerine birds. In contrast, normal chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes) are known to purge ERVs through ectopic recombination of LTRs that generate solo LTRs. Furthermore, transcriptomic data reveal significantly higher ERV transcription on GRCs than on A-chrs in House Finch testis. We propose that GRCs act as reservoirs of active ERVs, promoting germline transposition and potentially accelerating adaptation and speciation. This study suggests that GRCs play an indispensable role and likely contribute to adaptive diversification in birds.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

The current focus on AI deployments in urban areas and the history of US urban-rural digital divides raises concerns that the promise of AI may not be realized in rural communities. This may exacerbate well-documented health disparities. Without the benefits of AI-driven improvements in patient outcomes and increased efficiency, rural healthcare facilities may fall farther behind their urban counterparts and rural hospital closure rates may continue to rise.

MethodsWe conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA guidelines. We included peer-reviewed, original research studies indexed in PubMed, Embase, and WebOfScience after January 1, 2010 and through April 29, 2025. Studies were required to discuss the development, implementation, or evaluation of AI tools in rural US healthcare, including frameworks that help facilitate AI development (e.g., data warehouses).

FindingsOur search strategy found 26 studies meeting inclusion criteria after full text screening with 14 papers discussing predictive AI models and 12 papers discussing data or research infrastructure. AI models most commonly targeted resource allocation and distribution. Few studies explored model deployment and impact. Half noted the lack of data and analytic resources as a limitation to both development and validation. None of the studies discussed examples of generative AI being trained, evaluated, or deployed in a rural setting.

InterpretationPractical limitations may be influencing and limiting the types of AI models evaluated in the rural US. We noted validation of tools in the rural US was underwhelming, and ultimately, neglected. With few studies moving beyond AI model design and development stages, there is a clear gap in our understanding of how to reliably validate, deploy, and sustain AI models in rural settings to advance health in all communities.

FundingNational Library of Medicine

Research in contextEvidence before this study: Clinical artificial intelligence (AI)--both for prediction modeling and generative tools-- tools promise to reduce care delays, improve diagnosis and treatment decision-making, reduce care costs, and improve efficiency to reduce provider workload and enhance practice management. Unfortunately, efforts to deploy artificial intelligence (AI)--both for prediction modeling and generative tools--in healthcare are advancing, primarily at large academic medical centers and in urban areas. An emerging new digital divide in the use of clinical AI could exacerbate the well-documented health disparities between urban and rural communities in the United States. A better understanding of if and how AI is being developed, deployed, and evaluated across rural US communities is necessary to identify resources gaps and challenges to broad AI use in all communities.

Added value of this study: This study analyzes the current state of artificial intelligence research in the rural United States. For predictive AI models, applications most commonly targeted resource allocation and distribution. We noted several attempts to predict resource utilization of patients who were either tested or tested positive to COVID-19. However, we noted few AI solutions for acute medical events faced by rural patients, such as trauma and stroke, despite worse outcomes for rural patients suffering from these acute events. The limited availability of time-critical specialties such as trauma/emergency medicine, neurology, and cardiology in rural areas often necessitates patients with such conditions be transferred to larger, more resourced hospitals. Practical limitations may be influencing and limiting the types of AI models evaluated in rural US medical facilities. The most frequent model employed were tree-based ensembles, such as random forests and gradient-boosting trees. Our review also highlighted few studies of AI models moving beyond the design and develop stages, leaving a clear gap in our understanding of how to deploy and sustain predictive AI models in rural settings. Several challenges noted in the reviewed studies may provide insight into this lack of translation from research to implementation. We note that validation of A tools in the rural US was underwhelming, and ultimately, neglected. The most common form of model validation employed was a single random holdout test set. Half of the included papers mentioned a lack of reliable data sources or limited data volume as a potential challenge in developing and adopting AI/ML tools. The use of patient-level EHR data was often limited to what was available to the authors or at a specific medical center.

Implications of all the available evidence: Our review indicates a gap and highlights opportunity for innovation in leveraging AI tools to predict and support patients in rural communities. Further research is needed to enhance the translation of state-of-the-art modeling techniques into effective AI tools for use in the rural US, including exploring partnerships between academic medical centers and rural communities and solutions to logistic challenges of such partnerships, including data and resource sharing.","NA","medrxiv",1751580566050

A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endoreplicate throughout the flys life, increasing their ploidy and cell volume, while at the same time nearby cells are lost into the gut lumen in an age-dependent process. These cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when endocycling in these cells is experimentally increased or decreased, nuclear and cellular volume as well as peritrophic membrane synthesis is concomitantly enhanced or reduced. Further, we show that blocking endocycling in these cells leads to functional defects in the peritrophic membrane, ultimately leading to increased susceptibility to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function over the course of the adult lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

Here, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 20 years of neural data from the BrainGate and BrainGate2 pilot clinical trials. This dataset spans 2,319 recording sessions and 20 arrays from the first 14 participants in these trials. On average, arrays successfully recorded neural spiking waveforms on 35.6% of electrodes, with only a 7% decline over the study enrollment period (up to 7.6 years, with a mean of 2.8 years). We assessed movement intention decoding performance using a ""decoding signal-to-noise ratio"" (dSNR) metric, and found that 11 of 14 arrays provided meaningful movement decoding throughout study enrollment (dSNR > 1). Three arrays reached a peak dSNR greater than 4.5, approaching that achieved during able-bodied computer mouse control (6.29). We also found that dSNR increases logarithmically with the number of electrodes, providing a pathway for scaling performance. Longevity and reliability of Utah array recordings in this study were better than in prior nonhuman primate studies. However, achieving peak performance consistently will require addressing unknown sources of variability.","NA","medrxiv",1751580566050

They are used to treat metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer, but resistance is common, and this has been associated with TP53 loss and senescence evasion. We show here that enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells that evade senescence mis-segregate chromosomes due to defective chromosomal alignment and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, leading to aneuploidy and DNA damage. The chromosome alignment errors are associated with impaired Sgo1 localisation to centromeres and defective sister chromatin cohesion during mitosis. Importantly, all these mitotic defects can be rescued by constraining cell size during the CDK4/6i-treatment, and specifically restoring cohesion rescues the chromosome segregation errors. Together, this demonstrates mechanistically how cell enlargement drives genetic and karyotypic change in cells that re-enter the cell cycle following CDK4/6 inhibition. This could help fuel the rapid emergence of chemotherapy-resistant clones, especially in p53-null cells that evade senescence to drive drug-resistance in patients.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140 modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1 improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13 to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete on-device browser deployment.

An important mechanism of miRNA regulation is target-directed microRNA degradation (TDMD), a pathway in which the binding of miRNAs to specialized trigger RNAs induces ubiquitylation and decay of associated Argonaute (AGO) proteins by the ZSWIM8 ubiquitin ligase. Concomitant release of miRNAs results in their rapid turnover. ZSWIM8-deficient mice exhibit reduced body size, cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental defects, and perinatal lethality. Despite widespread dysregulation of miRNAs in these animals, the vast majority of presumptive trigger RNAs that induce decay of ZSWIM8-regulated miRNAs remain undefined. Here, using AGO crosslinking and sequencing of hybrids (AGO-CLASH), a high-throughput method for identifying miRNA binding sites, we report the identification of Plagl1 as a TDMD trigger for miR-322-5p, and Lrrc58 and Malat1 as TDMD triggers for miR-503-5p in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In mice, deletion of the miR-322-5p and miR-503-5p trigger sites in the Plagl1 and Lrrc58 3' UTRs, respectively, abrogated TDMD of these miRNAs and resulted in miR-322/503-dependent embryonic growth restriction, recapitulating a key feature of the Zswim8-/- phenotype. Thus, Plagl1 and Lrrc58 act as triggers for degradation of miR-322-5p and miR-503-5p, revealing a noncoding function for these mRNAs as regulators of mammalian body size.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

We analysed genotype array and exome sequence data from two birth cohorts (Millenium Cohort Study and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; n=5,320-8,622) to assess common and rare variant contributions to internalising and externalising symptoms across development. For both symptom domains, we identified associations with several polygenic indices (PGIs) that generally remained stable across development. For externalising symptoms, many of these associations reflected direct genetic effects. Concordant results were observed in the Born in Bradford cohort. A higher exome-wide burden of deleterious rare variants was associated with increased externalising (p-adj<0.03) and internalising symptoms (p-adj<0.01); trio models indicated direct genetic effects on externalising in MCS (p<0.05; p-adj>0.05) and on internalising symptoms in ALSPAC (p-adj<0.02). Common and rare genetic variants contributed independently, jointly explaining 2% of the variance in internalising and 5-7% in externalising symptoms. Finally, we show that the direct genetic effects of several PGIs and of deleterious rare variants on adolescent mental health are mediated by childhood externalising behaviours and/or cognitive ability. This study provides new insights into the genetic architecture of early-life mental health and identifies promising avenues for future research.","NA","medrxiv",1751580566050

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1751580566050

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

To better understand bronchial tissue responses to viral infection, we have developed a preclinical in vitro model mimicking the multiciliated airway epithelium, from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and cultured in an air-liquid interface (iALI). By using iPSCs reprogrammed from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we successfully generated a fully differentiated and functional bronchial epithelium exhibiting key COPD features with goblet and basal cell hyperplasia and tissue inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 could infected and replicated for several weeks in both healthy and COPD models, with a recurrent peak at 3 days after infection. Infected iALI exhibited cilia destruction and increased mucus secretion. Innate immune response of different infected iALI reveals a differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Notably, COPD iALI displayed an earlier innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to healthy iALI, suggesting a genetic susceptibility of COPD iALI towards inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a less efficient response to antivirals. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the iALI bronchial organoid model is a powerful tool for investigating bronchial tissue responses to long term respiratory viral infections, antivirals, and patients with COPD or other airway pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

We subjected human endothelial cells (ECs) and muscle cells (MCs) to cyclic mechanical stretch and investigated acute transcriptomic and metabolomic changes. Mechanical loading induced several responses typically seen after exercise in vivo. Both cell types released acetate in response to stretching, but surprisingly, many of the other changes were in opposite directions. For instance, electron transport chain genes were downregulated in ECs and upregulated in muscle cells. Additionally, ECs shifted their transcriptomic profile to a growth-oriented direction and 13C-(U)-glucose tracing experiments revealed increased serine synthesis in ECs. Mechanistic experiments related to the serine synthesis pathway enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) revealed its importance in EC anabolism. Our data suggest that mechanical loading induces cell type-specific responses in ECs and MCs, and several of these effects recapitulate exercise effects in vivo. In ECs, mechanical loading activates the serine synthesis pathway, and the serine-synthesizing enzyme PHGDH was highlighted as essential in regulating EC growth, a process indispensable in angiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

This process involves proton uptake at the entry half channel, rotor rotation, and proton release to the exit half channel. While the overall coupling mechanism is established, the design principle for efficient rotation remains unclear. Here, we employed hybrid molecular simulations - combining coarse-grained modeling and Monte Carlo methods - to investigate the roles of side chain flexibility at proton-binding residues and the angular mismatch between the proton uptake process and the proton release process. Our results indicate that both factors promote rotational activity, with side chain flexibility playing a more significant role. Comparable analysis of Fo structures from different species revealed that the key residue geometry is conserved, and that the asymmetric geometry of the two half channels aligns with the mechanism suggested by simulation. These findings highlight a conserved design principle that enhances rotational efficiency and offer a mechanistic basis for engineering synthetic rotary systems.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

However, discontinuation is common, and clinical trials have demonstrated significant weight regain following cessation. In this systematic review, we aimed to characterise the trajectory of weight regain after GLP-1RA cessation.

MethodsThis systematic review and meta-regression analysis followed Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to December 26, 2024 for randomised controlled trials and observational studies reporting weight outcomes after cessation of GLP-1RAs in adults with overweight or obesity. Weight regain was the primary outcome and was modelled using nonlinear regression. Secondary outcomes included HbA1c and systolic blood pressure. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD420250631751).

FindingsWe identified 44 relevant studies. Weight, HbA1c and systolic blood pressure consistently rebounded after cessation of GLP-1RAs. Six trials with 3,236 participants were included in the exponential recovery model. Weight regain was estimated to plateau at 75.6% (95% CI 68.5-82.7) of the weight lost on treatment. The rate constant was 0.0302 per week (95% CI 0.0204-0.0399), corresponding to a half-life of 23.0 weeks. At 1 year after cessation, an estimated 40.2% of the on-treatment weight loss remained. Most studies were assessed to have moderate risk of bias.

InterpretationGLP-1RA cessation is associated with a predictable and decelerating pattern of weight regain, which appears to plateau below pre-treatment levels, suggesting that partial weight-loss benefit may persist long-term but is substantially attenuated.

As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures. To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer ontogenetic relationships among cell types. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types. Our results reveal the regulatory complexity underlying cell differentiation in a morphologically simple animal and highlight conserved principles in animal gene regulation.

Golgi defects and RUSH (Retention under Selective Hook) substantiated the role of AP-3 in trans-Golgi DCV budding. Proteomics revealed the loss of specific known and putative novel DCV proteins, which were mislocalized and rerouted to lysosomes in AP-3-depleted cells.

Here, we identify the cellular receptor for C. perfringens necrotizing enteritis toxin F (NetF), a recently discovered toxin implicated in severe enteritis in dogs and foals. We show that NetF binds to the same receptor as anthrax toxin, namely ANTXR2. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the oligomeric NetF pre-pore as well as the transmembrane pore, both alone and in complex with the extracellular domain of ANTXR2. Unlike anthrax toxin, which binds to the apical MIDAS motif of ANTXR2 - as does the natural ANTXR2 ligand collagen type VI - NetF engages the receptor laterally, spanning both the von Willebrand A and the Ig-like domains. This interaction positions the toxin near the membrane, facilitating contact with membrane lipids and promoting transmembrane pore formation. Our findings uncover key principles of hemolysin {beta}PFT-receptor recognition and advance our understanding of how pathogenic bacteria use these toxins to breach host defenses.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

Single-molecule footprinting (SMF) methods that rely on the labeling of individual accessible DNA bases have emerged in recent years as a powerful chromatin accessibility mapping approach, as they provide not just an average readout of accessibility over a given genomic position but also the distribution of accessibility states within a population at the level of individual original DNA molecules. However, SMF approaches have been limited either in their resolution or in labeling readout accuracy. To address these limitations, we have developed a high-resolution strand-specific single molecule footprinting approach (C[-&gt;]U/T-ssSMF) based on the application of highly active sequence context-independent endogenous methylation-insensitive double-strand DNA (dsDNA) deaminases (CseDa01 and LbDa02), which convert accessible cytosines into uracils (and in turn into thymine after amplification). We demonstrate the application of the method to mapping fine-grained single-molecule accessibility states in human cell lines in both a short and a long-read format, and quantifying the occupancy states of individual transcription factors (TFs) as well as TF co-accessibility and strand-specific accessibility patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

Asteraceae capitula are highly diverse but are thought to have evolved once via unknown mechanisms7,8. During capitulum development, shoot stem cells undergo prolonged proliferation to accommodate the formation of intersecting spirals of flowers (florets) along the disk-shaped head9,10. Here we show that capitulum evolution paralleled decreases in CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signaling, a conserved repressor of stem cell proliferation. We trace this to novel amino acid changes in the mature CLV3 peptide which decrease receptor binding and downstream transcriptional outputs. Using genetically tractable Asteraceae models, we show that reversion of CLV3 to a more active form impairs Asteraceae stem cell regulation and capitulum development. Additionally, we trace the evolution of CLV3 and its receptors across the Asterales allowing inferences on capitulum evolution within this lineage.

MORPH combines a discrepancy-based variational autoencoder with an attention mechanism to predict cellular responses to unseen perturbations. It supports both single-cell transcriptomics and imaging outputs and can generalize to unseen perturbations, combinations of perturbations, and perturbations in new cellular contexts. The attention-based framework enables inference of gene interactions and regulatory networks, while the learned gene embeddings can guide the design of informative perturbations. Overall, we envision MORPH as a flexible tool for optimizing perturbation experiments, enabling efficient exploration of the perturbation space to advance understanding of cellular programs for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1751580566050

Analysis of spatial features of the tumor microenvironment revealed that TIME_ACT-high regions exhibit dense lymphocyte infiltration near tumor cells, indicating localized immune activation. Second, in 15 anti-PD1 transcriptomic cohorts spanning six cancer types, TIME_ACT outperforms 22 established signatures and methods, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76 and a clinically meaningful mean odds ratio of 6.11.

A vaccine administered to pregnant women, protecting against [&ge;]70% of K. pneumoniae infections, could avert [~]400,000 cases and [~]80,000 deaths annually, mostly in Africa and South Asia. Vaccine formulations targeting the capsular polysaccharide (K) or lipopolysaccharide (O) antigens are in development. Global K. pneumoniae populations display extensive K and O diversity, necessitating a polyvalent vaccine targeted to the serotypes associated with neonatal disease in relevant geographical regions. We investigated the prevalence of K and O types associated with neonatal sepsis in Africa and South Asia to inform maternal vaccine design.

Methods and FindingsWe analysed n=1930 K. pneumoniae neonate blood isolates from 13 surveillance studies across 35 sites in 13 countries. We used pathogen sequencing to predict K and O serotypes and correct for local transmission clusters, and Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis to estimate K and O prevalence. Eighty-seven K loci were identified. KL2, KL102, KL25, KL15 and KL62 accounted for 49% of isolates. We estimate that 20 K loci, combining the eight most prevalent per region, could cover 72.9% of all infections [95% credible interval, 69.4-76.5%] and [&ge;]70% in each of Eastern, Western and Southern Africa and South Asia. Preliminary findings from three sites suggested sufficient temporal stability of K loci to maintain 20-valent K vaccine coverage over 5-10 years, but more longitudinal data are needed to support this prediction. O types were far less diverse (n=14 types). We estimate the top-5 (O1{beta},2, O1{beta},2{beta}, O2, O2{beta} and O4) would cover 86% [82.6-89.9%] of total infections (76-92% per region), while the top-10 would cover [~]99% of infections in all four regions.

ConclusionsNeonatal sepsis is associated with diverse K and O types, with substantial geographic and temporal variation even after adjusting for localised transmission clusters. Despite this, a single 20-valent K vaccine could theoretically cover [&ge;]70% of infections in all target regions. Locally-targeted vaccines could achieve higher coverage with lower valency, but are less feasible. In principle, very high coverage could be achieved with lower valency O-based vaccines, however protective efficacy of antibodies targeting the O antigen remains uncertain. Further research is needed on cross-reactivity, antigen exposure and stability of antigens over time, to better inform vaccine development.","NA","medrxiv",1751580566050

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1751580566050

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients.

We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1751580566050

In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1751580566050
