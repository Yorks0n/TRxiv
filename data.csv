Longstanding questions over whether task switching requires active preparation remain hotly contested, in large part due to the difficulty of inferring preparatory dynamics from behavior or time-locked neuroimaging. We make progress on this debate by quantifying neural task representations using high-dimensional linear dynamical systems fit to human electroencephalographic recordings. We find that these dynamical systems have high predictive accuracy and reveal neural signatures of active preparation that are shared with task-optimized neural networks. These findings inform a classic debate about how we control our cognition, and offer a promising new paradigm for neuroimaging analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

The bat wing is characterized by an extreme elongation of the second to fifth digits and a wing membrane called chiropatagium connecting them. Here we investigated the developmental and cellular origin of this structure by comparing bat and mouse limbs using omics tools and single-cell analyses. Despite the substantial morphological differences between the species, we observed an overall conservation of cell populations and gene expression patterns including interdigital apoptosis. Single-cell analyses of micro-dissected embryonic chiropatagium identified a specific fibroblast population, independent of apoptosis-associated interdigital cells, as the origin of this tissue. These distal cells express a conserved gene program including the transcription factors MEIS2 and TBX3, which are commonly known to specify and pattern the early proximal limb. Transgenic ectopic expression of MEIS2 and TBX3 in mouse distal limb cells resulted in the activation of genes expressed during wing development and phenotypic changes related to wing morphology, such as the fusion of digits. Our results elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms of bat wing development and illustrate how drastic morphological changes can be achieved through repurposing of existing developmental programs during evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

We generated an atlas of TFBSs across ten flowering plants and demonstrated that conserved TFBSs are strongly enriched for genomic and epigenomic signatures of functional regulatory elements. We uncovered conserved properties of TFBSs, including TF family-specific clustering of binding sites in distinct promoter and gene body locations. By integrating this atlas with single nuclei RNA and chromatin profiles, we elucidated conserved TF activity underlying development and stress responses and annotated key cell type-specific regulatory pathways. Finally, we found that TF ortholog binding specificity is preserved over long evolutionary times, suggesting that divergence of regulatory sequences, rather than TFs, is a primary driver of regulatory evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

In contrast, experimental and theoretical work has argued both for and against the existence of specialized sub-populations of neurons (modules) within single brain regions. By studying artificial neural networks, we show that this local modularity emerges to support context-dependent behavior, but only when the input is low-dimensional. No anatomical constraints are required. We also show when modular specialization emerges at the population level (different modules correspond to orthogonal subspaces). Modularity yields abstract representations, allows for rapid learning and generalization on novel tasks, and facilitates the rapid learning of related contexts. Non-modular representations facilitate the rapid learning of unrelated contexts. Our findings reconcile conflicting experimental results and make predictions for future experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

However, current state-of-the-art models have been trained largely on bulk expression profiles from healthy tissues or cell lines, and have not learned the properties of precise cell types and states that are captured in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Thus, they lack the ability to perform these tasks at the resolution of specific cell types or states across diverse tissue and disease contexts. To address this gap, we present Decima, a model that predicts the cell type- and condition- specific expression of a gene from its surrounding DNA sequence. Decima is trained on single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from over 22 million cells, and successfully predicts the cell type-specific expression of unseen genes based on their sequence alone. Here, we demonstrate Decima's ability to reveal the cis-regulatory mechanisms driving cell type-specific gene expression and its changes in disease, to predict non-coding variant effects at cell type resolution, and to design regulatory DNA elements with precisely tuned, context-specific functions.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

In recent years, several computational methods have been developed to study the heterogeneity of molecules in single-particle cryo-EM. In this study, we analyzed a publicly available single-particle dataset of TRPV1 using five of these methods: 3D Flexible Refinement, 3D Variability Analysis, cryoDRGN, ManifoldEM, and Bayesian ensemble reweighting. Beyond what we initially expected, we have found that this dataset contains significant heterogeneity-- indicating that single particle datasets likely contain a rich spectrum of biologically relevant states. Further, we have found that different methods are best suited to studying different kinds of heterogeneity, with some methods being more sensitive to either compositional or conformational heterogeneity. We also apply a combination of Bayesian ensemble reweighting and molecular dynamics as supporting evidence for the presence of these rarer states within the sample. Finally, we developed a quantitative metric based on the analysis of the singular value decomposition and power spectra to compare the resulting volumes from each method. This work represents a detailed view of the variable outcomes of different heterogeneity methods used to analyze a single real dataset and presents a pathway to a deeper understanding of the biology of complex macromolecules like the TRPV1 ion channel.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

These phenotypes are heterogeneous, dependent on the cell type arrested and the insult inciting arrest. Because a universal biomarker for CS has yet to be identified, combinations of senescence-associated biomarkers linked to various biological stress responses including lysosomal activity ({beta}-galactosidase staining), inflammation (senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, SASPs), and apoptosis (senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways) are used to identify senescent cells.

Using in vitro human bulk RNA-seq datasets, we find that senescent states enrich for various stress responses in a cell-type, temporal, and insult-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that various gene signatures used to identify senescent cells in the literature also enrich for stress responses, and are inadequate for universally and exclusively identifying senescent samples.

Genes regulating stress responses - including transcription factors and genes controlling chromatin accessibility - are contextually differentially expressed, along with key enzymes involved in metabolism across arrest phenotypes. Additionally, significant numbers of SASP proteins can be predicted from senescent cell transcriptomes and also heterogeneously enrich for various stress responses in a context-dependent manner.

We propose that  senescence cannot be meaningfully defined due to the lack of underlying preserved biology across senescent states, and CS is instead a mosaic of stress-induced phenotypes regulated by various factors, including metabolism, TFs, and chromatin accessibility. We introduce the concept of Stress Response Modules, clusters of genes modulating stress responses, and present a new model of CS and CQ induction conceptualised as the differential activation of these clusters.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

To address these issues, we created a benchmarking platform that combines a panel of 11 large-scale perturbation datasets with an expression forecasting software engine that encompasses or interfaces to a wide variety of methods. We used our platform to systematically assess methods, parameters, and sources of auxiliary data, finding that performance strongly depends on the choice of metric, and especially for simple metrics like mean squared error, it is uncommon for expression forecasting methods to out-perform simple baselines.

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Accordingly, the perceived value of a reward varies depending on an animal's current needs. Updating the specific value of rewards predicted by external cues depends on the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, neurophysiological investigations have centered around the assumption of stimulus-invariant value representations and have not been able to account for behavioral findings that support the BLA's ability to represent stimulus-specific value of distinct appetitive or aversive outcomes. To address how the BLA encodes and updates stimulus-specific value representations, we exposed head-fixed mice to distinct sets of gustatory rewards while tracking perceived value using lick microstructural analysis. Two-photon calcium imaging of BLA principal neurons revealed that the magnitude of the BLA population response scaled with perceived reward value and that the values of different rewards were encoded by distinct neuronal subpopulations. Moreover, reward representations rapidly re-scaled when mice were exposed to a reward that was larger than all previous rewards. Finally, value representations depended on an animal's internal state as thirst selectively increased the responses to water rewards whereas aversive experiences strongly attenuated responses to sucrose. Our findings demonstrate that value representations in the BLA are stimulus-specific and highly adaptive to account for changes in relative reward value and to reflect an animal's current affective and homeostatic state.

This process is inherently three-dimensional (3D). Yet, in part due to limitations in imaging and data analysis, cell shape analysis within tissues have been studied as a two-dimensional (2D) approximation, e.g., the Drosophila wing disc. With recent advances in imaging and machine learning, there has been significant progress in our understanding of 3D cell and tissue shape in vivo. However, even after gaining 3D segmentation of cells, it remains challenging to extract cell shape metrics beyond volume and surface area for cells within densely packed tissues. In order to extract 3D shape metrics, we have developed CellMet. This user-friendly tool enables extraction of quantitative shape information from 3D cell and tissue segmentation. It is developed for extracting cell scale information from densely packed tissues, such as cell face properties, cell twist, and cell rearrangements. Our method will improve the analysis of 3D cell shape and the understanding of cell organisation within tissues.

For example, the type II secretion system (T2SS) releases toxins, proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes into the extracellular environment to promote tissue softening and soft rot. In this way, the T2SS promotes virulence of phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. However, the role of the T2SS and its substrates for vascular disease remains enigmatic. Here, we show that the Xps-T2SS allows Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) to breach the tissue barrier between hydathodes - the initial bacterial entry point - and xylem thereby gaining access to the leaf vasculature. Yet, Xps-T2SS was dispensable for bacterial multiplication in the leaf apoplast or inside the hydathode cavity suggesting a role beyond plant defense suppression or nutrient acquisition. Using comparative genomics, four plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) were found to be associated with vascular pathogenesis. Testing gene knockout combinations of those enzymes revealed that virulence of only the quadruple CWDE mutant was down to the level of the xps-T2SS mutant. Our results thus demonstrate that the Xps-T2SS and a set of CWDEs that is likely secreted by this system allow Xcc to break this tissue barrier enabling long-distance mobility of Xcc inside the host plant. We thus expand our understanding on how certain bacterial pathogens have specialized towards vascular pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

We identify dozens of novel lysosomal proteins and reveal the diversity of the lysosomal composition across brain cell types. Notably, we discovered SLC45A1, mutations in which cause a monogenic neurological disease, as a neuron-specific lysosomal protein. Loss of SLC45A1 causes lysosomal dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SLC45A1 plays a dual role in lysosomal sugar transport and stabilization of V1 subunits of the V-ATPase. SLC45A1 deficiency depletes the V1 subunits, elevates lysosomal pH, and disrupts iron homeostasis causing mitochondrial dysfunction.

High-altitude exposure is typically incorporated in elite sport training regimens, but little is known about how this network adapts to an environment characterised by tissue hypoxia. For this reason, we investigated how high-altitude exposure affects mitochondrial subcellular distribution, ultrastructure, respiratory control, and intrinsic mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Nine healthy and recreationally active sea-level residents (eight males and one female) resided at an altitude of 3454 m with biopsies collected from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after 7 and 28 days at high altitude. The muscular mitochondrial volume density (MitoVD) increased after high-altitude exposure, driven by an increase in the intermyofibrillar MitoVD. This was however accompanied by a decreased cristae surface area per skeletal muscle fibre volume (MuscularCD) because of a decline in the cristae surface area per mitochondrial volume (MitoCD). Despite a reduced MuscularCD, mass-specific maximal coupled respiration (OXPHOS_CII+CI+ETF) increased slightly, and was considerably elevated when normalised to MuscularCD, suggesting intrinsic adaptations to high altitude. The difference between cristae-specific OXPHOS_CII+CI+ETF and an associated cristae-specific leak respiration (Leak_CII+CI+ETF) indicated a markedly higher degree of coupling between the electron flow in the electron transport system and ATP production. As the effect size 95% confidence intervals includes trivial effects the results need to be substantiated. In conclusion, high-altitude exposure altered mitochondrial subcellular distribution, ultrastructure and induced intrinsic respiratory adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

In this study, by analyzing a new individual (1.25x) and published Republican samples, we propose a novel perspective for the presence of Near Eastern ancestry in the Imperial gene pool. In our scenario, the spread of this genetic ancestry took place during the late Republican period, predating the onset of the Empire by [~]200 years. The diffusion of this ancestry may have occurred due to early East-to-West movements, since Eastern Mediterranean regions were already under Roman political influence during the Republic, or even as a result of migration from Southern Italy where Greeks and Phoenicians settled.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Our study identifies mgat4b, a glycosyl transferase involved in selective N-glycan branching enriched in pigment progenitors, as a key regulator of directional melanocyte migration and establishment of melanocyte stem cell (McSC) pool during early development. Single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing analysis in zebrafish upon targeted disruption of mgat4b reveals, that migratory melanocyte progenitors marked by galectin expression fail to persist. Lectin affinity proteomic analysis reveals the glycosylation of key melanocyte proteins GPNMB, KIT, and TYRP1 to be under the control of MGAT4B in melanocytic cells. Additionally, mislocalization of Junctional plakoglobin (JUP) explains the observed defects in cell adhesion and migration to be regulated by MGAT4B but not its isozyme MGAT4A. Our meta-analysis further reveals that melanoma patients with both the BRAFV600E mutation and elevated MGAT4B levels have significantly worse survival outcomes compared to those with only the BRAFV600E mutation. By leveraging the MAZERATI platform to model BRAFV600E driver mutation in vivo, we show that mgat4b mutant cells fail to aggregate and initiate tumors. RNA profiling of the transformed melanocytes revealed cell-cell junction, adhesion and ECM binding to be probable contributing factors that resulted in the failure of tumor onset. Using a small-molecule inhibitor we demonstrate the inhibitory role of this complex N-glycosylation in the progression of early-stage melanoma. Our study underscores the importance of selective N-glycan branching in both melanocyte development and melanoma initiation, suggesting MGAT4B as a promising therapeutic target for melanoma treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

However, alternative splicing differs across tissues and conditions.

This active and constantly fluctuating system maintains a delicate mechanochemical state which permits spontaneous polarization and shape change when needed. Combining in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments we show how membrane viscosity and MCA protein length regulate cortical dynamics. We reveal a novel mechanism whereby caging of linker proteins in the actin cortex allows for the amplification of small changes in these key parameters, leading to major alterations of cortical contractility. In cells, this mechanism alone gives rise to symmetry breaking phenomena, suggesting that local changes in lipid composition, in combination with the choice of MCA proteins, contribute to the regulation of cellular morphogenesis and function.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Work by us and others has shown that the choice of these synonymous codon is not random, and carries regulatory and functional consequences. Existing protein foundation models ignore this context-dependent role of coding sequence in shaping the protein landscape of the cell. To address this gap, we introduce cdsFM, a suite of codon-resolution large language models, including both EnCodon and DeCodon models, with up to 1B parameters. Pre-trained on 60 million protein-coding sequences from more than 5,000 species, our models effectively learn the relationship between codons and amino acids, recapitualing the overall structure of the genetic code. In addition to outperforming state-of-the-art genomic foundation models in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, the larger pre-trained models were superior in predicting the choice of synonymous codons. To systematically assess the impact of synonymous codon choices on protein expression and our models' ability to capture these effects, we generated a large dataset measuring overall and surface expression levels of three proteins as a function of changes in their synonymous codons. We showed that our EnCodon models could be readily fine-tuned to predict the contextual consequences of synonymous codon choices. Armed with this knowledge, we applied EnCodon to existing clinical datasets of synonymous variants, and we identified a large number of synonymous codons that are likely pathogenic, several of which we experimentally confirmed in a cell-based model. Together, our findings establish the cdsFM suite as a powerful tool for decoding the complex functional grammar underlying the choice of synonymous codons.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Here, we describe a process driving gap-closure during migration: Contact-mesenchymalization via the axon guidance factor Plexin A.

In Colias eurytheme butterflies, males exhibit two specialized wing scale types -- UV-iridescent (UVI) and lanceolate scales -- absent in females and likely integral to male courtship behavior. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms and single-nucleus transcriptomics underlying these two sexually dimorphic cell types during wing development. We show that Doublesex (Dsx) expression is itself dimorphic and required to repress the UVI cell state in females, while unexpectedly, UVI activation in males is independent from Dsx. In the melanic marginal band, Dsx is required in each sex to enforce the presence of lanceolate scales in males, and their absence in females. Single-nucleus RNAseq reveals that UV-iridescent and lanceolate scale cell precursors each show distinctive gene expression profiles at 40% of pupal development, with marker genes that include regulators of transcription, cell signaling, cytoskeletal patterning, and chitin secretion. Both male-specific cell types share a low expression of the Bric-a-brac (Bab) transcription factor, a key repressor of the UVI fate. Bab ChIP-seq profiling suggests that Bab binds the cis-regulatory regions of gene markers associated to UVI fate, including potential effector genes involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal processes and chitin secretion, and loci showing signatures of recent selective sweeps in an UVI-polymorphic population. These findings open new avenues for exploring wing patterning and scale development, shedding light on the mechanisms driving the specification of sex-specific cell states and the differentiation of specialized cell ultrastructures.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

However, the majority of proteins are of a size that still eludes identification in cellular cryo-EM data, and most proteins exist in low copy numbers. Therefore, novel tools are needed for cryo-EM to identify the vast majority of macromolecules across multiple size scales (from microns to nanometers).

DMTs efficacies increase with MS lesional activity (LA) measured by relapses or contrast-enhancing lesions and decrease with increasing age, disease duration and disability. Unexpectedly, as placebo arms relapse rate rapidly declines with trial duration, efficacy of MS DMTs likewise decreases quickly with treatment duration. Conversely, DMTs morbidity/mortality risks increase with age, advanced disability, and comorbidities. We integrated these results into an interactive personalized web based DMTs risk/benefit estimator.

InterpretationResults predict that prescribing DMTs to patients traditionally excluded from MS clinical trials causes more harm than benefit. Treatment with high efficacy drugs at MS onset followed by de-escalation to DMTs that do not increase infectious risks would optimize risk/benefit. DMTs targeting mechanisms of progression independent of LA are greatly needed as current DMTs inhibit disability caused by LA only.","NA","medrxiv",1729030179562

The most prevalent method for identifying peptides from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry data is database search. Traditional tools typically focus on identifying a single peptide per tandem mass spectrum (MS2), often neglecting the frequent occurrence of peptide co-fragmentations leading to chimeric spectra. Here, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a novel database search algorithm that enhances peptide identification by detecting co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. Utilizing MSFragger's fragment ion indexing algorithm, MSFragger-DDA+ performs a comprehensive search within the full isolation window for each MS2, followed by robust feature detection, filtering, and rescoring procedures to refine search results. Evaluation against established tools across diverse datasets demonstrated that, integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases identification sensitivity while maintaining stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control. It is also uniquely suited for wide-window acquisition (WWA) data. MSFragger-DDA+ provides an efficient and accurate solution for peptide identification, enhancing the detection of low-abundance co-fragmented peptides. Coupled with the FragPipe platform, MSFragger-DDA+ enables more comprehensive and accurate analysis of proteomics data.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

However, in the absence of DNA methylation due to mutations in the DNA methylation machinery or in certain developmental contexts, the same TEs can gain Polycomb-associated H3K27me3, another epigenetic silencing mark that is usually linked with the facultative silencing of genes. In this study, we initially aimed to investigate whether DNA methylation and H3K27me3 could compete during the establishment of silencing at TEs in the model plant Arabidopsis. Strikingly, we show that the deposition of the H3K27me3 mark at newly inserted transgenic TE sequences is impaired in plants in which the de novo DNA methyltransferase DRM2 is mutated, contrary to the competition model hypothesized. Further profiling of H3K27me3 in drm2 mutants and in the DNA demethylase mutant rdd confirmed this new role of DNA methylation in promoting H3K27me3 deposition at some TEs, in addition to the previously described antagonistic role at others. These findings further reveal a new function of DNA demethylation in modulating H3K27me3 levels in vegetative tissues, which we confirmed via targeted DNA methylation experiments. Together, our results uncover a novel crosstalk between DNA methylation and Polycomb at TEs and reveal that these two pathways, thought to be specialized and antagonistic, can be interdependent and cooperate more than anticipated to maintain genome and epigenome integrity in eukaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Zymoseptoria tritici, an important fungal pathogen of wheat, has a compartmentalized and rapidly evolving genome. In the genome of the reference isolate Z. tritici IPO323, 8 of the 21 chromosomes are accessory. In spite of the profound impact on genome organization, the origin of accessory chromosomes in Z. tritici is still poorly understood. Combining genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics, we discovered a new chromosome in Z. tritici isolates infecting wild grasses from the genus Aegilops, and we use this discovery to study the origin of accessory chromosomes. The newly identified chromosome presents similar characteristics to known accessory chromosomes in Zymoseptoria species, including presence-absence variation, low gene expression in vitro and in planta, and enrichment with heterochromatin-associated histone methylation marks (H3K27me3). Interestingly, we found an orthologous chromosome in Zymoseptoria ardabiliae, a closely related fungal species also infecting wild grasses. This ortholog chromosome also presents accessory chromosomes characteristics, but lacks the enrichment of heterochromatin-associated methylation marks. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the orthologous chromosome in Z. ardabiliae harbors active transposable elements (TEs) congruent with lower signatures of host-genome defense mechanisms against TE expansion and spread (quantified as repeat-induced-point (RIP) mutation signatures). Our findings suggest that the chromosome has been exchanged between Z. tritici and Z. ardabiliae by introgressive hybridization events underlining the relevance of hybridization in the evolution of new accessory chromosomes. We speculate that the regulation of TEs has not yet occurred on this new accessory chromosome in Z. ardabiliae, contributing to its rapid evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Absence of a diagnosis creates uncertainty around recurrence after transplantation, familial risk, and participation in therapeutic trials. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to identify genetic variants contributing to uKF. Methods: 218 patients who presented with uKF < 50 years old were recruited to the UKs 100,000 Genomes Project. Candidate variants in 183 genes were reviewed for pathogenicity by a multidisciplinary team. Gene-based association testing, structural variant analyses, and assessment of high-risk APOL1 genotypes were performed. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for chronic kidney disease (CKD), and various glomerulonephritides. HLA associations in those with APOL1 high-risk genotype were also investigated. Results: A positive genetic diagnosis was made in 17% (38/218) of patients. The median age of uKF onset was 36 years. Fewer genetic diagnoses were found in those aged >36 years compared to younger individuals, both with (11% vs. 35%, P=0.03) and without (5% vs. 19%, P=0.05) a family history. Three patients [&ge;] 36 years without a family history had pathogenic variants in type IV collagen genes. The high-risk APOL1 genotype was enriched in patients with recent African ancestry (52% vs 8.4%, P =5.97x10-8). Dividing the uKF cohort by subsequent identification of monogenic diagnosis, high-risk APOL1 genotype, or neither, we found that the SSNS PRS was higher in those with high-risk APOL1 (P=0.048), driven by differences at HLA-DQB1*03:19 (P=0.001). Conclusions: These findings estimate the likelihood of a genetic diagnosis using WGS in uKF patients, showing fewer diagnoses in older patients without a family history. APOL1 contributes significantly to uKF in those with recent African ancestry, potentially interacting with HLA-DQB1. The lack of PRS signal for CKD suggests distinct biology between uKF and more common causes of CKD.","NA","medrxiv",1729030179562

Treatment aimed mainly at pain reduction, which may not target the underlying pathophysiology, is frequently ineffective. Another impediment to the effective management of SFN may be the significant between-patient heterogeneity. Accordingly, we launched this study to gain insights into the symptomatic variability of SFN and determine if SFN patients can be sub-grouped based on clinical characteristics.

MethodsTo characterize the phenotype and investigate how patients with SFN differ from those with large fiber involvement, 105 patients with skin-biopsy proven SFN and 45 with mixed fiber neuropathy (MFN) were recruited. Using unsupervised machine learning, SFN patients were clustered based upon symptom concurrence and severity. Demographics, clinical data, symptoms, and skin biopsy- and laboratory findings were compared between the groups.

ResultsMFN- as compared to SFN patients, were more likely to be male, older, had a lower intraepidermal nerve fiber density at the ankle and more frequent abnormal immunofixation. Beyond these differences, symptom prevalence and intensities were similar in the two cohorts. SFN patients comprised three distinct phenotypic clusters, which differed significantly in symptom severity, co-occurrence, localization, and skin biopsy findings. Only one subgroup, constituting about 20% of the patient population, was characterized by intense neuropathic pain, which was always associated with several other SFN symptoms of similarly high intensities. A pauci-symptomatic cluster comprised patients who experienced few SFN symptoms, generally of low to moderate intensity. The largest cluster was characterized by intense fatigue, myalgias and subjective weakness, but lower intensities of burning pain and paresthesia.

DiscussionThis data-driven study introduces a new approach to subgrouping patients with SFN. Considering both neuropathic pain and pernicious symptoms beyond pain, we identified three clusters, which may be related to distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Although additional validation will be required, our findings represent a step towards stratified treatment approaches and, ultimately, personalized treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1729030179562

How adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) control inflammaging is not well understood in part because the molecular identities of niche-specific ATMs are incompletely known. Using intravascular labeling to exclude circulating myeloid cells and subsequent single-cell sequencing with orthogonal validation, we define the diversity and alterations in niche resident ATMs through lifespan. Aging led to depletion of vessel-associated macrophages (VAMs), expansion of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs), and emergence of a unique subset of CD38+ age-associated macrophages (AAMs) in visceral white adipose tissue (VAT). Interestingly, CD169+CD11c- ATMs are enriched in a subpopulation of nerve-associated macrophages (NAMs) that declines with age. Depletion of CD169+ NAMs in aged mice increases inflammaging and impairs lipolysis suggesting that they are necessary for preventing catecholamine resistance in VAT. These findings reveal specialized ATMs control adipose homeostasis and link inflammation to tissue dysfunction during aging.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

It should be particularly topical in the case of soil organisms, which represent the majority of known species, but still suffer from a considerable taxonomic knowledge deficit. We propose here an estimation of the global number of earthworm species based on the Joppa approach, which models taxonomic effort over time in order to estimate the total number of known and as yet unknown species in a given taxa. Our Bayesian estimation of this model allows us to propose a global diversity of the order of 30,000 species. However, the uncertainty around this estimate is considerable due to severe undersampling and as the model cannot unambiguously decide whether we are describing few species because of a small pool of as yet unknown species, or because of a lack of taxonomic efficiency. This means that the 5,679 species and subspecies already described only represent around 20% of the global number of earthworm species. Considering the current rate of new species description, we calculate that it would take at least 120 years to describe all the species existing on Earth. We discuss the strategies that could be developed to reduce the magnitude of this taxonomic deficit.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

This interplay leads to the enrichment of cohesin at barriers, isolation between neighboring topologically associating domains, and elevated contact frequency between convergent CTCF barriers across the genome. However, recent in vivo measurements present a puzzle: reported residence times for CTCF on chromatin are in the range of a few minutes, while lifetimes for cohesin are much longer. Can the observed features of genome folding result from the action of relatively transient barriers? To address this question, we developed a dynamic barrier model, where CTCF sites switch between bound and unbound states with rates that can be directly compared with biophysical measurements. Using this model, we investigated how barrier dynamics would impact observables for a range of experimental genomic and imaging datasets, including ChIP-seq, Hi-C, and microscopy. We found the interplay of CTCF and cohesin binding timescales influence the strength of each of these features, leaving a signature of barrier dynamics even in the population-averaged snapshots offered by genomic datasets. First, in addition to barrier occupancy, barrier bound times are crucial for instructing features of genome folding. Second, the ratio of boundary to extruder lifetime greatly alters simulated ChIP-seq and simulated Hi-C. Third, large-scale changes in chromosome morphology observed experimentally after increasing extruder lifetime require dynamic barriers. By integrating multiple sources of experimental data, our biophysical model argues that CTCF barrier bound times effectively approach those of cohesin extruder lifetimes. Together, we demonstrate how models that are informed by biophysically measured protein dynamics broaden our understanding of genome folding.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Software designed for transcript-level differential expression analyses account for the uncertainty of transcript quantification, the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA), in statistical analyses via resampling methods. Bootstrap sampling is a popular resampling method that is implemented in the RNA-seq quantification tools kallisto and Salmon. However, bootstrapping is computationally intensive and provides replicate counts with low resolution when the number of sequence reads originating from a gene is low. For lowly expressed genes, bootstrap sampling results in noisy replicate counts for the associated transcripts, which in turn leads to non reproducible and unrealistically high RTA-dispersion for those transcripts. Gibbs sampling is a more efficient and high resolution algorithm implemented in Salmon. Here we leverage the developments of edgeR v4 to present an improved differential transcript expression analysis pipeline with Salmons Gibbs sampling algorithm. The new bias-corrected quasi-likelihood method with adjusted deviances for small counts from edgeR, combined with the efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm from Salmon, provides faster and more accurate DTE analyses of RNA-seq data.

Seed dormancy and germination are key traits which respond strongly to temperature during seed development and here we show that progeny adaptation to seasonal climate is inherited from the mother plant. Loss of maternal LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1) causes an inability of progeny seeds to sense temperature and this is linked mechanistically to reduced ABA levels in seeds and activation of the primary nitrate response. At the single cell level, small changes in temperature activate nitrate signalling specifically in the mother, and ABA biosensor imaging reveals temperature-dependent fluxes of ABA into seeds necessary for dormancy induction. Thus, we reveal that progeny seeds inherit the climate adaptation of mother plants via active hormone transport during seed set.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Therefore, to understand how variable histories of drug reinforcement might affect goal-directed and habitual pursuit of drug rewards, we trained rats to perform a multi-step decision-making task to earn oral fentanyl or sucrose rewards following extensive training with either fentanyl or sucrose. Importantly, this task allowed for independent measurements of goal-directed and habitual choice characteristics during online pursuit of rewards, and habitual choice could further be categorized into perseverative and reward-guided components. Extensive fentanyl training led to a bias for reward-guided habitual choice specifically in females, and a relatively high degree of perseveration in both sexes. These behavioral changes after chronic fentanyl generalized across fentanyl and sucrose seeking. In contrast, during fentanyl sessions, females showed increased perseveration, and both sexes showed blunting of the gradual improvement in goal-directed choice. These results show that chronic drug reinforcement induced habits that generalized across seeking drug and non-drug rewards, and female rats were especially susceptible to habitual control induced by both chronic and acute drug reinforcement.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Using computational techniques, we identified stabilizing point mutations and designed a structured linker connecting the original N and C termini of the circular permutated protein, thereby significantly improving thermostability and activity of cpHalo{Delta}.

QT45 can synthesize both its complementary strand from a mix of all 64 trinucleotides and a copy of itself using 13 defined trinucleotides and one hexamer as substrates.

However, many patients fail to respond, especially those with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), suggesting the existence of additional immune checkpoints that act through orthogonal mechanisms. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-7 and -9 are newly designated glycoimmune checkpoints that are abundantly expressed by tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. We discovered that T cells express only basal levels of Siglec transcripts; instead, they acquire Siglec-7 and -9 from interacting myeloid cells in the TME via trogocytosis, which impairs their activation and effector function. Mechanistically, Siglec-7 and -9 suppress T cell activity by dephosphorylating T cell receptor (TCR)-related signaling cascades. Using sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry, we developed a ligand that binds to Siglec-7 and -9 with high-affinity and exclusive specificity. Using this ligand, we constructed a Siglec-7/9 degrader that targets membrane Siglec-7 and -9 to the lysosome for degradation. Administration of this degrader induced efficient Siglec degradation in both T cells and myeloid cells in the TME. We found that Siglec-7/9 degradation has a negligible effect on macrophage phagocytosis, but significantly enhances T cell anti-tumor immunity. The degrader, particularly when combined with anti-CTLA-4, enhanced macrophage antigen presentation, reshaped the TME, and resulted in long-lasting T cell memory and excellent tumor control in multiple murine tumor models. These findings underscore the need to consider exogenous checkpoints acquired by T cells in the TME when selecting specific checkpoint blockade therapy to enhance T cell immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

However, most of the ligands described to date lack intra-G4 selectivity, severely limiting their potential for uncovering the biological function of individual G4s across the genome. To overcome these limitations, we developed ATENA (Approach to Target Exact Nucleic Acid alternative structures). ATENA relies on the chemical modification of established G4-ligands to enable their conjugation onto a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) using HaloTag, allowing for the targeting of individual G4s in living cells. We have systematically screened the length of the PEG-linkers connecting the G4-ligands to the HaloTag and sgRNA sequences to attain optimal G4 engagement both in vitro and in cells. Using optimized conditions, we leveraged ATENA to demonstrate how the selective targeting of the well-studied G4 in the promoter of the oncogene c-MYC suppresses its transcription exclusively from the P1 promoter. We also show that positioning ligands in the proximity of regulatory elements suppresses c-MYC transcription in a G4-independent manner, highlighting the importance of appropriate design to measure genuine G4-mediated transcriptional changes. We also demonstrate that selective targeting of a G4 in the PVT1 promoter can either stimulate or repress its transcription depending on the type of G4-ligand used, indicating that functional responses associated with G4-stabilization can highly depend on the type of ligand used. We further harnessed ATENA to study transcriptional perturbation associated with cell-specific G4s, revealing that the functional responses associated with these structures are tightly linked with the expression levels of the targeted gene. Our study provides critical insights into G4-based therapeutic design, offering an innovative platform to investigate G4 biology with high precision.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Previously, the overamplification of the glyphosate-resistance gene, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSPS), in A. palmeri was determined to be driven by an extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA). Here, a novel eccDNA is described that carries both glyphosate and glufosinate-ammonium target site due to co-duplication of their chromosomic native region, conferring resistance. Besides EPSPS, the novel replicon has a region replaced by a fragment carrying the GS2 isoforms (GS2.1 and GS2.2) and other genes. The co-existence of eccDNA carrying only EPSPS was confirmed in MSR2 samples harboring dual targeting eccDNA. The genomic structure of GS2 and EPSPS amplification was also assessed in a different glufosinate-resistant A. palmeri accession (MSR1) along with MSR2. The accessions showed distinct GS2.1 and GS2.2 amplification patterns suggesting the existence of diverse replicons that were not assembled here. The EPSPS was amplified in both accessions, and a correlation was observed with the GS2 isoforms in MSR2, further supporting the co-existence of these genes in the same replicon.

The vascular pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) enters through hydathodes, organs at the leaf margin involved in guttation. Subsequently, Xcc breaks out from infected hydathodes, progressing into the xylem vessels and causing systemic disease. To elucidate the mechanisms that underpin the different stages of Xcc pathogenesis, a need exists to image Xcc progression in planta in a non-invasive manner. Here, we describe a phenotyping setup and Python image analysis pipeline capturing the Xcc infection in 16 Arabidopsis thaliana plants in parallel over time. The setup used both an RGB to capture disease symptoms and an ultra-sensitive CCD camera to monitor bacterial progression inside the leaves using bioluminescence. We demonstrate that the image analysis pipeline reliably quantifies bacterial growth in planta for two bacterial species, that is vascular Xcc and the mesophyll pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. The resolution of the camera allowed early detection of Xcc in the hydathodes, yielding valuable information on this early stage of the Xcc infection process. The data obtained through the automated image analysis pipeline was robust and validated findings from other bioluminescence imaging methods, while requiring fewer samples. We can thus quantify the resistance level of a large number of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and mutant lines to different bacterial strains in a non-invasive manner for phenotypic screenings.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Efficient coding theory posits a unified framework for understanding how neural systems enhance encoding accuracy by tuning to environmental statistics. While this theory has been thoroughly explored within the perceptual realm, it is less clear how efficient coding applies to the motor system. Here, we probe the core principles of efficient coding theory through center-out reaching tasks. Our results reveal novel sequential effects in motor planning. Specifically, current movements are biased in a direction opposite to recent movements, and movement variance increases with the angular divergence between successive actions. These effects are modulated by the variability within the motor system: a larger repulsive bias is observed when movements are performed with the nondominant hand compared to the dominant hand, and in individuals exhibiting higher motor variance compared to those with lower variance. These behavioral findings align with the predictions of an efficient coding model, suggesting that the motor system rapidly adapts to the context to enhance accuracy in motor planning.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

This occurs in the olfactory system, where OSNs are highly sensitive to low concentrations of odors and maintain discriminability in complex odor environments. How olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) maintain both sensitivity and sparsity is not well understood. Here, we investigated whether the calcium-activated chloride channel, TMEM16B, may support these dual roles in OSNs. We used multiphoton microscopy to image the stimulus-response density of OSNs in the olfactory epithelium. In TMEM16B knockout mice, we found that sensory representations were denser, and the magnitude of OSN responses was increased. Behaviorally, these changes in sensory representations were associated with an increased aversion to the odorant trimethylamine, which switches perceptual valence as its concentration increases, and a decreased efficiency of olfactory-guided navigation. Together, our results indicate that the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16B sparsens sensory representations in the peripheral olfactory system and contributes to efficient integrative olfactory-guided behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize the molecular diversity of brain cells across six developmental stages and four brain regions in the mouse and marmoset brain. Our analysis of over 170,000 single astrocyte nuclei revealed striking regional heterogeneity among astrocytes, particularly between telencephalic and diencephalic regions, at all developmental time points surveyed in both species. At the stages sampled, most of the region patterning was private to astrocytes and not shared with neurons or other glial types. Though astrocytes were already regionally patterned in late embryonic stages, this region-specific astrocyte gene expression signature changed dramatically over postnatal development, and its composition suggests that regional astrocytes further specialize postnatally to support their local neuronal circuits. Comparing across species, we found divergence in the expression of astrocytic region- and age-differentially expressed genes and the timing of astrocyte maturation relative to birth between mouse and marmoset, as well as hundreds of species differentially expressed genes. Finally, we used expansion microscopy to show that astrocyte morphology is largely conserved across gray matter forebrain regions in the mouse, despite substantial molecular divergence.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Since then, there have been several spillover events to cats, poultry, and humans. Multiple reports have discovered infectious virus in raw milk from infected dairy cows. Infectious virus can also last over a period on milking machine surfaces as a potential route of spread in cattle and contamination in raw milk. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared commercial pasteurized milk as safe for consumption given the lack of infectious virus, there have been numerous reports that up to 30 percent of commercial milk tested were positive for HPAI H5N1 influenza virus genome copies. This is not necessarily unique to the HPAI H5N1 virus, as retrospective studies have identified H1N1 and H3N2 seropositivity in cows linked to decreased milk production. However, it is unknown how repeat exposure to the remaining viral proteins and genomic material in pasteurized milk modulates immune responses once ingested. We developed a successful in-house pasteurization protocol that inactivated high viral loads of the pandemic H1N1 strain A/California/04/2009 (Cal09) or bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 (A/bovine/Ohio.B24OSU-439/2024) viruses in raw milk. Mice were administered this milk daily for five days and rechallenged with each respective virus. We found that repeated oral exposure to inactivated virus was not sufficient to prevent or accelerate mortality from lethal challenge of HPAI H5N1, though it did result in a [~]0.5 log10 reduction viral titers in the brain and delayed clinical signs. In contrast, oral gavage of mice with pre-existing immunity to H1N1 influenza virus with virus pasteurized in milk were protected from morbidity and mortality upon bovine H5N1 viral challenge. These findings suggest that ingestion of inactivated HPAI H5N1 has limited potential health risk and does not prevent protective immune history-mediated responses to lethal infection.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

However, there is no universal drug delivery vehicle that can deliver therapeutics irrespective of the choice of cargo. Here, we present a method to engineer lipid vesicles with asymmetric leaflets and show that they can deliver mRNA and proteins to cells. We also find that the leaflet asymmetry can increase the lipid vesicle uptake by cells.

Moreover, our findings extend beyond mRNA cargos by showcasing the effectiveness of asymmetric vesicles in delivering a wide range of proteins to cells, including the promising CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.

Here, we use human pluripotent stem cells to reconstruct an in vitro cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit by creating a four-part loop assembloid. More specifically, we generate regionalized neural organoids that resemble the key elements of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit, and functionally integrate them into loop assembloids using custom 3D-printed biocompatible wells. Volumetric and mesoscale calcium imaging, as well as extracellular recordings from individual parts of these assembloids reveal the emergence of synchronized patterns of neuronal activity. In addition, a multi-step rabies retrograde tracing approach demonstrate the formation of neuronal connectivity across the network in loop assembloids. Lastly, we apply this system to study heterozygous loss of ASH1L gene associated with autism spectrum disorder and Tourette syndrome and discover aberrant synchronized activity in disease model assembloids. Taken together, this human multi-cellular platform will facilitate functional investigations of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit in the context of early human development and in disease conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Previous studies indicated that ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1) and ERL2 receptors and their extracellular ligand EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE2 (EPFL2) promote seed density while ERECTA inhibits it. Here, we show that all three receptors and two ligands, EPFL1 and EPFL2, promote ovule initiation. After initiation, EPFL1 and EPFL2 redundantly regulate the elongation of nascent ovules and promote the growth of the funiculus. The synergy of EPFL1 and EPFL2 with CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON boundary genes in the regulation of ovule number and shape suggests cooperation in their function. Ovule initiation starts with the specification of ovule founder cells that are separated by boundary cells. During ovule bulging, a new cell type, characterized by a high proliferative rate, forms between ovule founder and boundary cells. In the epfl1 epfl2 mutant, marker genes for ovule founder and boundary cells are expressed much more broadly. Our data indicate that ERECTA family signaling is necessary for efficient cell fate separation at the earliest stages of ovule initiation. Later, it promotes the formation of a zone of high proliferation at the base of the ovule.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Yet, protein abundance also depends on the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation rates. To estimate the contributions of such post transcriptional regulation, we quantified the proteomes of 5,883 single cells from human testis using 3 distinct mass spectrometry methods (SCoPE2, pSCoPE, and plexDIA). To distinguish between biological and technical factors contributing to differences between protein and RNA levels, we developed BayesPG, a Bayesian model of transcript and protein abundance that systematically accounts for technical variation and infers biological differences. We use BayesPG to jointly model RNA and protein data collected from 29,709 single cells across different methods and datasets. BayesPG estimated consensus mRNA and protein levels for 3,861 gene products and quantified the relative protein-to-mRNA ratio (rPTR) for each gene across six distinct cell types in samples from human testis. About 28 % of the gene products exhibited significant differences at protein and RNA levels and contributed to about 1,500 significant GO groups. We observe that specialized and context specific functions, such as those related to spermatogenesis are regulated after transcription. Among hundreds of detected post translationally modified peptides, many show significant abundance differences across cell types. Furthermore, some phosphorylated peptides covary with kinases in a cell-type dependent manner, suggesting cell-type specific regulation. Our results demonstrate the potential of inferring protein regulation in complex tissues from single-cell proteogenomic data and provide a generalizable model, BayesPG, for performing such analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Although several brain regions are known to encode social information, the specific cortical regions and circuits involved in the consolidation of social memory and the nature of the information encoded in the cortex remain unclear. Using in vivo Ca2+ imaging and optogenetic manipulations, we found that infralimbic (IL) neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens shell (IL[-&gt;]NAcSh) neurons store consolidated social memory. Inactivating IL[-&gt;]NAcSh neurons that responded to a familiar conspecific impaired the recognition of other familiar mice including littermates, demonstrating that these neuronal activities support social familiarity. Furthermore, inactivating hippocampal ventral CA1 neurons projecting to the IL disrupted the consolidation of memory for newly familiarized mice while sparing the recognition of littermates. These findings demonstrate the critical role of hippocampal-cortical interactions in the consolidation of social memory.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Therefore, there is a need for other therapies with broad efficiency. Here, we targeted the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We purified three single domain heavy chain antibodies (VHHs) after immunization of an alpaca with the ectodomain of ACE2. These VHHs bound ACE2 with nanomolar affinity and specifically detected membrane-anchored ACE2. Two of them (B07 and B09) neutralized by a competitive mechanism multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates, including Omicron variants (XBB.1.16.1; EG.5.1.3; BA.2.86.1), without impacting the proteolytic activity of the enzyme. Fusion of B07 with conventional Fc domain markedly improved its binding and neutralizing efficacy. This dimeric Fc-conjugated B07 (B07-Fc) recognized specific residues of the N-terminal helix 1 of ACE2. When administrated prophylactically and intranasally, B07-Fc induced a strong dose-dependent protection of mice expressing human ACE2 (K18-hACE2) from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. Hamsters were weakly protected due to low binding of B07-Fc to hamster ACE2. These single domain antibodies targeting hACE2 represent potential broad-spectrum therapeutic candidates against any emerging viruses using ACE2 as a receptor. These inhalable neutralizing single domain antibodies also represent a non-invasive approach against respiratory viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

We reasoned that designed agonists that induce different conformational changes in the receptor might induce different downstream responses, which could be useful both therapeutically and to shed light on how extracellular conformation is coupled to intracellular signaling. We used de novo protein design to first generate binders to individual IR extracellular domains, and then to fuse these together in different orientations and with different conformational flexibility. We describe a series of synthetic agonists that signal through the IR that differ from insulin and from each other in the induction of receptor autophosphorylation, MAPK activation, intracellular trafficking, and cell proliferation. We identify designs that are more potent than insulin causing much longer lasting reductions in glucose levels, and that retain signaling activity on disease-causing receptor mutants that do not respond to insulin. These results inform our understanding of how changes in receptor conformation and dynamics are transmitted to downstream signaling, and our synthetic agonists have considerable therapeutic potential for diabetes and severe insulin resistance syndromes.

Many reconciliation algorithms consider only duplication and loss events (and sometimes horizontal transfer), ignoring effects of the coalescent process, including incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we present a new algorithm for carrying out reconciliation that accurately accounts for incomplete lineage sorting by treating ILS as a series of nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) events. For discordant branches of the gene tree identified by last common ancestor (LCA) mapping, our algorithm recursively chooses the optimal history by comparing the cost of duplication and loss to the cost of NNI and loss. We demonstrate the accuracy of our new method, which we call reconcILS, using a new simulation engine (dupcoal) that can accurately generate gene trees produced by the interaction of duplication, ILS, and loss. We show that reconcILS is much more accurate than models that ignore ILS, and at least as accurate or better than the leading method that can model ILS, duplication, and loss. We discuss how our method can also be extended in the future for use as a reconciliation algorithm in additional scenarios.

Such patterns fulfill both biotic and abiotic functions, mediating plant-pollinator communication and providing protection against damaging UV rays or desiccation. These motifs are often evolutionary labile, varying in size, shape and hue between closely related species and constitute excellent systems to illuminate the evolutionary processes that generate morphological diversity or instead lead to the repetitive emergence of similar forms. Hibiscus trionum flowers have a prominent bullseye pattern combining a purple center contrasting against a white margin. H. trionum belongs to a small clade of Hibiscus known as the Trionum Complex that displays a range of petal patterns within and between species. Here, we integrate phylogenomic approaches, molecular techniques and genetic manipulation to solve species relationships across the Trionum Complex, identify key genes involved in the production of bullseye pigmentation, and reveal molecular events underpinning pattern variation during the evolution of the group. We find that repetitive bullseye reduction events primarily occur through independent modifications of a single genetic locus encoding BERRY1, an R2R3 MYB that regulates anthocyanin pigment production in petals. Moreover, we demonstrate that buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) discriminate against flowers with smaller bullseye sizes suggesting that a reduction in bullseye proportions potentially impacts plant fitness and contributes to trait distribution across the group. Collectively, our results demonstrate how repeated mutations in a single locus led to morphological variation in petal patterning, a trait that contributes to angiosperm reproductive isolation and speciation.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Studies to determine the dynamic changes in synaptic proteins nanoarchitecture typically rely on immunolabeling, or on the expression of fluorescent proteins. The former employs chemical fluorophores and signal amplification, but requires fixation. The latter disturbs the cells minimally, but uses suboptimal fluorophores. Self-labeling tags have been introduced to combine the advantages of these approaches, and here we introduce a knock-in mouse line where the essential synaptic protein Munc13-1 is endogenously fused to the self-labeling SNAP tag. We demonstrate efficient Munc13-1-SNAP labeling in fixed neurons and brain sections by various SNAP dyes, as well as by a novel bright and far-red compound, SBG-SiR-d12, which we introduce here. SBG-SiR-d12 is designed as a membrane impermeable dye, but we repurposed it to stain cytosolic Munc13-1-SNAP in permeabilized, fixed cells and tissue, where we find it outperforms other dyes as evaluated by both conventional and super-resolution microscopy.

The underlying neural mechanisms are attributed theoretically to effects of variant connective tissue on the precision of interoceptive representations contributing to emotions.

MethodsWe used functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI) to quantify regional brain responses to emotional stimuli (facial expressions) in patients with generalised anxiety disorder (N=30) and a non-anxious comparison group (N=33). All participants were assessed for joint laxity and were classified (using Brighton Criteria) for the presence and absence of Hypermobility Syndrome (HMS: now considered Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder).

ResultsHMS participants showed attenuated neural reactivity to emotional faces in specific frontal (inferior frontal gyrus, pre-supplementary motor area), midline (anterior mid and posterior cingulate cortices), and parietal (precuneus and supramarginal gyrus) regions. Notably, interaction between HMS and anxiety was expressed in reactivity of left amygdala (a region implicated in threat processing) and mid insula (primary interoceptive cortex) where activity was amplified in HMS patients with generalised anxiety disorder. Severity of hypermobility in anxious, compared to non-anxious, individuals correlated with activity within anterior insula (implicated as the neural substrate linking anxious feelings to physiological state). Amygdala-precuneus functional connectivity was stronger in HMS, compared to non-HMS, participants.

ConclusionsThe predisposition to anxiety in people with variant connective tissue reflects dynamic interactions between neural centres processing threat (amygdala) and representing bodily state (insular and parietal cortices). Correspondingly, interventions to regulate of amygdala reactivity while enhancing interoceptive precision may have therapeutic benefit for symptomatic hypermobile individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1729030179562

While traditional approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely-related ([~]11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans, which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Recent single cell RNA-sequencing studies have highlighted the diversity and functional heterogeneity of fibroblast populations in multiple fibrotic conditions. These include a novel pathogenic population of high collagen-producing fibroblasts, characterised by expression of the secreted glycoprotein, collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1). The cardinal pro-fibrotic mediator TGF-{beta}1 has been widely implicated in promoting fibrogenesis and is a potent inducer of CTHRC1 and COL1A1 expression. In addition to the canonical Smad signalling pathway, TGF-{beta}1-induced collagen I production is under critical regulatory control by the mTORC1/4E-BP1 signalling hub. Using pharmacological inhibition in combination with gene-editing approaches, we now demonstrate that the role of the mTORC1 axis extends to the regulation of over a third of all TGF-{beta}1 regulated matrisome genes. We provide further evidence that the global transcriptome of TGF-{beta}1-stimulated fibroblasts in vitro matches that of a subpopulation of the high collagen expressing CTHRC1+ pathological fibroblast population in the IPF lung. In contrast, the TGF-{beta}1 induced transcriptome of fibroblasts in which mTORC1 signalling is disrupted (by RPTOR gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9) does not map to any fibroblast population present in human control or fibrotic lung. Using the novel and selective mTORC1 inhibitor RMC-5552, we further demonstrate a direct functional link between mTORC1 signalling and the acquisition of key marker genes which define the CTHRC1+ fibroblast population in IPF. These data demonstrate, for the first time, a critical role for the mTORC1 signalling hub in determining the transcriptional identity of the CTHRC1+ pathological fibroblast population and provide strong scientific support for targeting mTORC1 as a therapeutic strategy in IPF and potentially other fibrotic conditions associated with dysregulated TGF-{beta}1 signalling in the fibrotic niche.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

One approach to this problem has been to test specific hypotheses on the relevance of a visual property (e.g. orientation or color), build a set of ""artificial"" stimuli that vary along that property and then record neural responses to those stimuli. Here, we present a complementary, data-driven method to retrieve the tuning properties of visual neurons. Exploiting deep generative networks and electrophysiology in monkeys, we first used a method to reconstruct any stimulus from its evoked neuronal activity in the inferotemporal cortex (IT). Then, by arbitrarily perturbing the response of individual cortical sites in the model, we generated naturalistic and interpretable sequences of images that strongly influence neural activity of that site. This method enables the discovery of previously unknown tuning properties of high-level visual neurons that are easily interpretable, which we tested with carefully controlled stimuli. When we knew which images drove the neurons, we activated the cells with electrical microstimulation and observed a predicable shift of the monkey perception in the direction of the preferred image. By allowing the brain to tell us what it cares about, we are no longer limited by our experimental imagination.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Understanding how a cis-regulatory landscape integrates information from many dynamically expressed TFs has remained a challenge. We develop a combined CRISPR-screening approach using endogenous RNA and RE-reporters as readouts. Applied to the Xist locus, crucial for X-chromosome inactivation in females, this method allows us to comprehensively identify Xist-controlling TFs and map their TF-RE wiring. We find a group of transiently expressed TFs that regulate proximal REs, driving the binary activation of Xist expression. These basal activators are more highly expressed in cells with two X chromosomes, potentially driving female-specific Xist upregulation. A second set of developmental TFs is upregulated later during differentiation and targets distal REs. This regulatory axis is crucial to achieve high levels of Xist RNA, which is necessary for X-chromosome inactivation. Our findings support a model for developmental gene regulation in which factors targeting proximal REs drive binary ON-OFF decisions, while factors interacting with distal REs control the transcription output.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Here we address these issues by network-based analysis of single cell transcriptomic profiles of pathophysiologically relevant human adult basal, ciliated and secretory cells to identify master regulator (MR) protein modules controlling their SARS-CoV-2-mediated reprogramming. This uncovered chromatin remodeling, endosomal sorting, ubiquitin pathway as well as proviral factors identified by CRISPR analyses as components of the host response collectively or selectively activated in these cells. Large-scale perturbation assays, using a clinically-relevant drug library, identified 11 drugs able to invert the entire MR signature activated by SARS-CoV-2 in these cell types. Leveraging MR analysis and perturbational profiles of human primary cells, represents a novel mechanism-based approach and resource that can be directly generalized to interrogate signatures of other airway conditions for drug prioritization.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

We found that enhancer annotation provides potential pathological insights into disease-associated copy number variants. More importantly, we discovered that allelic enhancer deletions at SIN3A could be compensated by increased transcriptional activities from the other intact allele. Such allelic compensation effects (ACE) on transcription is stably maintained during differentiation and, once established, cannot be reversed by ectopic SIN3A expression. Further, ACE at SIN3A occurs through dosage sensing by the promoter. Together, our findings unravel a regulatory compensation mechanism that ensures stable and precise transcriptional output for SIN3A, and potentially other dosage-sensitive genes.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

However, evidence on how these attentional templates is represented during preparation remains controversial. Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an orientation cueing task to isolate preparatory activity from stimulus-evoked responses. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found decodable information of the to-be-attended orientation during preparation; yet preparatory activity patterns were different from those evoked when actual orientations were perceived. When perturbing the neural activity by means of a visual impulse ( pinging technique), the preparatory activity patterns in visual cortex resembled those associated with perceiving these orientations. The observed differential patterns with and without the impulse perturbation suggest a predominantly non-sensory format and a latent, sensory-like format of representation during preparation. Furthermore, the emergence of the sensory-like template coincided with enhanced information connectivity between V1 and frontoparietal areas and was associated with improved behavioral performance. This dual-format mechanism suggests that during preparation the brain encodes more detailed template information beyond its immediate use, potentially providing advantages for adaptive attentional control. Consistent with recent theories of non-veridical,  good-enough attentional template for initial guidance, our findings established a neural basis for implementing two representational formats in different functional states during preparation: a predominantly non-sensory format for guidance and a latent sensory-like format for prospective stimulus processing.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Viral mimicry has been previously described to augment anti-tumor immune responses and sensitize solid tumors to immunotherapy including colorectal cancer, melanoma, and clear renal cell carcinoma. Here, we found that targeting a novel, master epigenetic regulator, Zinc Finger Protein 638 (ZNF638), induces viral mimicry in glioblastoma (GBM) preclinical models and potentiates immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). ZNF638 recruits the HUSH complex, which precipitates repressive H3K9me3 marks on endogenous REs. In GBM, ZNF638 is associated with marked locoregional immunosuppressive transcriptional signatures, reduced endogenous RE expression and poor immune cell infiltration (CD8+ T-cells, dendritic cells). ZNF638 knockdown decreased H3K9-trimethylation, increased cytosolic dsRNA and activated intracellular dsRNA-signaling cascades (RIG-I, MDA5 and IRF3). Furthermore, ZNF638 knockdown upregulated antiviral immune programs and significantly increased PD-L1 immune checkpoint expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres and diverse murine models. Importantly, targeting ZNF638 sensitized mice to ICI in syngeneic murine orthotopic models through innate interferon signaling. This response was recapitulated in recurrent GBM (rGBM) samples with radiographic responses to checkpoint inhibition with widely increased expression of dsRNA, PD-L1 and perivascular CD8 cell infiltration, suggesting dsRNA-signaling may mediate response to immunotherapy. Finally, we showed that low ZNF638 expression was a biomarker of clinical response to ICI and improved survival in rGBM patients and melanoma patients. Our findings suggest that ZNF638 could serve as a target to potentiate immunotherapy in gliomas.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Studying their propagation within single cortical areas has mostly been restricted to invasive measurements. Their investigation in healthy humans, however, requires non-invasive recordings, such as MEG or EEG. Identifying traveling waves with these techniques is challenging because source summation, volume conduction, and low signal-to-noise ratios make it difficult to localize cortical activity from sensor responses. The difficulty is compounded by the lack of a known ground truth in traveling wave experiments. Rather than source-localizing cortical responses from sensor activity, we developed a two-part model-based neuroimaging approach: (1) The putative neural sources of a propagating oscillation were modeled within primary visual cortex (V1) via retinotopic mapping from functional MRI recordings (encoding model); and (2) the modeled sources were projected onto MEG and EEG sensors to predict the resulting signal using a biophysical head model. We tested our model by comparing its predictions against the MEG-EEG signal obtained when participants viewed visual stimuli designed to elicit either fovea-to-periphery or periphery-to-fovea traveling waves or standing waves in V1, in which ground truth cortical waves could be reasonably assumed. Correlations on within-sensor phase and amplitude relations between predicted and measured data revealed good model performance. Crucially, the model predicted sensor data more accurately when the input to the model was a traveling wave going in the stimulus direction compared to when the input was a standing wave, or a traveling wave in a different direction. Furthermore, model accuracy peaked at the spatial and temporal frequency parameters of the visual stimulation. Together, our model successfully recovers traveling wave properties in cortex when they are induced by traveling waves in stimuli. This provides a sound basis for using MEG-EEG to study endogenous traveling waves in cortex and test hypothesis related with their role in cognition.

Author SummaryBrain oscillations, thought to be crucial for many cognitive processes, might actually be waves that travel across the brains surface. Understanding these traveling waves is notoriously difficult because current non-invasive methods like magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG-EEG) face significant technical limitations. To address this challenge, we developed a new approach that combines brain imaging techniques and computational modeling. We focused on the primary visual cortical area (V1) of the brain and created a model that simulates traveling activity across the cortex and predicts how these traveling waves should appear in EEG and MEG recordings. We tested our model by comparing its predictions with brain data collected when participants view visual patterns specifically designed to induce traveling waves in the visual system. The results show that our model accurately captures the direction and pattern of the traveling waves, as well as the specific parameters of the visual stimuli. This novel modeling tool offers a promising method for studying endogenous traveling waves and will enable neuroscientists to explore hypotheses about the spatiotemporal organization of brain activity and its role in cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Despite the central importance of signaling in biomedical research, our ability to quantify it in individual cells over time remains limited. Here, we introduce INSCRIBE, an approach for reconstructing signaling history in single cells using endpoint fluorescence images. By regulating a CRISPR base editor, INSCRIBE generates mutations in genomic target sequences, at a rate proportional to signaling activity. The number of edits is then recovered through a novel ratiometric readout strategy, from images of two fluorescence channels. We engineered human cell lines for recording WNT and BMP pathway activity, and demonstrated that INSCRIBE faithfully recovers both the intensity and duration of signaling. Further, we used INSCRIBE to study the variability of cellular response to WNT and BMP stimulation, and test whether the magnitude of response is a stable, heritable trait. We found a persistent memory in the BMP pathway. Progeny of cells with higher BMP response levels are likely to respond more strongly to a second BMP stimulation, up to 3 weeks later. Together, our results establish a scalable platform for genetic recording and in situ readout of signaling history in single cells, advancing quantitative analysis of cell-cell communication during development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Many proteins exert their functions through interactions with other proteins, and a significant challenge is designing these interactions effectively. While most efforts have focused on larger, more stable proteins, shorter peptides offer advantages such as lower manufacturing costs, reduced steric hindrance, and the ability to traverse cell membranes when cyclized. However, less structural data is available for peptides and their flexibility makes them harder to design. Here, we present a method to design both novel linear and cyclic peptide binders of varying lengths based solely on a protein target sequence.

Given the relatively small number of signaling pathways, the existence of multiple related ligands for many of these pathways is thought to represent a key evolutionary innovation for encoding complexity into cell-cell signaling. Relatedly, crosstalk and other interactions between pathways is another critical feature which allows a modest number pathways to ultimately generate an enormously diverse range of outcomes. It would thus be useful to have genetic tools to identify and manipulate not only those cells which express a given signaling ligand, but also those cells that specifically co-express pairs of signaling ligands. Here, we present a collection of split-Gal4 knock-in lines targeting many of the ligands for highly conserved signaling pathways in Drosophila (Notch, Hedgehog, FGF, EGF, TGF{beta}, JAK/STAT, JNK, and PVR). We demonstrate that these lines faithfully recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of their targets, and that they can be used to specifically identify the cells and tissues that co-express pairs of signaling ligands. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the 4th chromosome TGF{beta} ligands myoglianin and maverick are broadly co-expressed in muscles and other tissues of both larva and adults, and that the JAK/STAT ligands upd2 and upd3 are partially co-expressed from cells of the midgut following gut damage.

D. sechellia, a host specialist, feeds exclusively on a single fruit (Morinda citrifolia, noni) - the latter two are generalists living on various substrates. Using quantitative feeding assays, we recapitulate the preference for noni in D. sechellia and detect conserved sweet but altered bitter sensitivity via calcium imaging in peripheral taste neurons. Noni surprisingly activates bitter sensing neurons more strongly in D. sechellia due to a small deletion in one single gustatory receptor. Using volumetric calcium imaging in the ventral brain, we show that instead of peripheral physiology, species-specific processing of noni and sugar signals in sensorimotor circuits recapitulates differences in dietary preference. Our data support that peripheral receptor changes alone cannot explain altered food choice but rather modifications in how sensory information is transformed into feeding motor commands.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

This makes it easier to understand the hierarchy of these ontologies and how each sample in a dataset is classified within them, offering users a way to study the dataset at different taxonomic levels directly from the raw data. Additionally, the app implements the capability to create interactive networks, representing all experimental data to visualize the relationships between groups and ontologies without neglecting the established classification. This is a primary tool for understanding the meaning of the relationships observed within the displayed system.

Key features of Biofunctional includeO_LIInteractive visualization: Create and explore networks to visualize relationships between groups and ontologies.

However, many proteins and protein regions are intrinsically disordered (IDPs) and lack a stable fold i.e., the sequence of an IDP encodes a vast ensemble of spatial conformations that specify its biological function. This conformational plasticity and heterogeneity makes IDP design challenging. Here, we introduce a computational framework for de novo design of IDPs through rational and efficient inversion of molecular simulations that approximate the underlying sequence to ensemble relationship. We highlight the versatility of this approach by designing IDPs with diverse properties and arbitrary sequence constraints. These include IDPs with target ensemble dimensions, loops and linkers, highly sensitive sensors of physicochemical stimuli, and binders to target disordered substrates with distinct conformational biases. Overall, our method provides a general framework for designing sequence-ensemble-function relationships of biological macromolecules.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

We report genome-wide data from 248 ancient individuals from the largely unsampled period 100-800 CE and co-analyze them with previously reported data. In the Roman era, we document profound demographic transformation, with an influx of people with ancestry from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean in all the areas under study and of North Africans, especially in central and southern Iberia. Germanic (Buri, Suebi, Vandals & Visigoths) and Sarmatian (Alans) took over political control beginning in the 5th century, and although we identify individuals with Germanic-associated ancestry at sites with Germanic-style ornaments and observe that such individuals were closely related across large distances as in the case of two siblings separated by 700 km, for Iberia as a whole, we observe high continuity with the previous Hispano-Roman population. The demographic patterns in Iberia contrast sharply with those in Britain, which showed the opposite pattern of little change in the Roman period followed by great change in the Migration period, and also from demographic patterns in the central Mediterranean where both periods were associated with profound transformation, raising broader questions about the forces that precipitated change over this time.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

While small animals vocalize at higher pitch than large ones due to the smaller size of their vocal apparatus, the rules governing vocalization rhythms throughout the animal kingdom remain unknown. Vocal rhythms serve as a natural information parser, and one possibility is that they are constrained by the neural rhythms of transmitter and receiver, known to be relatively conserved across species and independent of their size. In this study, we quantified acoustic rhythms across taxa and investigated their evolutionary history with regard to phylogeny and selective pressure. In 98 species from six classes, we tested the main factors likely to influence their communication rhythms: morphology, physiology, social complexity, mastication and detectability. Phylogenetic modeling did not confirm the influence of these species-specific factors, but rather point to a scenario where acoustic communication rhythms have been maintained around an optimum at around 3Hz in the biological (neuronal) delta range (1-4Hz) well before the mammals split. These results suggest that the rhythm of acoustic communication signals, unlike their pitch, has a universal neural determinant that has been conserved throughout evolution, allowing for intra- and cross-species signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Here, we present BEREN, a comprehensive bioinformatic tool to unlock the diversity of these viruses in metagenomes through five modules for NCLDV genome, contig, and marker gene recovery, metabolic protein annotation, and Preplasmiviricota genome identification and annotation. BERENs performance was benchmarked against other mainstream virus recovery tools using a mock metagenome, demonstrating superior recovery rates of NCLDV contigs and Preplasmiviricota genomes. Applied to a real-world dataset from the Baltic Sea, BEREN identified diverse Bamfordvirae members, giving insight into viral interactions and metabolic functions in this region.

Current state-of-the-art models are primarily evaluated using two categories of in silico metrics: sequence-based metrics, such as amino acid recovery (AAR), and structure-based metrics, including root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), predicted alignment error (pAE), and interface predicted template modeling (ipTM). While metrics such as pAE and ipTM have been shown to be useful filters for experimental success, there is no evidence that they are suitable for ranking, particularly for antibody sequence designs. Furthermore, no reliable sequence-based metric for ranking has been established. In this work, using real-world experimental data from seven diverse datasets, we extensively benchmark a range of generative models, including LLM-style, diffusion-based, and graph-based models. We show that log-likelihood scores from these generative models correlate well with experi-mentally measured binding affinities, suggesting that log-likelihood can serve as a reliable metric for ranking antibody sequence designs.

Major bodies of ecological theory have emerged, largely independently, to address temperature and resource effects. It remains a major challenge to unite these ideas and determine the interactive effects of temperature and resources on ecological patterns and processes, and their consequences across ecological scales. Here, we propose a simple, physiologically motivated model capturing the interactive effects of temperature and resources (including inorganic nutrients and light) on the growth of microbial ectotherms over multiple ecological scales. From this model we derive a set of key predictions. At the population level, we predict (i) interactive effects of resource limitation on thermal traits, (ii) consistent differences in the temperature sensitivity of auto- and heterotrophs, and (iii) the existence of specific tradeoffs between traits that determine the shape of thermal performance curves. At the community level, we derive predictions for (iv) how limitation by nutrients and light can change the relationship between temperature and productivity. All four predictions are upheld, based on our analyses of a large compilation of laboratory data on microbial growth, as well as field experiments with marine phytoplankton communities. Collectively, our modeling framework provides a new way of thinking about the interplay between two fundamental aspects of life -- temperature and resources -- and how they constrain and structure ecological properties across scales. Providing links between population and community responses to simultaneous changes in abiotic factors is essential to anticipating the multifaceted effects of global change.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

A{beta}-Amyloid (A{beta}) and phosphorylated tau, pathologies usually found in Alzheimers Disease (AD), have also been implicated in PD, with over 50% of patients exhibited the co-expression of these proteins (co-pathologies). In both AD and PD postmortem tissue, neuroinflammation, the activation of microglia and resident macrophages and the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery, including T cells and monocytes, are drivers of neurodegeneration. However, how the co-expression of these pathologies contribute to the inflammatory response and overall neurodegenerative disease phenotype remains unknown. To understand how the co-expression of pathologies drives neuropathology, we developed a novel co-pathology model by stereotaxically injecting -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum, and AAV-doublemut tau virus into the entorhinal cortex, of 3-month-old J20 transgenic mice with A{beta} pathology. We analyzed immune cell populations in the brain and periphery at 3 months post-induction (3MPI). At 6MPI, neuronal loss in the hippocampus and substantia nigra pars compacta were assessed along with pathological protein deposition. At 3MPI, the co-pathology mouse model begins to exhibit enhanced pathology load in the cortex and hippocampus. There was a robust neuroinflammatory response in interconnected brain regions, including increased microglial cell number, changes in microglial activation markers, and infiltration of T cells. This was synergistic in the co-pathology model, compared to the individual models, supporting the hypothesis that these collectively may drive the progression of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

In the field of invertebrate acoustic communication, reconstructing the acoustic properties of sound-producing forewings in crickets has been based on two very divergent methods, finite element modelling (FEM) and vibrometric measurements from preserved specimens. Both methods, however, make strong simplifying assumptions which have not been tested and the reliability of inferences made from either method remains in question. Here we rigorously test and refine both reconstruction methods using the well-known Teleorgryllus oceanicus model system and determine the appropriate conditions required to reconstruct the vibroacoustic behaviour of male forewings. We find that when using FEM it is not necessary to assume simplified boundary conditions if the appropriate parameters are found. When using preserved specimens, we find that the sample needs to be rehydrated for reliable reconstruction, however, it may be possible to accomplish rehydration in silico using FEM. Our findings provide a refined methodology for the reliable reconstruction of cricket songs, whether from fossils or preserved specimens from museums or field collections.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Here, we identify and functionally characterize a specific projection from the nucleus accumbens (ACB) that targets Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons. Using cell-type-specific tracing of monosynaptic inputs, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and neuroanatomical mapping, we demonstrate that the Esr1+ LHA-LHb pathway receives a major input from a striosomal Tac1+/Tshz1+/Oprm1+ ACB neuron subtype. Intersectional cell-type-specific and input-output defined optogenetic manipulation of this ACB-LHA-LHb pathway revealed its role in signaling aversion after repeated activation, with the negative behavioral state being dependent on recruitment of Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons. Importantly, we found that activation of the D1+ ACB-LHA pathway drives reward-independent compulsive-like seeking behaviors, expressed as compulsive digging or poking behaviors. We found that these complex yet stereotyped behaviors compete with highly motivated states and can override the need for natural rewards or social stimuli.

Using two-photon or widefield imaging (hippocampus, neocortex), field potential and single unit recordings, and behavioral assessment in mice, we first studied seizures during viral encephalitis, and subsequently established an optogenetic approach to dissociate hippocampal seizures and SD. We find region-specific occurrence of sSD that displays distinct spatial trajectories to preceding seizures, and show that seizure-related and isolated hippocampal SD prompt post-ictal wandering. This clinically relevant locomotor phenotype occurred in the absence of hippocampal SD progression to the neocortex. Finally, we confirm sSD existence in human epilepsy, in a patient cohort with refractory focal epilepsy, via Behnke-Fried electrode recordings. In this cohort, sSD displayed a similar temporomesial propensity as in mice. This work uncovers sSD as a previously underrecognized pathoclinical entity underlying postictal behavioral abnormalities in epilepsy.

This approach not only clusters samples by their multi-omic profiles but also identifies latent factors across each omics dataset, thereby enabling interpretation of the underlying features contributing to each cluster. Consequently, GAUDI facilitates more intuitive, interpretable visualizations to identify novel insights and potential biomarkers from a wide range of experimental designs.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1729030179562

Despite its importance in human development, gastrulation remains difficult to study. Stem cell-based embryo models, including those that recapitulate different aspects of pre- and peri-gastrulation human development5-15, are emerging as promising tools for studying human embryogenesis16-18. However, it remains unclear whether existing human embryo models are capable of modeling the development of the trilaminar embryonic disc structure, a hallmark of human gastrulation. Here we report a transgene-free human embryo model derived solely from primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which recapitulates various aspects of peri-gastrulation human development, including formation of trilaminar embryonic layers situated between dorsal amnion and ventral definitive yolk sac and primary hematopoiesis. We term this model the peri-gastrulation trilaminar embryonic disc (PTED) embryoid. The development of PTED embryoid does not follow natural developmental sequences of cell lineage diversification or spatial organization. Instead, it exploits both extrinsic control of tissue boundaries and intrinsic self-organizing properties and embryonic plasticity of the diverse peri-gastrulation-stage cell lineages, leading to the emergence of in vivo-like tissue organization and function at a global scale. Our lineage tracing study reveals that in PTED embryoids, embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm cells, as well as embryonic and extraembryonic endoderm cells, share common progenitors emerging during peri-gastrulation development. Active hematopoiesis and blood cell generation are evident in the yolk sac-like structure of PTED embryoids. Together, PTED embryoids provide a promising and ethically less challenging model for studying self-organizing properties of peri-gastrulation human development.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

In this study, we introduce  oncoembryology, an approach that systematically compares embryonic and cancerous tissues to identify shared molecular programs and assess their functional relevance in disease. Applying this strategy to colorectal cancer, we identified SoxC transcription factors (Sox4, Sox11, Sox12) as critical regulators of both embryonic development and tumorigenesis. SoxC transcription factors regulate diverse downstream targets, including Tead2, Mdk, and Klf4, thereby regulating crucial steps of colon development. Abrogating SoxC function in murine models reduced tumor growth and prevented liver metastasis. Concordantly, a SoxC-driven oncoembryonic gene signature correlated with poor survival in colorectal cancer patients, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting SoxC-regulated pathways in cancer treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Recent studies have reported robust associations between sleep disturbance and various brain structural and functional traits. However, the complex interplay between sleep health and macro-scale brain organization remains inconclusive. In this study, we aimed to uncover the links between brain imaging features and diverse sleep health-related characteristics by means of Machine Learning (ML). Methods: We used 28,088 participants from the UK Biobank to calculate 4677 structural and functional neuroimaging markers. Then, we employed them to predict self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, easiness getting up in the morning, chronotype, daily nap, daytime sleepiness, and snoring. We built seven different linear and nonlinear ML models for each sleep health-related characteristic to assess their predictability. Results: We performed an extensive ML analysis that involved more than 100,000 hours of computing. We observed relatively low performance in predicting all sleep health-related characteristics (e.g., balanced accuracy ranging between 0.50-0.59). Across all models, the best performance achieved was 0.59, using a Linear SVM to predict easiness getting up in the morning. Conclusions: The low capability of multimodal neuroimaging markers in predicting sleep health-related characteristics, even under extensive ML optimization in a large population sample suggests a complex relationship between sleep health and brain organization.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Detailed, high-quality observations of when plants undergo seasonal transitions such as leaf-out, flowering, and fruiting are critical for tracking causes and consequences of phenology shifts, but these data are often sparse and biased globally. These data gaps limit broader generalizations and forecasting improvements in the face of continuing disturbance. One solution to closing such gaps is to document phenology on field images taken by public participants. iNaturalist, in particular, provides global scale research-grade data and is expanding rapidly. Here we utilize over 53 million field images of plants and millions of human annotations from iNaturalist-data spanning all angiosperms and drawn from across the globe - to train a computer vision model (PhenoVision) to detect the presence of fruits and flowers. PhenoVision utilizes a vision transformer architecture pretrained with a masked autoencoder to improve classification success, and it achieves high accuracy for flower (98.5%) and fruit presence (95%). Key to producing research-ready phenology data is post-calibration tuning and validation focused on reducing noise inherent in field photographs, and maximizing the true positive rate. We also develop a standardized set of quality metrics and metadata so that results can be used effectively by the community. Finally, we showcase how this effort vastly increases phenology data coverage, including regions of the globe where data have been limited before. Our end products are tuned models, new data resources, and an application streamlining discovery and use of those data for the broader research and management community. We close by discussing next steps, including automating phenology annotations, adding new phenology targets, e.g., leaf phenology, and further integration with other resources to form a global central database integrating all in-situ plant phenology resources.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Gs-coupled GPCRs are thought to achieve this by internalizing and allosterically activating cognate G proteins again on the endosome membrane. Here we demonstrate that the -opioid receptor (MOR), a Gi-coupled GPCR, increases endosomal G protein activity in a different way. Leveraging conformational biosensors, we resolve the subcellular activation dynamics of endogenously expressed MOR and Gi/o-subclass G proteins. We show that MOR activation triggers a transient increase of active-state Gi/o on the plasma membrane that is followed by a prolonged increase on endosomes. Contrary to the Gs-coupled GPCR paradigm, however, we show that the MOR-induced increase of active-state Gi/o on endosomes requires neither internalization of MOR nor activation of MOR in the endosome membrane. We propose a distinct and additional cellular mechanism for GPCR-triggered elevation of G protein activity on endosomes that is mediated by regulated trafficking of the activated G protein rather than its activating GPCR.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central tenets of medical entomology. Here, we show that male Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder when reared under dehydration conditions with no toxic effects. Mosquitoes with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates when dehydrated compared to wild-type controls. While conventionally reared males ignore a human host, dehydrated males are attracted to and attempt to probe, with some success, although they cannot access host capillaries. However, they will take blood from a vertebrate host wound. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male mosquitoes can become infected with and orally transmit the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. These data suggest that under some circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, and that their role in maintaining pathogen transmission cycles should be re-examined.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

In this study, we describe our approach for designing stable mRNA molecules by combining machine learning-driven sequence design with high-throughput experimental assays. We developed a high-throughput massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that, in a single experiment, measures the half-life of tens of thousands of unique mRNA sequences containing designed 3 UTRs. Over multiple design-build-test iterations, we have accumulated 180,000 unique measurements of mRNA stability covering unique genomic and synthetic 3 UTRs, representing the largest such dataset of sequences. We trained highly-accurate machine learning models to map from 3 UTR sequence to mRNA stability, and used them to guide the design of synthetic 3 UTRs that increase mRNA stability in cell lines. Finally, we validated the function of several ML-designed 3 UTRs in mouse models, resulting in up to 2-fold more protein production over time and 30-100-fold higher protein output at later time points compared to a commonly used benchmark. These results highlight the potential of ML-driven sequence design for mRNA therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179562

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1729030179562

However, little is known about how this drug alters large-scale brain activity. We collected naturalistic electroencephalography (EEG) data of 29 healthy individuals before and after inhaling a high dose (12mg) of vaporised synthetic 5-MeO-DMT. We replicate work from rodents showing amplified low-frequency oscillations, but extend these findings with novel tools for characterising the organisation and dynamics of complex low-frequency spatiotemporal fields of neural activity. We find that 5-MeO-DMT radically reorganises low-frequency flows of neural activity, causing them to become incoherent, heterogeneous, viscous, fleeting, nonrecurring, and to cease their typical travelling forwards and backwards across the cortex compared to resting state. Further, we find a consequence of this reorganisation in broadband activity, which exhibits slower, more stable, low-dimensional behaviour, with increased energy barriers to rapid global shifts. These findings provide the first detailed empirical account of how 5-MeO-DMT sculpts human brain dynamics, revealing a novel set of cortical slow wave behaviours, with significant implications for extant neuroscientific models of serotonergic psychedelics.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCEs embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

While traditionally viewed as a waste product, lactate is an important energy source for many organs, but first must be oxidized to pyruvate for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). This reaction is thought to occur in the cytosol, with pyruvate subsequently transported into mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Using 13C stable isotope tracing, we demonstrated that lactate is oxidized in the myocardial tissue of mice even when the MPC is genetically deleted. This MPC-independent lactate import and mitochondrial oxidation is dependent upon the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1/Slc16a1). Mitochondria isolated from the myocardium without MCT1 exhibit a specific defect in mitochondrial lactate, but not pyruvate, metabolism. The import and subsequent mitochondrial oxidation of lactate by mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) acts as an electron shuttle, generating sufficient NADH to support respiration even when the TCA cycle is disrupted. In response to diverse cardiac insults, animals with hearts lacking MCT1 undergo rapid progression to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Thus, the mitochondrial import and oxidation of lactate enables carbohydrate entry into the TCA cycle to sustain cardiac energetics and maintain myocardial structure and function under stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

Here, we address this gap using radiotelemetry to track social interactions in a population of wild mice over 10 years, from 2013 to 2023, and interpret these interactions in the context of passive acoustic monitoring data collected from August 2022 until November 2023. Using deep convolutional neural networks, we identify 1.3 million individual vocalizations and align them in time with continuously collected telemetry data recording social interactions between individually identifiable mice. We find that vocalization is seasonal and correlated with long-term dynamics in features of social groups. In addition, we find that vocalization is closely associated in time with entrances to and exits from those groups, occurs most often in the presence of pups, and is correlated with how much time pairs of mice spend together. This work identifies seasonal patterns in the vocalizations of wild mice and lays a foundation to investigate the social role of acoustic communication in wild populations of a classic laboratory model organism.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

However, many eukaryotic viruses, including amoeba-infecting mimiviruses, have codon usage that is largely deviated from that of their host, despite using the host machinery for translation. This raises the question of how these viruses cope with the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand. Here we show that Acanthamoeba castellanii mimivirus generates a subcellular area in the host cells to translate virus mRNAs. A combination of genome-wide ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing showed that ribosomes traversed along viral mRNAs with fewer pausing events than were observed on amoeba mRNAs. Frequently used codons in viral mRNAs had higher tRNA accessibility than the same type of codons in amoeba mRNAs. tRNA sequencing showed that the tRNA pool was not greatly altered during the infection even though the virus encodes tRNA genes. Instead, by in situ labelling, we found that viral mRNAs and newly synthesized proteins were localized at the periphery region of the viral factory, likely creating a unique environment to facilitate viral translation. Our data provide a perspective on how local translation assists the virus in overcoming the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

Although commensal bacteria display host preference, their beneficial impact on their cognate host and mechanisms of species selection by the plant are still unclear. We use bacterial culture collections derived from the two model species Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and Lotus japonicus (Lj) to design synthetic communities (SynComs) and test their protective function upon exposure of At Col-0 to the detrimental root-colonizing Pseudomonas isolate R401. Lj-derived SynComs were fully protective, whereas At-derived SynComs displayed full protective activity only towards a R401 mutant impaired in the production of inhibitory exometabolites. The protective phenotypes were associated with a reduced titer of the R401 opportunistic pathogen. In vitro antagonist assays, in planta and in vitro bacterial community profiling, as well as strain-swapping and strain-dropout experiments revealed that competition among commensal Pseudomonas strains and R401 determines the success of the opportunist, independent of the original host or the phylogeny of the commensals. Furthermore, we determine the carbon utilization potential of these isolates, which may explain the competition with the detrimental strain and the role of host-secreted compounds. Our results provide evidence that intra-genus interactions within SynComs modulate plant health and disease, and that an individual beneficial strain can be sufficient to outcompete an opportunistic relative. This has implications for the successful development of beneficial microbial consortia for agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

Despite this, no studies have employed proteomics to characterize host immune responses to severe pediatric vLRTI in both the lower airway and systemic circulation. To address this gap, gain insights into vLRTI pathophysiology, and test a novel diagnostic approach, we assayed 1,305 proteins in tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma from 62 critically ill children using SomaScan. We performed differential expression (DE) and pathway analyses comparing vLRTI (n=40) to controls with non-infectious acute respiratory failure (n=22), developed a diagnostic classifier using LASSO regression, and analyzed matched TA and plasma samples. We further investigated the impact of viral load and bacterial coinfection on the proteome. The TA signature of vLRTI was characterized by 200 DE proteins (Padj<0.05) with upregulation of interferons and T cell responses and downregulation of inflammation-modulating proteins including FABP and MIP-5. A nine-protein TA classifier achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.90-1.00) for identifying vLRTI. In plasma, the host response to vLRTI was more muted with 56 DE proteins. Correlation between TA and plasma was limited, although ISG15 was elevated in both compartments. In bacterial coinfection, we observed increases in the TNF-stimulated protein TSG-6, as well as CRP, and interferon-related proteins. Viral load correlated positively with interferon signaling and negatively with neutrophil-activation pathways. Taken together, our study provides fresh insight into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI, and identifies novel protein biomarkers with diagnostic potential.

IMPORTANCEWe describe the first proteomic profiling of the lower airway and blood in critically ill children with severe viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI). From tracheal aspirate (TA), we defined a proteomic signature of vLRTI characterized by increased expression of interferon signaling proteins and decreased expression of proteins involved in immune modulation including FABP and MIP-5. Using machine learning, we developed a parsimonious diagnostic classifier that distinguished vLRTI from non-infectious respiratory failure with high accuracy. Comparative analysis of paired TA and plasma specimens demonstrated limited concordance, although the interferon-stimulated protein ISG15 was significantly upregulated with vLRTI in both compartments. We further identified TSG-6 and CRP as airway biomarkers of bacterial-viral coinfection, and viral load analyses demonstrated positive correlation with interferon-related protein expression and negative correlation with the expression of neutrophil activation proteins. Taken together, our study provides new insight into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

Attachment of phages to bacterial cells is a crucial initial step of the interaction. The classic assay to quantify the dynamics of phage attachment involves co-culturing and enumeration of bacteria and phages, which is laborious, lengthy, hence low-throughput, and only provides ensemble estimates of model-based adsorption rate constants. Here, we utilized fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking to obtain trajectories of individual virus particles interacting with cells. The trajectory durations quantified the heterogeneity in dwell time, the time that each phage spends interacting with a bacterium. The average dwell time strongly correlated with the classically-measured adsorption rate constant. We successfully applied this technique to quantify host-attachment dynamics of several phages including those targeting key bacterial pathogens. This approach should benefit the field of phage biology by providing highly quantitative, model-free readouts at single-virus resolution, helping to uncover single-virus phenomena missed by traditional measurements. Owing to significant reduction in manual effort, our method should enable rapid, high-throughput screening of a phage library against a target bacterial strain for applications such as therapy or diagnosis.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

Nonetheless, these are often examined at the individual level, while societal-environmental exposures and their association with anxiety disorders are under-researched, especially in the Israeli context. This study leverages 19 years of longitudinal data from a large healthcare organization to examine the impact of national security instability on short-term anxiolytic purchases in Israel.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records of over 1.1 million individuals from 2006 to 2024, examining rates of first-time and renewed use of anxiolytic medications of the benzodiazepines group during periods of armed conflict, including military operations and wars. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations, adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, socioreligious sector, residence and previous psychiatric treatment.

ResultsThe risk for first purchase of an anxiety-relief short terms medication during military operations was 28% higher (HR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.21-1.34) compared to periods of relative national stability, after adjustments, and 44% higher during the Second Lebanon War (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27-1.62). The events of October 7th were the most significant armed conflict increasing the risk for anxiety-related reaction necessitating treatment throughout the 19-years follow-up, with individuals at 317% increased risk for treatment initiation compared to periods of relative national stability (HR 4.17, 95% CI 3.97-4.38). Alongside a baseline increased risk for initiating anti-anxiety treatment, women experienced an additional elevated risk for anxiolytic therapy during times of national security threats, with 26% additional increased risk during military operations and an 81% increased risk following the events of October 7th. Residents of northern Israel had an increased risk of purchasing anxiolytics during the Second Lebanon War (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.12-1.72), while during military operations it was the residents of southern Israel who faced an increased risk for anxiolytic usage, with an HR of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05-1.33). Conversely, the residential region did not significantly influence anti-anxiety treatment patterns following October 7th among residents of southern or northern Israel, compared to individuals living in central Israel, indicating a broader national impact beyond regional differences.

ConclusionsNational armed conflicts significantly influence anxiolytic medication use in Israel, with the October 7th war showing the most pronounced effect. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive mental health interventions during times of national crisis, focusing on both short-term relief and long-term mental health support to prevent dependency and improve mental health outcomes in the wake of national crises.","NA","medrxiv",1729030179563

Because interareal alpha synchrony is thought to facilitate long-range communication in healthy brains, coherence measures of resting-state alpha oscillations may provide insights into a patients capacity for higher-order cognition beyond channel-wise estimates of alpha power. In multi-channel EEG, global coherence methods may be used to augment standard spectral analysis methods by both estimating the strength and identifying the structure of coherent oscillatory networks. We performed global coherence analysis in 95 separate clinical EEG recordings (28 healthy controls and 33 patients with acute or chronic DoC, 25 of whom returned for follow-up) collected between two academic medical centers. We found that posterior alpha coherence is associated with recovery of higher-level cognition. We developed a measure of network organization, based on the distance between eigenvectors of the alpha cross-spectral matrix, that detects recovery of posterior alpha networks. In patients who have emerged from a minimally conscious state, we showed that coherence-based alpha networks are reconfigured prior to restoration of alpha power to resemble those seen in healthy controls. This alpha network measure performs well in classifying recovery from DoC (AUC = 0.78) compared to common representations of functional connectivity using the weighted phase lag index (AUC = 0.50 - 0.57). Lastly, we observed that activity within these alpha networks is suppressed during positive responses to task-based EEG command-following paradigms, supporting the potential utility of this biomarker to detect covert cognition. Our findings suggest that restored alpha networks may represent a sensitive early signature of cognitive recovery in patients with DoC. Therefore, network detection methods may augment the utility of EEG assessments for DoC.","NA","medrxiv",1729030179563

These sequences, known as spacers, are inserted into the CRISPR locus by the Cas1-Cas2 integrase complex and mediate sequence- specific immunity in prokaryotes. Spacer acquisition has been used to develop unique biotechnological applications such as the immunization of industrially relevant bacteria against bacteriophage infection and the recording of biological signals into stable genetic information. These technologies, however, are constrained by the low efficiency of the spacer acquisition process. To overcome this limitation, we developed a genetic system that combined deep mutational scanning (DMS) of cas genes from the Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A CRISPR- Cas system with a method that selects bacteria that acquire new spacers. This procedure enabled the identification of cas mutations that support up to a sevenfold increase in the levels of spacer acquisition and a significant enhancement of immunity against phage infection. In addition, our analysis revealed key interactions at the Cas1-Cas2 interface critical for spacer integration. Our findings provide insights into the molecular determinants of spacer acquisition and offer a platform to improve CRISPR-Cas-based applications.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1729030179563

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

Leveraging transcriptomics and proteomics imaging platforms, STAMP eliminates sequencing costs, to enable single-cell genomics from hundreds to millions of cells at an unprecedented low cost. Stamping cells in suspension onto imaging slides, STAMP supports single-modal (RNA or protein) and multimodal (RNA and protein) profiling and flexible, ultra-high-throughput formats. STAMP allows the analysis of a single or multiple samples within the same experiment, enhancing experimental flexibility, throughput and scale. We tested STAMP with diverse sample types, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), dissociated cancer cells and differentiated embryonic stem cell cultures, as well as whole cells and nuclei. Combining RNA and protein profiling, we applied immuno-phenotyping of millions of blood cells simultaneously. We also used STAMP to identify ultra-rare cell populations, simulating clinical applications to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Performing in vitro differentiation studies, we further showed its potential for large-scale perturbation studies. Together, STAMP establishes a new standard for cost-effective, scalable single-cell analysis. Without the need for sequencing, STAMP makes high-resolution profiling more affordable and accessible. Designed to meet the needs of research labs, diagnostic cores and pharmaceutical companies, STAMP holds the promise to transform our capacity to map human biology, diagnose diseases and drug discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

ObjectiveThis SLR summarizes the evidence across studies among predominately adults that report an adjusted measure of association for the relationship between vaccination and PCC, by timing of vaccination relative to infection or PCC-onset and across different study characteristics.

Evidence reviewA comprehensive search strategy was developed within the OVID platform across EMBASE, MEDLINE(R) and Evidence-Based Medicine reviews, and supplemented with WHO COVID library and Google Scholar(R) searches, to collate evidence on vaccination and PCC published or posted as pre-prints between January 1st, 2020 and July 18th, 2023. JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists were used to assess each studys risk of bias.

FindingsThis review included 97 studies and synthesized results from 56 studies with low risk of bias that reported adjusted measures for the association between vaccination and PCC. Overall, 77% of pre-infection adjusted VE (aVE) estimates (vs. unvaccinated) were statistically significant (range: 7%-95%), 80% of estimates reflecting a mix of those vaccinated before and after infection were statistically significant (range: 62%-73%), one of five estimates reflecting vaccination after PCC onset was statistically significant (aVE=41%), 43% of post-infection vaccination estimates were statistically significant (two were protective [range: 28%-40%] and one was not [aVE=-47%]), and 46% of estimates not specifying vaccination timing were statistically significant (23 were protective [range: 29%-75%] and one was not [aVE=-132%]). Statistically significant pre-infection aVE estimates were slightly higher for mRNA (range: 14%-84%) than non-mRNA vaccines (range: 16%-38%) and aVE ranges during (4 studies; range: 10%-70%) and before Omicron predominance (10 studies; range: 7%-50%) overlapped. Pre-infection vaccination was protective regardless of vaccine type, number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant variant, and severity of acute infections included.

Conclusions and RelevanceCollectively our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination received prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces the subsequent risk of developing PCC regardless of the predominant variant circulating.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo measures of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC) vary by timing of vaccine relative to SARS-CoV-2 infection or PCC onset, vaccine type and number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, and disease severity?

FindingsCOVID-19 vaccination before SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to reduce the risk of PCC (vs. unvaccinated). Compared with other COVID-19 vaccine types, mRNA vaccines seemed to offer greater protection, and a dose response was observed for mRNA vaccines.

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements.

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

TEs are epigenetically silenced to prevent harmful effects caused by either global activation leading to genome instability or insertional mutation disturbing gene transcription. However, whether the activation of a single element can contribute to pathological phenotypes without directly affecting gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we show that tissue-specific expression of a TE in the embryo leads to the production of viral-like particles (VLPs) which can affect organ formation. Failure to silence an LTR retrotransposon inserted upstream of the Fgf8 gene results in its co-expression with Fgf8 in the developing embryo. While local gene regulation is unaffected, the LTR retrotransposon participates in chromatin folding at the locus and adopts the expression of the regulatory domain it is located in. This drives the production of VLPs in the Fgf8-expressing cells of the developing limb, triggering apoptotic cell death at the time of digit outgrowth and resulting in a limb malformation resembling human ectrodactyly. This phenotype can be rescued by knock-out or knock-in of the retrotransposon causing mutations preventing its full retroviral cycle. Insertion of the same element at other developmental loci faithfully recapitulates expression according to the neighboring regulatory activity. Our findings provide a mechanism by which TE insertion is incorporated into the local genomic regulatory landscape and show how VLP production in post-implantation embryos can interfere with organ formation.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729030179563

Fluorescent HaloTag ligands employed in sequential labeling led to the discovery of distinct protein variants for histones, cohesins, and MCM complexes. Nonetheless, an efficient biochemical approach to separate the distinct protein variants to study their biological functions is missing. Principally being a gap in technology, the HaloTag toolbox lacks affinity ligands displaying good cell permeability and efficient affinity capture. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and validation of a new cell-permeable Biotin-HaloTag ligand, which allows rapid labeling of Halo-tagged proteins in live cells and their efficient separation using streptavidin pull-down. Our work outlines how to use the herein-developed affinity ligand in sequential labeling to biochemically separate distinct protein variants and study their biological properties. The approach holds immense potential for addressing fundamental questions concerning essential cellular processes, including genome duplication and chromatin maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1729030179563
