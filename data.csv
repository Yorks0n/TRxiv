Current methods, including PCR and rapid antigen tests (RAT), have limitations in speed, sensitivity, and the requirement for specialized equipment and trained personnel. Nanotechnology, particularly upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), offer a promising alternative due to their unique optical properties. UCNPs can convert low-energy near-infrared (NIR) light into higher-energy visible light, making them ideal for use as optical probes in single molecule detection and point of care applications. This study, initiated in early 2020, explores the opportunity of using highly doped UCNPs (40%Yb3+/4%Er3+) in lateral flow assay (LFA) for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. The UCNPs-based LFA testing demonstrated a minimum detection concentration of 100 pg/mL for SARS-CoV-2 antigen and 105 CCID50/mL for inactivated virus. Clinical trials, conducted in Malaysia and Western Australia independently, showed that the technique was at least 100 times more sensitive than commercial RAT kits, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91.34%. The development process involved multidisciplinary collaborations, resulting in the Virulizer device, an automated strip reader for point-of-care testing. This work sets a reference for future development of highly sensitive and quantitative rapid antigen tests, aiming for the Limits of Detection (LoD) in the range of sub-ng/mL.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1723068378888

Immunotherapies specifically are ineffective in pancreatic cancer, in part due to its unique stromal and immune microenvironment. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or PanIN, is the main precursor lesion to PDAC. Recently it was discovered that PanINs are remarkably abundant in the grossly normal pancreas, suggesting that the vast majority will never progress to cancer. Here, through construction of 48 samples of cm3-sized human pancreas tissue, we profiled the immune microenvironment of 1,476 PanINs in 3D and at single-cell resolution to better understand the early evolution of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment and to determine how inflammation may play a role in cancer progression. We found that bulk pancreatic inflammation strongly correlates to PanIN cell fraction. We found that the immune response around PanINs is highly heterogeneous, with distinct immune hotspots and cold spots that appear and disappear in a span of tens of microns. Immune hotspots generally mark locations of higher grade of dysplasia or locations near acinar atrophy. The immune composition at these hotspots is dominated by naive, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells, cancer associated fibroblasts, and tumor associated macrophages, with little similarity to the immune composition around less-inflamed PanINs. By mapping FOXP3+ cells in 3D, we found that regulatory T cells are present at higher density in larger PanIN lesions compared to smaller PanINs, suggesting that the early initiation of PanINs may not exhibit an immunosuppressive response. This analysis demonstrates that while PanINs are common in the pancreases of most individuals, inflammation may play a pivotal role, both at the bulk and the microscopic scale, in demarcating regions of significance in cancer progression.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

However, these conclusions often stem from analyses of individual loci, and genome-wide studies exploring mechanistic differences with coupled gene expression are lacking. In this study, we dissected the proinflammatory gene expression program induced by TNF in primary human endothelial cells using NGS- and imaging-based techniques. Our findings, enabled by our novel RWireX approach for single-cell ATAC-seq analysis, revealed two distinct regulatory chromatin modules: autonomous links of co-accessibility (ACs) between separated sites, and domains of contiguous co-accessibility (DCs) with increased local transcription factor binding. Genes in ACs and DCs exhibited different transcriptional bursting kinetics, highlighting the existence of two structurally and functionally distinct regulatory chromatin modules in the proinflammatory response. These findings provide a novel mechanistic framework for understanding how cells achieve rapid and precise gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1723068378888

From this family, we estimate an average of 192 DNMs per generation, including 75.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 79.6 de novo indels or structural variants (SVs) originating from tandem repeats, 7.7 centromeric de novo SVs and SNVs, and 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. STRs and VNTRs are the most mutable with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations, documenting de novo SVs, and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length, and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75-81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 17% of de novo SNVs are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map ([~]3.5 kbp breakpoint resolution). We observe a strong maternal recombination bias (1.36 maternal:paternal ratio) with a consistent reduction in the number of crossovers with increasing paternal (r=0.85) and maternal (r=0.65) age. However, we observe no correlation between meiotic crossover locations and de novo SVs, arguing against non-allelic homologous recombination as a predominant mechanism. The use of multiple orthogonal technologies, near-telomere-to-telomere phased genome assemblies, and a multi-generation family to assess transmission has created the most comprehensive, publicly available ""truth set"" of all classes of genomic variants.

However, it remains unclear whether migrating cells can retain a memory of their past morphological states, which could potentially enhance their navigation through confined spaces. By combining cell migration assays on standardized microsystems with biophysical modeling and biochemical perturbations, we demonstrate that local geometry governs these morphological switches, thereby facilitating cell passage through long and narrow gaps. We uncovered a long-term memory of past confinement events in migrating cells, with morphological states correlated across transitions through actin cortex remodeling. These findings suggest that mechanical memory in migrating cells plays an active role in their migratory potential in confined environments.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1723068378888

Despite recent advances, their specificity remains incompletely understood. Here, we address this by contrasting two TFs, NGN2 and MyoD1, which recognize ubiquitous E-box motifs yet instigate distinct cell fates--neurons and muscles, respectively. Following controlled induction in embryonic stem cells, we monitor binding across differentiation trajectories, employing an interpretable machine-learning approach integrating pre-existing DNA accessibility data. This reveals a chromatin-dependent motif syntax, delineating both common and factor-specific binding and predicting genome engagement with high precision. Shared binding sites reside in open chromatin, locally influenced by nucleosomes. In contrast, factor-specific binding in closed chromatin involves NGN2 and MyoD1 acting as pioneer-factors, influenced by multi-motifs, rotational spacing, flanking sequences, and specific interaction partners, accounting for subsequent lineage divergence. Extending our methodology to other models demonstrates how such combination of opportunistic-binding and context-specific chromatin opening underpin transcription factor specificity driving differentiation trajectories.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Herein, we developed a highly modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) including TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a adjuvants and their mixtures. These various TLRa-SNP adjuvant constructs induce unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention.

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

HighlightsPromoter editing generates unimodal setpoints from a single synthetic promoter

In vitro, SADS-CoV can infect cell lines from many different species, including humans, highlighting its high zoonotic potential. Coronavirus spike glycoproteins play a critical role in viral entry and are involved in determining viral host range and cellular tropism. Here, we used experimental evolution to investigate how the SADS-CoV spike protein adapts to human cells and to identify potential variants with increased infectivity. We evolved a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the SADS-CoV spike (rVSV-SADS) in three human cell lines. After ten passages, increased viral replication was observed, and spike mutations were identified by sequencing. Mutations were functionally characterized in terms of viral fitness, spike processing and fusogenicity. Our results thus identify potential human-adaptive mutations in the SADS-CoV spike that may further enhance its zoonotic potential.

ImportanceCoronavirus transmission from animals represents a serious threat to humans. Pigs are of particular concern because of their proximity to humans and the several coronaviruses they harbor. In particular, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a recently identified highly pathogenic porcine coronavirus that has a very broad tropism in vitro, highlighting its high zoonotic risk. The coronavirus spike protein is a strong determinant of species tropism, and spike mutations may facilitate cross-species transmission. Here, to identify potential variants with increased ability to enter human cells, we used an experimental evolution approach to study how the SADS-CoV spike adapts to different human cell lines. These mutations, should they occur in nature, could potentially increase the zoonotic potential of SADS-CoV.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Through most of its range, this frog is red with blue limbs. However, frogs from the Bocas del Toro Province, Panama, show striking variance in color and pattern, both sympatrically and allopatrically. This observation contradicts standard models of the evolution of aposematism and has led to substantial speculation about its evolutionary and molecular causes. Since the enigma of O. pumilio phenotypic variation is partly unresolved because of its large, ~ 6.7 Gb genome, we here sequence exomes from 347 individuals from ten populations and map a number of genetic factors responsible for the color and pattern variation. The kit gene is the primary candidate underlying the blue-red polymorphism in Dolphin Bay, where an increase in melanosomes is correlated with blue coloration. Additionally, the ttc39b gene, a known enhancer of yellow-to-red carotenoid conversion in birds, is the primary factor behind the yellow-red polymorphism in the Bastimentos West area. The causal genetic regions show evidence of selective sweeps acting locally to spread the rare phenotype. Our analyses suggest an evolutionary model in which selection is driving the formation of new morphs in a dynamic system resulting from a trade-off between predation avoidance, intraspecific competition, and mate choice.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

However, the sequence codes and mechanisms underpinning post-transcriptional regulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we revisit the finding from a prior massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that AU-rich (U-rich) elements in 3 untranslated regions (3 UTRs) can drive upregulation or downregulation of mRNA expression depending on 3 UTR context. We unexpectedly discover that this variable regulation arises from widespread cryptic splicing, predominately from an unannotated splice donor in the coding sequence of GFP to diverse acceptor sites in reporter 3 UTRs. Splicing is activated by U-rich sequences, which function as potent position-dependent regulators of 5 and 3 splice site choice and overall splicing efficiency. Splicing has diverse impacts on reporter expression, causing both increases and decreases in reporter expression via multiple mechanisms. We further provide evidence that cryptic splicing impacts between 10 to 50% of measurements made by other published 3 UTR MPRAs. Overall, our work emphasizes U-rich sequences as principal drivers of splicing and provides strategies to minimize cryptic splicing artifacts in reporter assays.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Yet, the relationships of living holocephalians to their extinct relatives and the timescale of diversification of living species remains unclear. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of holocephalians using comprehensive morphological and DNA sequence datasets. Our results suggest that living holocephalians entered and diversified in deep (>1000 m) ocean waters after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction, contrasting with the hypothesis that this ecosystem has acted as a refugium of ancient cartilaginous fishes. These invasions were decoupled from the evolution of key features of the holocephalian body plan, including crushing dentition, a single frontal clasper, and holostylic jaw suspension, in the Paleozoic Era, and considerably postdated the appearance of the living familes by 150 million years ago during a major period of biotic turnover in oceans termed the Mesozoic Marine Revolution.

A DFE is typically estimated by fitting an observed site frequency spectrum (SFS) to an expected SFS given a hypothesized distribution of selection coefficients and demographic history. The development of tools to infer gene trees from haplotype alignments, along with ancient DNA resources, provides us with additional information about the frequency trajectories of segregating mutations. Here, we ask how useful this additional information is for learning about the DFE, using the joint distribution on allele frequency and age to summarize information about the trajectory. To this end, we introduce an accurate and efficient numerical method for computing the density on the age of a segregating variant found at a given sample frequency, given the strength of selection and an arbitrarily complex population size history. We then use this framework to show that the unconditional age distribution of negatively selected alleles is very closely approximated by re-weighting the neutral age distribution in terms of the negatively selected SFS, suggesting that allele ages provide little information about the DFE beyond that already contained in the present day frequency. To confirm this prediction, we extended the standard Poisson Random Field (PRF) method to incorporate the joint distribution of frequency and age in estimating selection coefficients, and test its performance using simulations. We find that when the full SFS is observed and the true allele ages are known, including ages in the estimation provides only small increases in the accuracy of estimated selection coefficients. However, if only sites with frequencies above a certain threshold are observed, then the true ages can provide substantial information about the selection coefficients, especially when the selection coefficient is large. When ages are estimated from haplotype data using state-of-the-art tools, uncertainty about the age abrogates most of the additional information in the fully observed SFS case, while the neutral prior assumed in these tools when estimating ages induces a downward bias in the case of the thresholded SFS.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

We show that proseLM benefits from the scaling trends of underlying language models, and that the addition of non-protein context - nucleic acids, ligands, and ions - improves recovery of native residues during design by 4-5% across model scales. These improvements are most pronounced for residues that directly interface with non-protein context, which are faithfully recovered at rates >70% by the most capable proseLM models.

The process involved a near hierarchical increase in complexity from life forms with few cell types to organisms with many hundreds of cell-types. However, neither genome size nor number of protein-coding genes can explain these differences and their biological basis remains elusive. Yet, recent studies have suggested that the evolution of complexity is closely linked to the acquisition of a class of protein coding gene-regulators called microRNAs.

In a regressive approach, to investigate the association between loss of organismal complexity and microRNAs, we here studied Syndermata, an invertebrate group including free-living rotifers (Monogononta, Bdelloidea), the epibiotic Seisonidea and the endoparasitic Acanthocephala. Genomic, transcriptomic and morphological characterization and comparisons across 25 syndermatan species revealed a strong correlation between loss of microRNAs, loss of protein-coding genes and decreasing morphological complexity. The near hierarchical loss extends to [~]85% loss of microRNAs and a [~]50% loss of BUSCO genes in the endoparasitic Acanthocephala, the most reduced group we studied.

Together, the loss of [~]400 protein-coding genes and [~]10 metazoan core gene losses went along with one microRNA family loss. Furthermore, the loss of [~]4 microRNA families or [~]34 metazoan core genes associated with one lost morphological feature. These are the first quantitative insights into the regulatory impact of microRNAs on organismic complexity as a predictable consequence in regressive evolution of parasites.

However, disruption of domain structure often results in mild gene dysregulation and thus predicting the impact of boundary rearrangements on animal development remains challenging. Here, we tested whether structural perturbation of a chromatin domain with multiple developmental regulators can result in more acute gene dysregulation and severe developmental phenotypes. We targeted clusters of CTCF motifs in a domain of the mouse genome containing three FGF ligand genes--Fgf3, Fgf4, and Fgf15--that regulate several developmental processes. Deletion of the 23.9kb cluster that defines the centromeric boundary of this domain resulted in ectopic interactions of the FGF genes with enhancers located across the deleted boundary that are active in the developing brain. This caused strong induction of FGF expression and perinatal lethality with encephalocele and orofacial cleft phenotypes. Heterozygous boundary deletion was sufficient to cause these fully penetrant phenotypes, and strikingly, loss of a single CTCF motif within the cluster also recapitulated ectopic FGF expression and caused encephalocele. However, such phenotypic sensitivity to perturbation of domain structure did not extend to all CTCF clusters of this domain, nor to all developmental processes controlled by these three FGF genes--for example, the ability to undergo lineage specification in the blastocyst and pre-implantation development were not affected. By tracing the impact of different chromosomal rearrangements throughout mouse development, we start to uncover the determinants of phenotypic robustness and sensitivity to perturbation of chromatin boundaries. Our data show how small sequence variants at certain domain boundaries can have a surprisingly outsized effect and must be considered as potential sources of gene dysregulation during development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

However, the algorithms used to detect changes in pitch, or pitch motion, are incompletely understood. Here, using psychophysics, computational modeling, functional neuroimaging, and analysis of recorded speech, we ask if humans detect pitch motion using computations analogous to those used by the visual system. We adapted stimuli from studies of vision to create novel auditory correlated noise stimuli that elicited robust pitch motion percepts. Crucially, these stimuli possess no persistent features across frequency or time, but do possess positive or negative local spectrotemporal correlations in intensity. In psychophysical experiments, we found clear evidence that humans judge pitch direction based on both positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations. The observed sensitivity to negative correlations is a direct analogue of illusory ""reverse-phi"" motion in vision, and thus constitutes a new auditory illusion. Our behavioral results and computational modeling led us to hypothesize that human auditory processing employs pitch direction opponency. fMRI measurements in auditory cortex supported this hypothesis. To link our psychophysical findings to real-world pitch perception, we analyzed recordings of English and Mandarin speech and discovered that pitch direction was robustly signaled by the same positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations used in our psychophysical tests, suggesting that sensitivity to both positive and negative correlations confers ecological benefits. Overall, this work reveals that motion detection algorithms sensitive to local correlations are deployed by the central nervous system across disparate modalities (vision and audition) and dimensions (space and frequency).","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Epigenetic clocks have been trained almost exclusively using blood-based tissues but there is growing interest in estimating epigenetic age using less-invasive oral-based tissues (i.e., buccal or saliva) in both research and commercial settings. However, differentiated cell types across body tissues exhibit unique DNA methylation landscapes and age-related alterations to the DNA methylome. Applying epigenetic clocks derived from blood-based tissues to estimate epigenetic age of oral-based tissues may introduce biases. We tested the within-person comparability of common epigenetic clocks across five tissue types: buccal epithelial, saliva, dry blood spots, buffy coat (i.e., leukocytes), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We tested 284 distinct tissue samples from 83 individuals aged 9-70 years. Overall, there were significant within-person differences in epigenetic clock estimates from oral-based versus blood-based tissues, with average differences of almost 30 years observed in some age clocks. In addition, most epigenetic clock estimates of blood-based tissues exhibited low correlation with estimates from oral-based tissues despite controlling for cellular proportions and other technical factors. Our findings indicate that application of blood-derived epigenetic clocks in oral-based tissues may not yield comparable estimates of epigenetic age, highlighting the need for careful consideration of tissue type when estimating epigenetic age.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Our analysis identified two distinct evolutionary trajectories: one driven by a single ancestral clone, and another involving multiple independent ancestral clones, potentially influencing the timing and nature of PDAC onset. We further explored the roles of mutational signatures and structural variants (SVs) in promoting clonal evolution. Complementing these genomic findings, our transcriptomic analysis revealed unique gene expression profiles and variations in the immune landscape, correlating with the different progression stages from IPMN to PDAC. These insights reveal the complex molecular dynamics of IPMN progression to PDAC, highlighting the need to refine early detection and treatment strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

To enable complementary functional studies, we developed a scalable approach for recapitulating cell states in vitro using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) Perturb-seq. Aided by a novel multiplexing method, we activated 1,836 transcription factors in two cell types. Measuring 21,958 perturbations showed that CRISPRa activated targets within physiological ranges, that epigenetic features predicted activatable genes, and that the protospacer seed region drove an off-target effect. Perturbations recapitulated in vivo fibroblast states, including universal and inflammatory states, and identified KLF4 and KLF5 as key regulators of the universal state. Inducing the universal state suppressed disease-associated states, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

Here, by examining interchromosomal rearrangements in 64 chromosome-level genomes across 15 bilaterian phyla and at least 52 classes, we show that cases of genome structure conservation are exceptionally rare.

Accumulation of the Arabidopsis NADPH oxidase RBOHD is regulated by phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal residue (T912) leading to ubiquitination by the RING E3 ligase PIRE. Arabidopsis PIRE knockouts exhibit enhanced ROS production and resistance to the foliar pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Here, we identified 170 PIRE homologs, which emerged in Tracheophytes and expanded in Angiosperms. We investigated the role of Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) PIRE homologs in regulating ROS production, RBOH stability, and disease resistance. Mutational analyses of residues corresponding to T912 in the tomato RBOHD ortholog, SlRBOHB, affected protein accumulation and ROS production in a PIRE-dependent manner. Using CRISPR-cas9, we generated mutants in two S. lycopersicum PIRE homologs (SlPIRE). SlPIRE1 edited lines (Slpire1) in the tomato cultivar M82 displayed enhanced ROS production upon treatment with flg22, an immunogenic epitope of flagellin. Furthermore, Slpire1 exhibited decreased disease symptoms and bacterial accumulation when inoculated with foliar bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas campestris. However, Slpire1 exhibited similar levels of colonization as wild type upon inoculation with diverse soilborne pathogens. These results indicate that phosphorylation and ubiquitination crosstalk regulate RBOHs in multiple plant species, and PIRE is a promising target for foliar disease control. This study also highlights the pathogen-specific role of PIRE, indicating its potential for targeted manipulation to enhance foliar disease resistance without affecting root-associated interactions, positioning PIRE as a promising target for improving overall plant health.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

The message is that brain activity is what differentiates subjects, or in other words, what makes a neural fingerprint ""unique"". In EEG- and MEG-derived FC fingerprinting, the activity recorded at the sensors is projected back into cortical sources by means of an inverse model containing the shape of the head and its conductivity, and further averaged to obtain time series of regional activity, used to compute FC.

These difficult-to-diagnose individuals are uniquely disadvantaged and pose significant challenges to healthcare systems and society. Despite having diseases caused by actionable single gene mutations, in many cases, there is no commercial path for treatments for such small patient populations. Since antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology has proven to be suited to address the needs of a portion of these patients, the n-Lorem Foundation is establishing an industrialized approach that couples detailed genotypic and phenotypic data to the immediate potential for ASO therapy. In this manuscript we have leveraged our experience in assessing the causality of nano-rare genetic variants and associated proximal molecular pathological events to attempt a correlation between detailed genetic data with patient specific phenotypic observations in 173 nano-rare individuals from diverse age groups evaluated for experimental ASO therapy. We found that the time required to achieve a molecular diagnosis varies from 1 month to 36 years, with the mean and median times from symptom onset to diagnosis estimated to be 4.32 years and 2 years, respectively. Amongst submitted cases there is a significant bias toward neurological diseases, with diverse genes and functional families involved and a marked preponderance of mutations in ion channel genes. The variability in phenotypic expression associated with nano-rare variants in genes such as GNAO1, H3F3A, GBE1, UBTF, or PACS1 clearly supports previous observations that phenotypes associated with same variants in the same gene can vary. We also observe that different, but functionally equivalent variants can result in both similar (e.g., TARDBP) and different phenotypes (e.g., GNAO1). Despite the relatively small size of the patient population investigated, this first compilation of its kind allows a variety of insights into the genotype and phenotype relationships in nano-rare conditions. Moreover, we show that our unique patient population presents a remarkable opportunity to apply ''modern omics'' approaches to begin to understand the various homeostatic, compensatory, and secondary effects of these genetic variants on the networks that result in expression of their unique phenotypes. To provide a more detailed description of the processes involved to provide a personalized antisense medicine, we have included nonclinical and clincal data on four exemplary patients who display disease in three different organs, the CNS, the eye and the kidney and are treated with ASOs of different designs. In contrast to traditional drug development, each patient presents unique genomic, ASO design, clinical treatment and management and evaluation challenges.","NA","medrxiv",1723068378888

While this framework is well-suited for hypothesis testing approaches, achieving the modern goal of precision medicine requires a different framework that is predictive in nature and that focuses on maximizing the predictive power of models and evaluating their ability to generalize beyond the data that were used to train them. However, few tools exist to support the development and evaluation of predictive models in the context of neuroimaging or lesion-behavior research, creating an obstacle to the widespread adoption of predictive modeling approaches in the field. Further, existing tools for lesion-behavior analysis are often unable to accommodate categorical outcome variables and often impose restrictions on the predictor data. Researchers therefore often must use different software packages and analytical approaches depending on whether they are addressing a classification vs. regression problem and on whether their predictor data correspond to binary lesion images, continuous lesion-network images, connectivity matrices, or other data modalities. To address these limitations, we have developed a MATLAB software toolkit that supports both inferential and predictive modeling frameworks, accommodates both classification and regression problems, and does not impose restrictions on the modality of the predictor data. The toolkit features both a graphical user interface and scripting interface, includes implementations of multiple mass-univariate, multivariate, and machine learning models, features built-in and customizable routines for hyper-parameter optimization, cross-validation, model stacking, and significance testing, and automatically generates text-based descriptions of key methodological details and modeling results to improve reproducibility and minimize errors in the reporting of methods and results. Here, we provide an overview and discussion of the toolkits features and demonstrate its functionality by applying it to the question of how expressive and receptive language impairments relate to lesion location, structural disconnection, and functional network disruption in a large sample of patients with left hemispheric brain lesions. We find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are most strongly associated with left lateral prefrontal and left posterior temporal/parietal damage, respectively. We also find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are associated with partially overlapping patterns of fronto-temporal structural disconnection, and that the associated functional networks are also similar. Importantly, we find that lesion location and lesion-derived network measures are highly predictive of both types of impairment, with predictions from models trained on these measures explaining [~]30-40% of the variance on average when applied to data from patients not used to train the models. We have made the toolkit publicly available, and we have included a comprehensive set of tutorial notebooks to support new users in applying the toolkit in their studies.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

During stress, these hubs are remodeled into translationally repressed mesoscale bodies containing messenger, ribosomal, and double-stranded RNA. We show that the highly conserved helicase SUV3 contributes to the distribution of processed RNA within mitochondrial networks, and that stress bodies form downstream of proteostatic stress in cells lacking SUV3 unwinding activity. We propose that the spatial organization of nascent chain synthesis into discrete domains serves to throttle the flow of genetic information in stress to ensure mitochondrial quality control.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

We developed a rapid eQTL analysis approach using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing of gametes from a small number of heterozygous individuals. Patterns of inherited polymorphisms are used to infer the recombinant genomes of thousands of individual gametes and identify how different haplotypes correlate with variation in gene expression. Applied to Arabidopsis pollen nuclei, our approach uncovers both cis- and trans-eQTLs, ultimately mapping variation in a master regulator of sperm cell development that affects the expression of hundreds of genes.

Although most of the EMCV proteins are obtained via proteolytic cleavage of a long polyprotein, 2B* is expressed from a short overlapping open reading frame via an unusual protein-stimulated temporally dependent ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The function of 2B* has not yet been characterised, though mutant viruses that are unable to express 2B* have a small plaque phenotype. Here we show that 2B* binds all seven members of the 14-3-3 protein family during virus infection. Binding is dependent on the 2B* C-terminal sequence RRNSS. IFN-{beta} and IL-6 signalling are impeded following overexpression of 2B* but not a truncated version lacking the RRNSS residues, thus suggesting a 14-3-3-dependent role for 2B* in inhibiting MAVS signalling. We also find that this function is distinct from the effect of 2B* on plaque size, as a virus in which 2B* was similarly truncated exhibited near-wildtype plaque size, thus indicating that 2B* also harbours additional functions. This work provides the first identification of a role of 2B* in innate immune antagonism and expands our knowledge of the protein complement of this important model virus.

IMPORTANCEEncephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infects a range of species, causing economically important reproductive disorders in pigs and encephalitis and myocarditis in rodents. Due to its wide host range, it is an important model pathogen for investigating virus-host interactions. EMCV expresses an accessory protein, 2B*, from an overlapping open reading frame via an unusual ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Although the frameshifting mechanism has been established, the function of the 2B* protein had not previously been explored. Here, we determined the host proteins to which 2B* binds and found that it specifically binds to the entire 14-3-3 protein family which, among other roles, contribute to the innate immune response to viral infection in mammalian cells. This interaction requires a specific stretch of amino acids at the end of 2B*. By interacting with the 14-3-3 proteins, 2B* blocks immune response activation. Thus, 2B* is a novel antagonist of innate immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Using advanced 3D multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, here we identified antigen-presentation niches in tumor-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance, and affinity evolution of a unique population of TCF-1+PD-1+SLAMF6hi stem-like CD8+ T cells. Our results show that contrary to the prevailing view that persistent TCR signaling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement well beyond the initial priming phase sustained the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway plays a central role in this process by mediating the fine-tuning of TCR and co-stimulatory signal input that enables selective expansion of high affinity TCR stem-like clones, enabling them to act as a renewable source of high affinity effector cells. PD-1 checkpoint blockade disrupts this fine tuning of input signaling, leading to terminal differentiation to the effector state or death of the most avid anti-tumor stem-like cells. Our results thus reveal an unexpected relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative feedback regulatory loop, and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumor effect that comes at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high affinity stem-like precursors.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Human brain imaging has identified dysregulation of a hippocampal-lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) network in binge eating, but mechanistic instantiation of underlying cell-types and circuitry is lacking. Here, we identify an evolutionary conserved and discrete Prodynorphin (Pdyn)-expressing subpopulation of Somatostatin (Sst)-expressing inhibitory neurons in the dorsolateral septum (DLS) that receives primarily dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampal inputs. DLS(Pdyn) neurons inhibit LHA GABAergic neurons and confer context- and internal state-dependent calibration of feeding. Viral deletion of Pdyn in the DLS mimicked effects seen with optogenetic silencing of DLS Pdyn INs, suggesting a potential role for DYNORPHIN-KAPPA OPIOID RECEPTOR signaling in contextual regulation of food-seeking. Together, our findings illustrate how the dorsal hippocampus has evolved to recruit an ancient LHA feeding circuit module through Pdyn DLS inhibitory neurons to link contextual information with regulation of food consumption.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

This is despite the disproportionate potential benefits such models could have to livestock research, from improving breeding values to prioritising functional variants at trait-associated loci. A key open question is what datasets and modelling approaches are most important to close this performance gap between species. In this work we have developed a new framework for predicting regulatory variants, that includes deriving key conservation metrics in cattle for the first time, variant annotation and model training. When trained on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data for human and cattle we show that this framework has a high performance at predicting regulatory variants, with a maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) score of 0.92 in human and 0.81 in cattle. We explore various approaches to further close this performance gap, including integrating advanced DNA sequence models and generating extra chromatin data, but illustrate that the best approach would be generating improved gold-standard sets of known cattle regulatory variants. Importantly we demonstrate both the human and cattle models substantially enrich for variants linked to important traits, with up to 25-fold enrichments for functional variants observed. Consequently, with our framework developed to be applicable across species these results not only demonstrate its potential utility for fine-mapping functional variants and improving breeding values in cattle, but also its potential for wider use across animal species.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

In healthy controls (HC) regulation of CBF is complex and involves multiple mechanisms including cardiac output (CO), cerebral perfusion pressure, PO2 and PCO2, flow-metabolism coupling, and innervation of cerebral vessels. In ME/CFS multiple other mechanisms have also been identified.

Aim of the studyWe previously found that both CBF and CO were reduced in ME/CFS patients during tilt testing, and we hypothesized that the relation between CBF and CO is abnormal and different from HC. In this retrospective study we analyzed this relation in a large group of patients. To compare the patient data with those of HC, we focused on patients with a normal heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) response to upright tilt. Also, the influence of clinical data was analyzed.

MethodsA total of 534 ME/CFS patients and 49 HC underwent tilt testing with measurements of HR, BP, CBF, and CO. In 46 (9%) patients CO and CBF changes were in the normal range of HC, and in 488 (91%) an abnormal CO and CBF reduction was found.

Resultspatients with a CO and CBF reduction in the range of HC had less severe disease and were more likely to be male. In patients with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction the slope of the regression line of CO versus CBF reduction was almost 1. A multiple regression analysis of the latter group, including patients with PetCO2 measurements (440/488: 90%) showed that the CO reduction for the major part predicted the CBF reduction, with a limited role for the PetCO2 reduction and the tilt duration. Other data did not add to the model.

ConclusionsTwo different patient groups with a normal HR and BP response during the tilt were identified: those with a CO and CBF in the normal range of HC and those with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction during the tilt (91% of patients). The former group had milder disease and included more men. In the largest group of patients there was an almost 1:1 relation between the CO and CBF reduction, suggesting absence of compensatory vasodilation in the cerebral vasculature. This may be an appropriate target for clinical and therapeutic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1723068378888

We report cell size reduction via macropinocytosis as an alternative mechanism. Macropinocytosis is triggered by tissue crowding via mechanosensory signaling, leading to substantial internalization of apical membrane and driving a reduction in apical cell size that remodels the epithelium to alleviate crowding. We report that this mechanism regulates the long-term organization of developing epithelium in response to proliferation-induced crowding but also serves as an immediate response to acute external compression. In both cases, inhibiting macropinocytosis induces a dramatic increase in cell extrusion suggesting cooperation between cell extrusion and macropinocytosis in response to compression. Our findings implicate macropinocytosis as an important regulator of dynamic epithelial remodeling.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Here, using controlled laboratory experiments and environmental metatranscriptomic analysis, we investigate the impact of nutrient enrichment on bacterial EPS production, while bacteria are in the context of their algal hosts. Our findings demonstrate a marked increase in bacterial EPS production in response to an increase of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen levels, both in the lab and in the environment.

When we imaged apoF with a laser phase plate (LPP), however, we observed more severe particle-to-particle variation in the images than we had previously thought to exist. Similarly, we found that images of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) also exhibited a much greater amount of heterogeneity than expected. By comparison to simulations of images, we verified that the heterogeneity is not explained by the known features of the LPP, shot noise, or differences in particle orientation. We also demonstrate that our specimens are comparable to those previously used in the literature, based on using the final-reconstruction resolution as the metric for evaluation. All of this leads us to the hypothesis that the heterogeneity is due to damage that has occurred either during purification of the specimen or during preparation of the grids. It is not, however, our goal to explain the causes of heterogeneity; rather, we report that using the LPP has made the apparent damage too obvious to be ignored. In hindsight, similar heterogeneity can be seen in images of apoF and the 20S proteasome which others had recorded with a Volta phase plate. We therefore conclude that the increased contrast of phase-plate images (at low spatial frequencies) should also make it possible to visualize, on a single-particle basis, various forms of biologically functional heterogeneity in structure that had previously gone unnoticed.

The nuclear lamina is involved in chromatin organisation through the interaction of lamina-associated domains (LADs) within the densely packed heterochromatin regions. Employing cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling in conjunction with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we analysed the distribution of nucleosomes at the lamin-chromatin interface. Depletion of lamin A/C reduced the concentration of nucleosomes at the nuclear periphery, suggesting that lamins are directly involved in the interaction with chromatin. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we then identified the specific binding motif of the lamin A tail domain that interacts with nucleosomes, distinguishing it from the other lamin isoforms. Furthermore, we examined chromatin structure dynamics using a genome-wide analysis that revealed lamin-dependent macroscopic-scale alterations in gene expression and chromatin remodelling. Our findings provide detailed insights into the dynamic and structural interplay between lamin isoforms and chromatin, molecular interactions which are shaping chromatin architecture and epigenetic regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the reemergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024.

MethodsIn this study, we combined OROV genomic, molecular, and serological data from Brazil from 1 January 2015 to 29 June 2024, along with in vitro and in vivo characterization. Molecular screening data included 93 patients with febrile illness between January 2023 and February 2024 from the Amazonas State. Genomic data comprised two genomic OROV sequences from patients. Serological data were obtained from neutralizing antibody tests comparing the prototype OROV strain BeAn 19991 and the 2024 epidemic strain. Epidemiological data included aggregated cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 1 January 2014 to 29 June 2024.

FindingsIn 2024, autochthonous OROV infections were detected in previously non-endemic areas across all five Brazilian regions. Cases were reported in 19 of 27 federal units, with 83.2% (6,895 of 8,284) of infections in Northern Brazil and a nearly 200-fold increase in incidence compared to reported cases over the last decade. We detected OROV RNA in 10.8% (10 of 93) of patients with febrile illness between December 2023 and May 2024 in Amazonas. We demonstrate that the 2023-2024 epidemic was caused by a novel OROV reassortant that replicated approximately 100-fold higher titers in mammalian cells compared to the prototype strain. The 2023-2024 OROV reassortant displayed plaques earlier than the prototype, produced 1.7 times more plaques, and plaque sizes were 2.5 larger compared to the prototype. Furthermore, serum collected in 2016 from previously OROV-infected individuals showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralizing capacity against the reassortment strain compared to the prototype.

InterpretationThese findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to a better understanding of the 2023-2024 OROV reemergence. The recent increased incidence may be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new reassortant virus that also evades previous immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1723068378888

Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), the first viral protein produced during coronaviral infections, inhibits host protein synthesis and induces mRNA degradation to enhance viral proliferation. However, the interconnection between the two processes and whether host mRNA degradation depends on the active translation of targeted mRNAs remains enigmatic. Here, intrigued by the observation that Nsp1 does not stimulate ribosome collisions, we use a human cell-free translation system to decouple the main Nsp1 activities, showing that Nsp1 can induce mRNA degradation independently of translation inhibition. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binding to the ribosome is sufficient to trigger host mRNA degradation without requiring ribosome scanning or translation elongation, stimulating degradation at the 5'end of the transcript. Interestingly, for MERS-CoV, Nsp1 causes translation inhibition without triggering mRNA degradation. Using Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, MERS and Bat-Hp coronaviruses, we observe 5UTR-specific protection of viral mRNAs, indicating a co-evolutionary adaptation mechanism of the two viral features. Our findings mirror key observations from living cells about Nsp1-mediated mRNA degradation, highlighting the utility of cell-free systems in monitoring and decoupling translation-related processes and providing new insights into this interplay.

While it has been observed that some cell types are far more evolutionarily conserved than others, the factors driving these differences in evolutionary rate remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that highly abundant neuronal cell types may be under greater selective constraint than rarer neuronal types, leading to variation in their rates of evolution. To test this, we leveraged recently published cross-species single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from three distinct regions of the mammalian neocortex. We found a strikingly consistent relationship where more abundant neuronal subtypes show greater gene expression conservation between species, which replicated across three independent datasets covering >106 neurons from six species. Based on this principle, we discovered that the most abundant type of neocortical neurons--layer 2/3 intratelencephalic excitatory neurons--has evolved exceptionally quickly in the human lineage compared to other apes. Surprisingly, this accelerated evolution was accompanied by the dramatic down-regulation of autism-associated genes, which was likely driven by polygenic positive selection specific to the human lineage. In sum, we introduce a general principle governing neuronal evolution and suggest that the exceptionally high prevalence of autism in humans may be a direct result of natural selection for lower expression of a suite of genes that conferred a fitness benefit to our ancestors while also rendering an abundant class of neurons more sensitive to perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

The popular harmonization approach ComBat uses a mixed effect regression framework that explicitly accounts for covariate distribution differences across datasets. There is also significant interest in developing harmonization approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs), such as conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE). However, current DNN approaches do not explicitly account for covariate distribution differences across datasets. Here, we provide mathematical results, suggesting that not accounting for covariates can lead to suboptimal harmonization. We propose two DNN-based covariate-aware harmonization approaches: covariate VAE (coVAE) and DeepResBat. The coVAE approach is a natural extension of cVAE by concatenating covariates and site information with site- and covariate-invariant latent representations. DeepResBat adopts a residual framework inspired by ComBat. DeepResBat first removes the effects of covariates with nonlinear regression trees, followed by eliminating site differences with cVAE. Finally, covariate effects are added back to the harmonized residuals. Using three datasets from three continents with a total of 2787 participants and 10085 anatomical T1 scans, we find that DeepResBat and coVAE outperformed ComBat, CovBat and cVAE in terms of removing dataset differences, while enhancing biological effects of interest. However, coVAE hallucinates spurious associations between anatomical MRI and covariates even when no association exists. Future studies proposing DNN-based harmonization approaches should be aware of this false positive pitfall. Overall, our results suggest that DeepResBat is an effective deep learning alternative to ComBat.

However, since late 2022, OROV has been reported in northern Brazil as well as urban centers in Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, and Peru. Herein, we describe the doubling of publicly available full genomes by generating 133 new entries. We show how the virus evolved via genome component reassortment and how it rapidly spread across multiple states in Brazil, causing the largest outbreak ever recorded outside the Amazon basin including the first ever detected deaths. This work highlights the need for heightened epidemiological and genomic surveillance and the implementation of adequate measures in order to mitigate transmission and the impacts on the population. Background: Oropouche virus was first identified in 1955 in Trinidad and Tobago and later found in Brazil in 1960. Historically, it has been reported to have caused around 30 outbreaks, mostly within the Amazon Basin, where it circulates among forest animals, but also in urban areas where it is known to be transmitted by the midge Culicoides paraensis. Recently, Brazil has seen a surge in cases, with more than 7000 reported by mid-2024 alone. Methods: In a collaboration with Central Public Health Laboratories across Brazilian regions, we integrated epidemiological metadata with genomic analyses of recently sampled cases. This initiative resulted in the generation of 133 whole genome sequences from the three genomic segments (L, M, and S) of the virus, including the first genomes obtained from regions outside the Amazon and from the first ever recorded fatal cases. Findings: All of the 2024 genomes form a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic tree with sequences from the Amazon Basin sampled since 2022. Our analyses revealed a rapid north-to-south viral movement from the Amazon Basin into historically non-endemic regions. We identified 21 reassortment events, although it remains unclear if genomic evolution of the virus enabled the virus to adapt to local ecological conditions and evolve new phenotypes of public health importance. Interpretation: Both the recent rapid spatial expansion and the first reported fatalities associated with Oropouche (and other outcomes under investigation) underscore the importance of enhancing surveillance for this evolving pathogen across the Region. Without any obvious changes in the human population over the past 2 years, it is possible that viral adaptation, deforestation and recent climate change, either alone or in combination, have propelled Oropouche virus beyond the Amazon Basin.","NA","medrxiv",1723068378888

However, identifying biological signals in this data is challenging due to confounding technical factors, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Data factorization methods address this by separating and identifying signals in the data, such as gene expression programs, but the resulting factors must be manually interpreted. We developed Single-Cell Interpretable Residual Decomposition (sciRED) to improve the interpretation of scRNA-seq factor analysis. sciRED removes known confounding effects, uses rotations to improve factor interpretability, maps factors to known covariates, identifies unexplained factors that may capture hidden biological phenomena and determines the genes and biological processes represented by the resulting factors. We apply sciRED to multiple scRNA-seq datasets and identify sex-specific variation in a kidney map, discern strong and weak immune stimulation signals in a PBMC dataset, reduce ambient RNA contamination in a rat liver atlas to help identify strain variation, and reveal rare cell type signatures and anatomical zonation gene programs in a healthy human liver map. These demonstrate that sciRED is useful in characterizing diverse biological signals within scRNA-seq data.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Studies using normative modelling to infer person specific deviations of grey matter volume have indicated that group means are not representative of most individuals. The extent to which this variability is present in white matter morphometry, which is integral to brain function, remains unclear. Methods: We applied Warped Bayesian Linear Regression normative models to T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging data and mapped interindividual variability in person specific white matter volume deviations in 1,294 cases (58% male) diagnosed with one of six disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity, autism, bipolar, major depressive, obsessive compulsive and schizophrenia) and 1,465 matched controls (54% male) recruited across 25 scan sites. We developed a framework to characterize deviation heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, from individual voxels, through inter-regional connections, specific brain regions, and spatially extended brain networks. Results: The specific locations of white matter volume deviations were highly heterogeneous across participants, affecting the same voxel in fewer than 8% of individuals with the same diagnosis. For autism and schizophrenia, negative deviations (i.e., areas where volume is lower than normative expectations) aggregated into common tracts, regions and large scale networks in up to 35% of individuals. Conclusions: The prevalence of white matter volume deviations was lower than previously observed in grey matter, and the specific location of these deviations was highly heterogeneous when considering voxelwise spatial resolution. Evidence of aggregation within common pathways and networks was apparent in schizophrenia and autism but not other disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

However, the complexity of the data and the need for advanced computational skills limit their accessibility. To address this, we introduce C-COMPASS, an open-source software featuring a user-friendly interface that utilizes a neural network-based regression model to predict the spatial distribution of proteins across cellular compartments. C-COMPASS manages complex multilocalization patterns and integrates protein abundance information to model organelle composition changes under various biological conditions. Using C-COMPASS, we mapped the organelle proteomic landscapes of humanized liver mice in different metabolic states and modeled changes in organelle composition to provide insights into cellular adaptations. Additionally, we extended cellular maps to the lipid level by co-generating protein and lipid profiles. C-COMPASS trains neural networks with marker protein profiles to predict lipid localizations, enabling parallel mapping of lipid and protein localization. This approach overcomes the lack of knowledge of organelle-specific lipid markers and identifies previously unknown organelle-specific lipid species. C-COMPASS offers a comprehensive solution for studying organelle dynamics at the multi-omics level, designed to be accessible without requiring extensive computational expertise or specialized high-performance computing equipment.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

However, the sequence of events leading to these impairments and the distinction between primary and compensatory processes remain unclear. We addressed this question by reversibly blocking cerebellar outflow in monkeys performing planar center-out movements. We found that a reduced hand velocity observed when blocking cerebellar outflow during reaching movements is due to a decrease in muscle torque and a spatially tuned reduction in velocity, particularly pronounced during movements involving inter-joint interactions. The time course of these two processes was examined using the sequence of trials of movements to the same target when blocking cerebellar outflow. We found that during multi-joint reaching movements, the reduced velocity was driven by an acute deficit superimposed on a gradually emergent strategic slowing aimed to minimize passive inter-joint interactions. Finally, the reduction in velocity could not explain the increased motor noise observed during a cerebellar block, which manifested as decomposed and variable trajectories. Our results suggest that loss of cerebellar signals leads to motor impairments through insufficient muscle torques and altered motor control strategy to compensate for the impaired control of limb dynamics. However, impaired feedforward control also increases motor noise, which cannot be strategically eliminated.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Parallel RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS of microdissections identified over 15,000 mRNA transcripts and 10,000 proteins, revealing thousands with local enrichment such as classes of glutamate receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels, myelin-associated molecules, and adhesion molecules. Synaptosome analysis further identified specific enrichment of molecules from collagen, ribosome, solute carrier, and receptor families at different synapses formed along CA1 neurons. By integrating mRNA and protein data, we defined clusters of co-regulated molecules such as adhesion and neurofilament proteins and transporter mRNAs, and found subsets of mRNA-protein pairs with strong correlation and anti-correlation in their abundance variation.

Estrous cycle stage had a potent effect on spine dynamics, with heightened density during periods of greater estradiol (proestrus). These morphological changes were accompanied by greater somatodendritic coupling and increased infiltration of back-propagating action potentials into the apical dendrite.

A commonly adopted approach to reconstruct complex demographic dynamics is the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. It exploits coalescent simulations to generate the expected level of variation under different evolutionary scenarios. Demographic inference is then performed by comparing the simulated data with the genotypes called in the sampled individuals. Low sequencing coverage drastically affects the ability to reliably call genotypes, thus making low-coverage data unsuitable for such powerful inferential approaches.

Here, we present Low-ABC, a new ABC approach to infer past population processes using low-coverage whole-genome data. Under this framework, both observed and simulated genetic variation are not directly compared using called genotypes, but rather obtained using genotype likelihoods to consider the uncertainty caused by the low sequencing coverage. We first evaluated the inferential power of this procedure in distinguishing among different demographic models and in inferring model parameters under different experimental conditions, including a wide spectrum of sequencing coverage (1x to 30x), number of individuals, number, and size of genetic loci.

We showed that the use of genotype likelihoods integrated into an ABC framework provides a reliable inference of past population dynamics, thus making possible the application of model-based inference also for low-coverage data. We then applied Low-ABC to shed light on the relationship between Mesolithic and Early Neolithic European populations.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

We estimate a recent divergence from the closest tick-borne ancestor, likely within the last [~]8,000 years. We reconstruct a chronology of gene losses and acquisitions using the pan-genome of related species, and show that almost all of the reductive evolution observed in B. recurrentis had occurred by [~]2,000 years ago, and was thus a rapid process after divergence. Our observations provide a new understanding of the origins of B. recurrentis and document complex reductive evolution in a specialist vector-borne pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Quantitation is often done using a colorimetric assay such as the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay in which a change in the color of the BCA reagent is related to protein concentration. Extracted protein samples are compared to a standard curve made with dilutions of a protein standard such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) to determine their concentrations. A series of experiments was designed to determine the most reproducible and accurate method for quantifying protein concentrations of samples in an experimental series over time. The effect of freezing on diluted standards was investigated. Standards were frozen at -20{degrees}C or -80{degrees}C and serially thawed and refrozen up to three times prior to their use in a BCA assay. Thawing and refreezing the standards had no significant effect on protein concentration and the resulting standard curves. Inter-person and intra-person variability in the preparation of standards was also investigated. Protein concentration differences due to inter-person and intra-person variability were greater than protein concentration variability resulting from freezing and thawing, regardless of the freezing temperature. The most reproducible and accurate method for determining the protein concentration of extracted samples in an experimental series over time is diluting a large batch of BSA standards and freezing them at either -20{degrees}C or -80{degrees}C.

Hearing loss is one such early indicator linked to many comorbidities later in life. However, current clinical tests fail to capture hearing difficulties for [~]10% of middle-aged adults seeking help at hearing clinics. Cochlear neural degeneration (CND) could play a role in these hearing deficits, but our current understanding is limited by the lack of objective diagnostics and uncertainty regarding its perceptual consequences. Here, using a cross-species approach, we measured envelope following responses (EFRs) - neural ensemble responses to sound originating from the peripheral auditory pathway - in young and middle-aged adults with normal audiometric thresholds, and compared these responses to young and middle-aged Mongolian gerbils, where CND was histologically confirmed. We observed near identical changes in EFRs across species that were associated with CND. Perceptual effects measured as behavioral readouts showed deficits in the most challenging listening conditions and were associated with CND. Additionally, pupil-indexed listening effort increased even at moderate task difficulties where behavioral outcomes were matched. Our results reveal perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults driven by CND and increases in listening effort, which may result in increased listening fatigue and conversational disengagement.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons. This work has interesting technical applications, and provides a biologically-inspired model of cortical memory.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378888

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378889

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378889

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378889

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1723068378889

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378889

Here, we estimate biological age of 11 organs from 44,526 individuals in the UK Biobank using an antibody-based proteomics platform to model disease and mortality risk. Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimers disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements. Remarkably, the accrual of aged organs progressively increases mortality risk while a youthful brain and immune system are uniquely associated with disease-free longevity. These findings support the use of plasma proteins for monitoring organ health and the efficacy of drugs targeting organ aging disease.","NA","biorxiv",1723068378889
