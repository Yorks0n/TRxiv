We meticulously describe the cardiovascular outcomes in five patients, encompassing a range of severe conditions such as sudden cardiac death during exercise, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, acute inferior myocardial infarction, and acute myocarditis. All five patients were diagnosed with myocarditis, confirmed through endomyocardial biopsy and histochemical staining, which identified inflammatory cell infiltration in their heart tissue. Crucially, electron microscopy revealed widespread mitochondrial vacuolations and the presence of myofilament degradation within the cardiomyocytes of these patients. These findings were mirrored in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, suggesting a potential underlying cellular mechanism for the cardiac effects associated with Long COVID. Our report sheds light on the cardiovascular implications of Long COVID and underscores the importance of further research to understand its cellular underpinnings.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572044

However, tools for comprehensive, high-resolution analysis of disease-associated changes at the whole-body scale have been lacking. Here, we developed a suite of deep learning-based image analysis algorithms (MouseMapper) and integrated it with tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy to enable a comprehensive analysis of diseases impacting diverse systems across the mouse body. This approach enables the quantitative analysis of cellular and structural changes across the entire mouse body at unprecedented resolution and scale, including tracking nerves over several centimeters in whole animal bodies. To demonstrate its power, we applied MouseMapper to study nervous and immune systems in high-fat diet induced obesity. We uncovered widespread changes in both immune cell distribution and nerve structures, including alterations in the trigeminal nerve characterized by a reduced number of nerve endings in obese mice. These structural abnormalities were associated with functional deficits of whisker sensing and proteomic changes in the trigeminal ganglion, primarily affecting pathways related to axon growth and the complement system. Additionally, we found heterogeneity in obesity-induced whole-body inflammation across different tissues and organs. Our study demonstrates MouseMappers capability to discover and quantify pathological alterations at the whole-body level, offering a powerful approach for investigating the systemic impacts of various diseases.

Various in vitro (display) and in vivo (animal immunization and B cell-sequencing) workflows have led to the discovery of antibodies against diverse antigens. Despite this success, standard display and B-cell sequencing-based technologies are limited to targets that can be produced in a soluble form. This limitation inhibits the screening of function-inducing antibodies, which require the target to be expressed in cells to monitor function or signaling, and antibodies targeting proteins that maintain their physiological structure only when expressed on cell membranes, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). A high-throughput two-cell screening workflow, which localizes an antibody-secreting cell (ASC) and a cell expressing the target protein in a microenvironment, can overcome these challenges. To make function-first plasma cell-based antibody discovery accessible and scalable, we developed hydrogel Nanovials that can capture single plasma cells, target-expressing cells, and plasma cell secretions (antibodies). The detection and isolation of Nanovials harboring the antigen-specific plasma cells are then carried out using a flow cytometry cell sorter - an instrument that is available in most academic centers and biopharmaceutical companies. The antibody discovery workflow employing Nanovials was first validated in the context of two different cell membrane-associated antigens produced in recombinant form. We analyzed over 40,000 plasma cells over two campaigns and were able to identify a diversity of binders that i) exhibited high affinity (picomolar) binding, ii) targeted multiple non-overlapping epitopes and iii) demonstrated high developability scores. A campaign using the two-cell assay targeting the immune checkpoint membrane protein PD-1 yielded cell binders with similar EC50s to clinically used Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab. The highest selectivity for binders was observed for sorted events corresponding with the highest signal bound to target cells on Nanovials. Overall, Nanovials can provide a strong foundation for function-first antibody discovery, yielding direct cell binding information and quantitative data on prioritization of hits with flexibility for additional functional readouts in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572044

However, text communication fails to capture the nuances of human speech such as prosody, intonation and immediately hearing ones own voice. Here, we demonstrate a ""brain-to-voice"" neuroprosthesis that instantaneously synthesizes voice with closed-loop audio feedback by decoding neural activity from 256 microelectrodes implanted into the ventral precentral gyrus of a man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe dysarthria. We overcame the challenge of lacking ground-truth speech for training the neural decoder and were able to accurately synthesize his voice. Along with phonemic content, we were also able to decode paralinguistic features from intracortical activity, enabling the participant to modulate his BCI-synthesized voice in real-time to change intonation, emphasize words, and sing short melodies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of enabling people with paralysis to speak intelligibly and expressively through a BCI.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572044

Previous explanations of this phenomenon have posited negative interactions between donor-population alleles and the recipient population's genome or environment, or higher genetic load in the donor population. Here, we show that stabilizing selection on quantitative traits--even around the same optimal trait values in the two populations and when the populations are demographically identical--generates selection against the minor-parent ancestry in a population formed via unequal admixture of the two populations. We calculate the rate at which minor-parent ancestry is purged under this mechanism, both in the early generations after admixture and in the long term, and we verify these calculations with whole-genome simulations. Because of its ubiquity, stabilizing selection offers a general mechanism for the deleterious effect of introgressed ancestry.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572044

Here, we use the UK Biobank to measure the change in PGS prediction accuracy as a continuous function of individuals' genome-wide genetic dissimilarity to the GWAS sample (''genetic distance''). Our results highlight three gaps in our understanding of PGS portability. First, prediction accuracy is extremely noisy at the individual level and not well predicted by genetic distance. In fact, variance in prediction accuracy is explained comparably well by socioeconomic measures. Second, trends of portability vary across traits. For several immunity-related traits, prediction accuracy drops near zero quickly even at intermediate levels of genetic distance. This quick drop may reflect GWAS associations being more ancestry-specific in immunity-related traits than in other traits. Third, we show that even qualitative trends of portability can depend on the measure of prediction accuracy used. For instance, for white blood cell count, a measure of prediction accuracy at the individual level (reduction in mean squared error) increases with genetic distance. Together, our results show that portability cannot be understood through global ancestry groupings alone. There are other, understudied factors influencing portability, such as the specifics of the evolution of the trait and its genetic architecture, social context, and the construction of the polygenic score. Addressing these gaps can aid in the development and application of PGS and inform more equitable genomic research.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572044

Employing this framework, we mapped the 4D distribution of over a hundred lipids at quasi-single-cell resolution in Danio rerio embryos. We discovered metabolic trajectories that unfold in concert with morphogenesis and revealed spatially organized biochemical coordination overlooked by bulk measurements. Interestingly, lipid mapping revealed unexpected distributions of sphingolipid and triglyceride species, suggesting their involvement in pattern establishment and organ development.

Anti-defense proteins have diverse functional domains, sequences, and are typically small, creating a challenge to detect anti-defense homologs across the prokaryotic genomes. To date, no tools comprehensively annotate anti-defense proteins within a desired genome or MGE. Here, we developed ""AntiDefenseFinder"" - a free open-source tool and web service that detects 156 anti-defense systems (of one or more proteins) in any genomic sequence. Using this dataset, we identified 47,981 anti-defense systems distributed across prokaryotes, phage, and MGEs. We found that some genes co-localize in ""anti-defense islands"", including E. coli T4 and Lambda phages, although many are standalone. Out of the 112 systems detected in bacteria, 100 systems localize only or preferentially in prophages, plasmids, phage satellites, integrons, and integrative and conjugative elements. However, over 80% of anti-Pycsar protein 1 (Apyc1) resides in non-mobile regions of bacteria. Evolutionary and functional analyses revealed that Apyc1 likely originated in bacteria to regulate cNMP signaling, but was co-opted multiple times by phages to overcome cNMP-utilizing defenses. With the AntiDefenseFinder tool, we hope to facilitate the identification of the full repertoire of anti-defense systems in MGEs, the discovery of new protein functions, and a deeper understanding of host-pathogen arms race.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572044

Thus far, only a limited number of Clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized, and they are not representative across different regions and time periods.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17/26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 423/603 (70.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to Clade I, among which 17 were Clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (95%) of the new strains fall within previously described Clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among Clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows multiple virus lineages being present within a large urban center.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic in DRC is predominated by zoonotic spillover events involving Clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the Clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572044

This technology allows researchers to sequence longer DNA fragments in a single read, providing more comprehensive genomic information compared to previous methods. Nanopore sequencing operates on electrical signals generated by a nanopore embedded in a membrane separating two electrolyte-filled chambers. When single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) passes through the nanopore, it creates variations in the current that correspond to different DNA bases. By analyzing these current fluctuations with machine learning algorithms, the DNA sequence can be determined.

In this study, two surveys from a large general population cohort, the COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative, undertaken 147 {+/-} 58 days apart were analyzed to determine whether the pre-existing OSA was a risk factor for the incidence of COVID-19. Of the 24,803 respondents completing the initial survey, 14,950 were negative for COVID-19; data from the follow-up survey were available for 2,325 respondents. Those with incident COVID-19 infection had a slightly higher prevalence of OSA (14.3 vs. 11.5%, p=0.068). Stratification by treatment status revealed that those untreated for their OSA were at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection (OSA Untreated, 14.2 vs. 7.4%, p[&le;]0.05). In a logistic regression model adjusted for comorbidities, demographic and socioeconomic factors and the interaction between vaccination status and OSA, incident COVID-19 infection was 2.15 times more likely in those with untreated OSA (aOR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.18-3.92, p[&le;]0.05). Stratification by treatment status revealed only untreated OSA participants were at greater risk for COVID-19 (aOR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.25-8.23, p[&le;]0.05). The evidence from this study confirms untreated OSA as a risk factor for acquiring COVID-19 infection and highlights the importance of actively treating and managing OSA as a preventative mechanism against COVID-19 disease.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572044

Insightful past work has provided a glimpse of decision deliberation at the moment of movement onset. Yet it is unknown whether ongoing deliberation can be expressed during movement, following movement onset and prior to any decision. Here we tested the idea that an ongoing deliberation continually influences motor processes--prior to a decision--directing online movements. Over three experiments, we manipulated evidence to influence deliberation during movement. The deliberation process was manipulated by having participants observe evidence in the form of tokens that moved into a left or right target. Supporting our hypothesis we found that lateral hand movements reflected deliberation, prior to a decision. We also found that a deliberation urgency signal, which more heavily weighs later evidence, was fundamental to predicting decisions and explains past movement behaviour in a new light. Our paradigm promotes the expression of ongoing deliberation through movement, providing a powerful new window into understanding the interplay between decision and action.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572044

However, the specific epigenetic regulators and the processes they control to drive cancer phenotypes are poorly understood. Here, we employed a novel, scalable and high-throughput in vivo method to perform iterative functional screens of over 250 epigenetic regulatory genes within autochthonous oncogenic KRAS-driven lung tumors. We identified multiple novel epigenetic tumor suppressor and tumor dependency genes. We show that a specific HBO1 complex and the MLL1 complex are among the most impactful tumor suppressive epigenetic regulators in lung. The histone modifications generated by the HBO1 complex are frequently absent or reduced in human lung adenocarcinomas. The HBO1 and MLL1 complexes regulate chromatin accessibility of shared genomic regions, lineage fidelity and the expression of canonical tumor suppressor genes. The HBO1 and MLL1 complexes are epistatic during lung tumorigenesis, and their functional correlation is conserved in human cancer cell lines. Together, these results demonstrate the value of quantitative methods to generate a phenotypic roadmap of epigenetic regulatory genes in tumorigenesis in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Widely used higher field (>1.5 T) MRI systems are associated with high energy and infrastructure requirements, and high costs. Recent ultra-low-field (<0.1T) systems provide a more accessible and cost-effective alternative. However, it is not known whether anatomical ultra-low-field neuroimaging can be used to extract quantitative measures of brain morphometry, and to what extent such measures correspond to high-field MRI. Here we scanned 23 healthy adults aged 20-69 years on two identical 64 mT systems and a 3 T system, using T1w and T2w scans across a range of (64 mT) resolutions. We segmented brain images into 4 global tissue types and 98 local structures, and systematically evaluated between-scanner reliability of 64 mT morphometry and correspondence to 3 T measurements, using correlations of tissue volume and Dice spatial overlap of segmentations. We report high 64 mT reliability and correspondence to 3 T across 64 mT scan contrasts and resolutions, with highest performance shown by combining three T2w scans with low through-plane resolution into a single higher-resolution scan using multi-resolution registration. Larger structures show higher 64 mT reliability and correspondence to 3 T. Finally, we showcase the potential of ultra-low-field MRI for mapping neuroanatomical changes across the lifespan, and monitoring brain structures relevant to neurological disorders. Raw images and code are publicly available (upon publication), enabling systematic validation of pre-processing and analysis approaches for ultra-low-field neuroimaging.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a spatial-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

To quantify phenotypic adaptation in BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma, we develop a theoretical model that emerges from data analysis of WM239A-BRAFV600E growth rates in response to drug challenge with the BRAF-inhibitor encorafenib. Our model constitutes a cell population model in which each cell is individually described by one of multiple discrete and plastic phenotype states that are directly linked to drug-dependent net growth rates and, by extension, drug resistance. Data-matched simulations reveal that phenotypic adaptation in the cells is directed towards states of high net growth rates, which enables evasion of drug-effects. The model subsequently provides an explanation for when and why intermittent treatments outperform continuous treatments in vitro, and demonstrates the benefits of not only targeting, but also leveraging, phenotypic adaptation in treatment protocols.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Circulating hematopoietic cells influence risk for CAD, but the role of a key regulating organ, spleen, is unknown. The understudied spleen is a 3-dimensional structure of the hematopoietic system optimally suited for unbiased radiologic investigations toward novel mechanistic insights.

MethodsDeep learning-based image segmentation and radiomics techniques were utilized to extract splenic radiomic features from abdominal MRIs of 42,059 UK Biobank participants. Regression analysis was used to identify splenic radiomics features associated with CAD. Genome-wide association analyses were applied to identify loci associated with these radiomics features. Overlap between loci associated with CAD and the splenic radiomics features was explored to understand the underlying genetic mechanisms of the role of the spleen in CAD.

ResultsWe extracted 107 splenic radiomics features from abdominal MRIs, and of these, 10 features were associated with CAD. Genome-wide association analysis of CAD-associated features identified 219 loci, including 35 previously reported CAD loci, 7 of which were not associated with conventional CAD risk factors. Notably, variants at 9p2 were associated with splenic features such as run length non-uniformity.

ConclusionsOur study, combining deep learning with genomics, presents a new framework to uncover the splenic axis of CAD. Notably, our study provides evidence for the underlying genetic connection between the spleen as a candidate causal tissue-type and CAD with insight into the mechanisms of 9p21, whose mechanism is still elusive despite its initial discovery in 2007. More broadly, our study provides a unique application of deep learning radiomics to non-invasively find associations between imaging, genetics, and clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572045

To this end, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one the most used microbial host for recombinant protein production due to its rapid growth, well-characterised genetics, and ability to produce recombinant proteins in high yields using modern recombinant DNA technology. However, while there is a plethora of robust protein expression protocols for E. coli, these methods are often unsuitable for high-throughput screening due to their significant resource and time consumption; these protocols are also susceptible to operator error and inconsistency.

To address these challenges, we have developed APEX, a robust and automated protocol for recombinant protein production in E. coli. APEX leverages the accessible, open-source Opentrons OT-2 platform to automate microbial handling and protein expression with high precision and repro-ducibility. APEX can be configured to perform heat shock transformation, colony selection, colony sampling, inoculation, subculturing and protein expression using a low-cost, minimal OT-2 hardware setup. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our automated transformation workflows using a variety of plasmids (2.7-17.7 kb), and exemplify the automated heterologous expression of a diverse array of proteins (27-222 kDa). Designed with customization, modularity and user-friendliness in mind, APEX can be easily adapted to the operators needs without requiring any coding expertise.

Auxin-dependent transcriptional changes are mediated by DNA-binding Auxin Response Factors (ARF), whose AuxRE DNA binding sites are well-known. The identification of the first AuxRE showed this to be part of a composite element with a second motif. Indeed, systematic analysis showed other DNA motifs to be enriched in auxin-regulated promoters. Neither the basis for this enrichment nor the mechanisms for the activity of composite AuxREs is known. Here, we systematically mined Arabidopsis promoters for composite AuxRE elements enriched in auxin-responsive genes. We identified many and show that their presence is a reliable predictor of auxin response. Through mutating these elements and their higher-order modules, we demonstrate function in promoter activity. Lastly, we identified transcription factors (TFs) that bind AuxRE-associated motifs, showed their involvement in auxin response, and discovered that several of these TFs directly bind ARF proteins. We propose that ARF-TF complexes specifically bind compound motifs in promoters, and act as a source of diversification in auxin-dependent gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Thus, current research confounds memory per-se with its report. Critically, the ability to investigate memory retrieval in populations with deficient verbal ability is limited. Here, using the MEGA (Memory Episode Gaze Anticipation) paradigm, we show that monitoring anticipatory gaze using eye tracking can quantify memory retrieval without verbal report. Upon repeated viewing of movie clips, eye gaze patterns anticipating salient events can quantify their memory traces seconds before these events appear on the screen. A series of experiments with a total of 126 participants using either tailor-made animations or naturalistic movies consistently reveal that accumulated gaze proximity to the event can index memory. Machine learning-based classification can identify whether a given viewing is associated with memory for the event based on single-trial data of gaze features. Detailed comparison to verbal reports establishes that anticipatory gaze marks recollection of associative memory about the event, whereas pupil dilation captures familiarity. Finally, anticipatory gaze reveals beneficial effects of sleep on memory retrieval without verbal report, illustrating its broad applicability across cognitive research and clinical domains.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Using genetic linkage analysis, we narrowed the associated region to 1cM of the genome and then with a genome editing approach, we show that the mutation, a small complex insertion-deletion, generates a de novo gain-of-function enhancer that drives higher expression of KCNB1 in cardiomyocytes. This is the first report of a gain of de novo enhancer function causing Mendelian disease. Critically, the tissue-specific gain-of-function regulatory change could be predicted using a deep neural network. Application of a similar framework will enable identification of causal non-coding mutations and affected genes in other rare diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572045

The dynamics of traits and trait architectures under stabilizing selection have been extensively studied for single populations at steady state. However, natural populations are seldom at steady state and are often structured in some way. Admixture and introgression events may be common, including over human evolutionary history. Because stabilizing selection results in selection against the minor allele at a trait-affecting locus, alleles from the minor parental ancestry will be selected against after admixture. We show that the site-frequency spectrum can be used to model the genetic architecture of such traits, allowing for the study of trait architecture dynamics in complex multi-population settings. We use a simple deterministic two-locus model to predict the reduction of introgressed ancestry around trait-contributing loci. From this and individual-based simulations, we show that introgressed-ancestry deserts are enriched around such loci. When introgression between two diverged populations occurs in both directions, as has been inferred between humans and Neanderthals, the locations of introgressed-ancestry deserts will tend to be shared across populations. We argue that stabilizing selection for shared phenotypic optima may explain recent observations in which regions of depleted human-introgressed ancestry in the Neanderthal genome overlap with Neanderthal-ancestry deserts in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

To address this, we evaluated the fitness and pathogenesis of contemporary Omicron variants XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, EG.5.1, and JN.1 in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT). We compared in vivo infection in Syrian hamsters with infection in primary human nasal and lung epithelium cells and assessed differences in transmissibility, antigenicity, and innate immune activation. Omicron variants replicated efficiently in the URT but displayed limited pathology in the lungs compared to previous variants and failed to replicate in human lung organoids. JN.1 was attenuated in both URT and LRT compared to other Omicron variants and failed to transmit in the hamster model.

Yet, for many species of corals, a basic understanding of the early life-history stages is lacking. In this study, we report our observations for ex situ reproduction in the massive reef-building coral Porites lobata across two years. Spawning occurred in April and May, on the first day after the full moon with at least two hours of darkness between sunset and moonrise, on a rising tide. Only a small proportion of corals observed had mature gametes or spawned (17-35%). Eggs were 185-311 um in diameter, spherical, homogenous, and provisioned with 95-155 Symbiodiniaceae algae. Males spawned before females, and ex situ fertilization rates were high for the first 2 hours after egg release. P. lobata larvae were elliptical, approximately 300 um long, and symbiotic. Just two days after fertilization, many larvae swam near the bottom of culture dishes and were competent to settle. Settlers began calcification two days after metamorphosis, and tentacles were developed 10 days after attachment. Our observations contrast with previous studies by suggesting an abbreviated pelagic larval period in P. lobata, which could lead to the isolation of some populations. The high thermal tolerance and a broad geographic range of P. lobata suggest this species could locally adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions, especially if larvae are locally retained. The results of this study can inform future work on reproduction, larval biology, dispersal, and recruitment of P. lobata, which could have an ecological advantage over less resilient coral species under future climate change.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

For decades the field has used predominantly male rodents and focused on a sole conditioned fear response: freezing. However, recent work from our lab and others has identified darting as a female-biased conditioned response, characterized by an escape-like movement across a fear conditioning chamber. It is also accompanied by a behavioral phenotype: Darters reliably show decreased freezing compared to Non-darters and males and reach higher velocities in response to the foot shock (shock response). However, the relationship between shock response and conditioned darting is not known. This study investigated if this link is due to differences in general processing of aversive stimuli between Darters, Non-darters and males. Across a variety of modalities, including corticosterone measures, the acoustic startle test, and sensitivity to thermal pain, Darters were found not to be more reactive or sensitive to aversive stimuli, and, in some cases, they appear less reactive to Non-darters and males. Analyses of cFos activity in regions involved in pain and fear processing following fear conditioning identified discrete patterns of expression among Darters, Non-darters, and males exposed to low and high intensity foot shocks. The results from these studies further our understanding of the differences between Darters, Non-darters and males and highlight the importance of studying individual differences in fear conditioning as indicators of fear state.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Next, we deployed GEARBOCS in two test cases. First, we determined that astrocytes are a necessary source of the synaptogenic factor Sparcl1 for thalamocortical synapse maintenance in the mouse primary visual cortex. Second, we determined that cortical astrocytes express the synaptic vesicle associated Vamp2 protein and found that it is required for maintaining excitatory and inhibitory synapse numbers in the visual cortex.

R. parkeri invades host cells, escapes from vacuoles into the cytosol, and undergoes two independent modes of actin-based motility mediated by effectors RickA or Sca2. Actin-based motility of R. parkeri enables bacteria to enter protrusions of the host cell plasma membrane that are engulfed by neighboring host cells. However, whether and how RickA and Sca2 independently contribute to cell-to-cell spread in vitro or pathogenicity in vivo has been unclear. Using live cell imaging of rickA::Tn and sca2::Tn mutants, we discovered both RickA and Sca2 contribute to different modes of cell-to-cell spread. Compared with Sca2-spread, RickA-spread involves the formation of longer protrusions that exhibit larger fluctuations in length and take a longer time to be engulfed into neighboring cells. We further compared the roles of RickA and Sca2 in vivo following intradermal infection of Ifnar1-/-; Ifngr1-/- double-knockout mice, which exhibit eschars and succumb to infection with wild-type R. parkeri. We observed that RickA is important for severe eschar formation, whereas Sca2 contributes to larger foci of infection in the skin and dissemination from the skin to the internal organs. Our results suggest that actin-based motility effectors RickA and Sca2 drive two distinct forms of cell-to-cell spread and contribute differently to pathogenicity in the mammalian host.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Out of the 28,246 clusters identified by DPCstruct, 24% have no structural or sequence similarity to known protein families. Supported by a modular and efficient implementation, classifying 15 million entries in less than 48 hours, DPCstruct is well suited for large-scale proteomics and metagenomics applications. It also facilitates the rapid incorporation of updates from the latest structural prediction tools, thus making sure that the classification is up-to-date.

While immotile in liquid, filament-less and rotation-defective mutants of Salmonella LT2 and E. coli migrate on surfaces at rates comparable to wild-type. In contrast to the ""sliding"" motility reported in many species, the surface migration here does not require but is instead inhibited by surfactant. It is thus a novel form of surface movement that we call ""surfing."" Surfing cells acidify the plates, and surfing is found to depend on the presence of fermentable sugar.

Despite the increased prevalence of experimental studies that interrogate this phenomenon, there remains a lack of applicable quantitative tools to characterise data, and importantly to distinguish between resistance as a discrete phenotype and a (potentially heterogeneous) continuous distribution of phenotypes. To address this, we develop a stochastic individual-based model of adaptive resistance in low-cell-count proliferation assays. That our model corresponds probabilistically to common partial differential equation models of resistance allows us to formulate a likelihood that captures the intrinsic noise ubiquitous to such experiments. We apply our framework to assess the identifiability of key model parameters in several population-level data collection regimes; in particular, parameters relating to the adaptation velocity and within-population heterogeneity. Significantly, we find that heterogeneity is practically non-identifiable from both cell count and proliferation marker data, implying that population-level behaviours may be well characterised by homogeneous ordinary differential equation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that population-level data are insufficient to distinguish resistance as a discrete phenotype from a continuous distribution of phenotypes. Our results inform the design of both future experiments and future quantitative analyses that probe adaptive resistance in cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

To fill this gap, we studied the interactions between the quadruped ANYmal robot and a group of 37 wild vervet monkeys in South Africa. The ANYmal robot is a remote-controlled sheep-sized robot with an open box of food on its back. We gradually introduced the robot to the monkeys following five different steps over 6 days for a total exposition time of about 10h. The monkeys habituated to the robot very quickly with six individuals eating the food in the robots box from the second day. A few individuals, mostly juveniles, emitted alarm calls towards the robot. In total, seven individuals, high rankers, spent time near the robot and 21 monkeys approached the robot from a greater distance. High rankers displayed significantly more vigilant and self-centered behaviors and they, with females and juveniles, ate more food in the robots box compared to low rankers, males, and adults conversely.

We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the true epidemic size, considering increased severity of mpox among MSM living with advanced HIV (MSMLAHIV), documented overrepresentation of people living with HIV (PLHIV) among mpox cases, and HIV prevalence in South Africa. We estimate there have been between 220-450 cases among MSM LHIV in South Africa, implying a total of 290-560 cases among all MSM. We provide an upper bound of 750-1,600 cases as a sensitivity analysis where the prevalence of HIV among mpox patients is the same as population prevalence among MSM in South Africa. Estimates in both scenarios suggest a substantial number of undetected cases, with case ascertainment rates estimated between 1% and 8%.

Our study revealed significant species-specific variations in cell types, highlighting their conservation and diversification in evolution. We found pronounced differences in telencephalon excitatory neurons (EX) and cerebellar cell types between birds and mammals. Birds predominantly express SLC17A6 in EX, whereas mammals expressed SLC17A7 in neocortex and SLC17A6 elsewhere, possibly due to loss of SLC17A7 function loss in birds. Additionally, we identified a novel bird-specific Purkinje cell subtype (SVIL+), implicating the LSD11/KDM1A pathway in learning and circadian rhythms, and related numerous positively selected genes in birds, suggesting an evolutionary optimization of cerebellar functions for ecological and behavioral adaptation.

Here, we introduce the Visium HD platform (10x Genomics) and use it to investigate human CRC and normal adjacent mucosal tissues from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. The first assay available on Visium HD is a probe-based spatial transcriptomics workflow that was developed to enable whole transcriptome single cell scale analysis. We demonstrate highly refined unsupervised spatial clustering in Visium HD data that aligns with the hallmarks of colon tissue morphology and is notably improved over earlier Visium assays. Using serial sections from the same FFPE blocks we generate a single cell atlas of our samples, then we integrate the data to comprehensively characterize the immune cell types present in the TME, specifically at the tumor periphery. We observed enrichment of two pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations with differential gene expression profiles that were localized within distinct tumor regions. Further characterization of the T cells present in one of the samples revealed a clonal expansion that we were able to localize in the tissue using in situ gene expression analysis. In situ analysis also allowed us to perform in-depth characterization of the microenvironment of the clonally expanded T cell population and we identified a third macrophage subpopulation with gene expression profiles consistent with an anti-tumor response. Our study provides a comprehensive map of the cellular composition of the CRC TME and identifies phenotypically and spatially distinct immune cell populations within it. We show that the single cell-scale resolution afforded by Visium HD and the whole transcriptome nature of the assay allows investigations into cellular function and interaction at the tumor periphery in FFPE tissues, which has not been previously possible.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Recent evidence suggests that pathological changes in skeletal muscle may contribute significantly to ongoing pain and fatigue, particularly post-exertional malaise. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PASC-related fatigue by examining skeletal muscle function and circulating factors in affected individuals.

We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of patients with fatigue-associated PASC who had experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and content in PASC participants compared to healthy controls. This lower respiratory capacity was accompanied by markedly elevated circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (sIL2R), a T cell-specific receptor.

In vitro experiments demonstrated that sIL2R directly impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces mitochondrial complex III subunit protein levels in cultured muscle cells. These findings suggest a mechanism linking systemic immune dysregulation to muscle-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC.

This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of PASC identifying sIL2R as a promising therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial deficits in PASC-related fatigue and opening avenues for developing targeted interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572045

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) afflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD. To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of healthy sedentary individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in healthy sedentary individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals. Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise. For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology. Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention. Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that healthy sedentary individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions. Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha).

Key to this are activation domains, which often fall within disordered regions of transcription factors and recruit co-activators to initiate transcription. These interactions are difficult to characterize via most experimental techniques because they are typically weak and transient. Consequently, we know very little about whether these interactions are promiscuous or specific, the mechanisms of binding, and how these interactions tune the strength of gene activation. To address these questions, we developed a microfluidic platform for expression and purification of hundreds of activation domains in parallel followed by direct measurement of co-activator binding affinities (STAMMPPING, for Simultaneous Trapping of Affinity Measurements via a Microfluidic Protein-Protein INteraction Generator). By applying STAMMPPING to quantify direct interactions between eight co-activators and 204 human activation domains (>1,500 Kds), we provide the first quantitative map of these interactions and reveal 334 novel binding pairs. We find that the metazoan-specific co-activator P300 directly binds >100 activation domains, potentially explaining its widespread recruitment across the genome to influence transcriptional activation. Despite sharing similar molecular properties (e.g. enrichment of negative and hydrophobic residues), activation domains utilize distinct biophysical properties to recruit certain co-activator domains. Co-activator domain affinity and occupancy are well-predicted by analytical models that account for multivalency, and in vitro affinities quantitatively predict activation in cells with an ultrasensitive response. Not only do our results demonstrate the ability to measure affinities between even weak protein-protein interactions in high throughput, but they also provide a necessary resource of over 1,500 activation domain/co-activator affinities which lays the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of transcriptional activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572045

As sequences unfold, encountering a context shift, or event boundary, triggers arousal and LC processes that predict later memory separation. Boundaries furthermore promote temporal pattern separation within left hippocampal dentate gyrus, which correlates with heightened LC responses to those same transition points. We also find that a neurochemical index of prolonged LC activation correlates with diminished arousal responses at boundaries, suggesting a connection between elevated LC output and impaired event processing. These findings align with the idea that arousal processes initiate a neural and memory  reset in response to significant changes, constructing the very episodes that define everyday memory.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Here we reveal in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that two distinct oscillatory systems for the phytohormone auxin coordinate the spatial and temporal identity of PBS, jointly defining the lateral root density. We followed auxin signalling dynamics for days and thereby detected a systemic auxin signal oscillating in the mature primary root, which is distinct from the previously described root clock at the root tip. While the root clock spatially primes the PBS in the growing root tip, the systemic oscillatory auxin signal temporally controls the auxin-dependent identity of these PBS. Light perception in the shoot defines the strength of the systemic auxin signal and thereby controls the auxin-reliant ability of PBSs to develop into lateral roots. Moreover, PHYB and CRY1 mediate the light-dependent integration of other environmental signals, such as ambient temperature, into the control systemic auxin signalling and lateral root density.

High-accuracy, long-read sequencing can substantially improve SV characterization when coupled with effective calling methods. While state-of the-art long-read SV callers are highly accurate, further improvements are achievable by systematically modeling local haplotypes during SV discovery and genotyping. Results We describe sawfish, an SV caller for mapped high-quality long reads incorporating systematic SV haplotype modeling to improve accuracy and resolution. Assessment against the draft Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) SV benchmark from the T2T-HG002-Q100 diploid assembly shows that sawfish has the highest accuracy among state-of-the-art long-read SV callers across every tested SV size group. Additionally, sawfish maintains the highest accuracy at every tested depth level from 10 to 32-fold coverage, such that other callers required at least 30-fold coverage to match sawfish accuracy at 15-fold coverage. Sawfish also shows the highest accuracy in the GIAB challenging medically relevant genes benchmark, demonstrating improvements in both comprehensive and medically relevant contexts. When joint-genotyping 10 samples from CEPH-1463, sawfish has over 9000 more pedigree-concordant calls than other state-of-the-art SV callers, with the highest proportion of concordant SVs (78%) as well. Sawfish's quality model can be used to select for an even higher proportion of concordant SVs (86%), while still calling over 5000 more pedigree-concordant SVs than other callers. These results demonstrate that sawfish improves on the state-of-the-art for long-read SV calling accuracy across both individual and joint-sample analyses.

Here we present the cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of a human AGO-guide complex bound to a fully paired target, revealing structural rearrangements that enable this conformation. Critically, the N domain of AGO rotates to allow the RNA full access to the central channel and forms contacts that license rapid slicing.

We identified distinct clonal expansions and distributions in blood compared to tonsils, with surprisingly low (1-7%) clonal sharing.

Analysis of antigen-specific CD8 T cells revealed location as a main determinant of frequency, phenotype, and immunodominance.

Each of the two genomes were broken up into 100-kB segments, each of which was searched for matches to a large set of porcine queries. All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome.

ResultsIn scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds).

Parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis were conducted to refine the model`s accuracy. The model effectively reproduces moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 progressions, consistent with experimental observations. We investigated the efficiency and contributions of innate and adaptive immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed immune system behavior during co-infection with HIV and organ transplantation.

However, the behavior and neural representation of ambivalent feelings, particularly during awe, remain elusive. To address this gap, we combined awe-inducing virtual reality clips, electroencephalogram, and a deep learning-based dimensionality reduction technique (N = 43). Behaviorally, awe ratings were precisely predicted by the duration and intensity of ambivalent feelings, not by single valence metrics. In the electrophysiological analysis, we identified participant- and clip-specific latent neural spaces sharing valence representation structures across individuals and stimuli. In these spaces, ambivalent feelings during awe were distinctly represented, and the variability in their distinctiveness specifically predicted awe ratings. Additionally, frontal delta oscillations mainly engaged in differentiating valence representations. Our findings demonstrate that awe is fundamentally an ambivalent experience reflected in both behavior and distinct patterns of electrophysiological activity. This work provides a new framework for understanding complex emotions and their neural underpinnings, with potential implications for affective neuroscience and mental health research.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Indeed, a major challenge is that variants do not act in isolation but rather in the framework of highly complex biological networks, such as the human metabolic network, which can amplify or buffer the effect of specific risk alleles on disease susceptibility. In our previous work, we established that metabolic models can be leveraged to simulate the emerging metabolic effects of genetically driven variation in transcript levels and estimate personalized metabolic reaction fluxes. Here we use genetically predicted reaction fluxes to perform a systematic search for metabolic fluxes acting as buffers or amplifiers of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk alleles. Our analysis identifies 30 risk locus - reaction flux pairs with significant interaction on CAD susceptibility involving 18 individual reaction fluxes and 8 independent risk loci. Notably, many of these reactions are linked to processes with putative roles in the disease such as the metabolism of inflammatory mediators and fatty acids. In summary, this work establishes proof of concept that biochemical reaction fluxes can have non-additive effects with risk alleles and provides novel insights into the interplay between metabolism and genetic variation on disease susceptibility.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572045

To contribute to the inward Ca2+ flux that drives Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release, CaV1.2 channels must be expressed on the sarcolemma; thus the regulatory mechanisms that tune CaV1.2 expression to meet contractile demand are an emerging area of research. A ubiquitously expressed protein called 14-3-3 has been proposed to affect Ca2+ channel trafficking in non-myocytes, however whether 14-3-3 has similar effects on CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. 14-3-3 preferentially binds phospho-serine/threonine residues to affect many cellular processes and is known to regulate cardiac ion channels including NaV1.5 and hERG. Altered 14-3-3 expression and function have been implicated in cardiac pathologies including hypertrophy. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and regulates cardiac CaV1.2 trafficking and recycling. Confocal imaging, proximity ligation assays, super-resolution imaging, and co-immunoprecipitation revealed a population of 14-3-3 colocalized and closely associated with CaV1.2. The degree of 14-3-3/CaV1.2 colocalization increased upon stimulation of {beta}-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Notably, only the 14-3-3-associated CaV1.2 population displayed increased cluster size with isoproterenol, revealing a role for 14-3-3 as a nucleation factor that directs CaV1.2 super-clustering. 14-3-3 overexpression increased basal CaV1.2 cluster size and Ca2+ currents in ventricular myocytes, with maintained channel responsivity to isoproterenol. In contrast, isoproterenol-stimulated augmentation of sarcolemmal CaV1.2 expression and currents in ventricular myocytes were abrogated by 14-3-3 inhibition. These data support a model where 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to promote enhanced trafficking/recycling, clustering, and activity during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation.

Significance StatementThe L-type Ca2+ channel, CaV1.2, plays an essential role in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart and in part regulates the overall strength of contraction during basal and fight- or-flight {beta}-adrenergic signaling conditions. Proteins that modulate the trafficking and/or activity of CaV1.2 are interesting both from a physiological and pathological perspective, since alterations in CaV1.2 can impact action potential duration and cause arrythmias. A small protein called 14-3-3 regulates other ion channels in the heart and other Ca2+ channels, but how it may interact with CaV1.2 in the heart has never been studied. Examining factors that affect CaV1.2 at rest and during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation is crucial for our ability to understand and treat disease and aging conditions where these pathways are altered.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Crop root systems are critical for water uptake and nutrient acquisition, which impacts yield. Quantitative trait phenotyping is essential to understand better the genetic factors underpinning maize root growth and development. Root systems are challenging to phenotype given their below-ground, soil-bound nature. In addition, manual trait annotations of root images are tedious and can lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies between individuals, resulting in data discrepancies. To address these issues, we have developed an automated phenotyping pipeline for field-grown maize crown roots by leveraging open-source software. Phenotypic variation of 20 maize genotypes from the Wisconsin Diversity panel was significant for numerous root traits, suggesting a genetic basis for the observed developmental deviations. In addition, juvenile root traits from controlled environment conditions exhibited inconsistent correlation with field-grown adult root traits, underscoring the developmental plasticity prevalent during maize root morphogenesis. Transcripts involved in hormone signaling and stress responses were among differentially expressed genes in roots from 20 maize genotypes, suggesting many molecular processes may underlie the observed phenotypic variance. This study furthers our understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships, which is relevant for informing agricultural strategies to improve maize root physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Cells lost by abrasion are replaced by division of both corneal epithelial cells and populations of stem cells around the corneal periphery, the limbus. Limbal-derived epithelial cells migrate into the cornea, retaining equal cell loss and replacement rates (the  XYZ hypothesis). This process leads to a striking stable spiral cell motion pattern across the corneal surface, with a central vortex. Here, we show that the emergence of the spiral pattern can be explained by the interplay of the position of the limbus, cell division, extrusion, and collective cell migration along the curved surface of the cornea. Using dissected LacZ mosaic murine corneas, we inferred the flow field on the curved surface by following stripe edges, revealing a tightening spiral. To explain the flow fields, we developed a cell-level, in silico model of the mouse cornea. Corneal epithelial cells were treated as mechanically soft, self-propelled particles with density-dependent proliferation and extrusion rates, and noisy alignment of the direction of migration. Even without any global guidance cues, the model predicted that migration patterns form stripes and spirals closely recapitulating those in the experiment. To understand the origin and properties of this flow field, we complemented the particle-based model with a continuum description of cell flux on the cornea that generalises the XYZ hypothesis of steady-state balance between cell divisions and extrusions. The work, therefore, demonstrates how the physics of swarms on curved surfaces can provide quantitative explanations of biological processes at the tissue scale.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

However, naturally occurring AAV serotypes are limited in their ability to target skeletal muscle, an important gene therapy target for many neuromuscular disorders. This means that high doses of AAV are often required to achieve therapeutically effective doses in muscle. To overcome this, novel AAV vector capsids have been engineered by inserting targeting peptides into the AAV9 capsid variable region VIII (VRIII) to achieve greater muscle transduction efficiency. Here we describe investigation of a newly reported capsid, called MyoAAV1A combined with clinically validated muscle-specific promoters. We profiled the efficiency of in vivo delivery to murine skeletal muscle and found that the optimal combination of MyoAAV1A capsid with MHCK7 promoter maintains transgene expression in skeletal muscle, and reduces expression in off-target tissues, particularly the liver. This highlights a promising capsid-promoter combination to progress in further preclinical research for skeletal muscle gene therapy.

Despite this, the origin and ultrastructure of cytosolic TDP43 deposits remain unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal RNA homeostasis can drive pathological TDP43 mislocalization, enhancing RNA misprocessing due to loss of nuclear TDP43 and engendering a cycle that ends in cell death. Here, we show that adding small monovalent oligonucleotides successfully recapitulates pathological TDP43 mislocalization and aggregation in iPSC-derived neurons (iNeurons). By employing a multimodal in situ cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy pipeline, we examine how RNA influences the localization and aggregation of TDP43 in near-native conditions. We find that mislocalized TDP43 forms ordered fibrils within lysosomes and autophagosomes in iNeurons as well as in patient tissue, and provide the first high-resolution snapshots of TDP43 aggregates in situ. In so doing, we provide a cellular model for studying initial pathogenic events underlying ALS, FTLD, and related TDP43-proteinopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

While important, the development of the hippocampus in the formative period of childhood and adolescence has not been extensively investigated, with most contemporary research focusing on macrostructural measures of volume. Thus, there has been little research on the development of the micron-scale structures (i.e., microstructure) of the hippocampus, which engender its cognitive functions. The current study examined age-related changes of hippocampal microstructure using diffusion MRI data acquired with an ultra-strong gradient (300 mT/m) MRI scanner in a sample of children and adolescents (N=88; 8-19 years). Surface-based hippocampal modelling was combined with established microstructural approaches, such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion Density Imaging (NODDI), and a more advanced gray matter diffusion model Soma And Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI). No significant changes in macrostructural measures (volume, gyrification, and thickness) were found between 8-19 years, while significant changes in microstructure measures related to neurites (from NODDI and SANDI), soma (from SANDI), and mean diffusivity (from DTI) were found. In particular, there was a significant increase across age in neurite MR signal fraction and a significant decrease in extracellular MR signal fraction and mean diffusivity across the hippocampal subfields and long-axis. A significant negative correlation between age and MR apparent soma radius was found in the subiculum and CA1 throughout the anterior and body of the hippocampus. Further surface-based analyses uncovered variability in age-related microstructural changes between the subfields and long-axis, which may reflect ostensible developmental differences along these two axes. Finally, correlation of hippocampal surfaces representing age-related changes of microstructure with maps derived from histology allowed for postulation of the potential underlying microstructure that diffusion changes across age may be capturing. Overall, distinct neurite and soma developmental profiles in the human hippocampus during late childhood and adolescence are reported for the first time.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

We propose doing this computationally using Ancestral State Reconstruction (ASR) over phylogenetic trees. Bayesian phylogenetic trees have shown promise as a tool to study the evolution of chant melodies, by inferring a plausible topology of chant transmission. However, the inferred trees cannot be used as ASR inputs directly, because they are undirected, and their branch lengths conflate time and evolutionary rate. We therefore first apply Divergence Time Estimation (DTE) to separate them and represent the tree in a directed form on the time dimension. Using ASR, we then obtain reconstructions of melodies for each of the ancestral nodes, in addition to their distribution in time obtained from DTE, and thus we obtain a phylogeny of chant melody with a music-historical interpretation. We applied this method to the Christmas Vespers dataset, and compare the results against musicological knowledge and melodies reconstructed at Solesmes using methods of contemporary philology, which shows potential for reconstructing cultural transmission through time.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

MethodsWe generated a model of reduced dietary obesity (ReDO) whereby male mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice were calorically restricted until weight matched to control mice, and then after a 24-hour food assessment period were pair-fed relative to control mice. We subsequently generated ReDO mice that, after CR were pair-fed relative to control mice for 0, 8, or 28 days, or chronically. Body weight, food intake, and select metabolic parameters were measured, along with whole hypothalamic Pomc gene expression.

ResultsReDO mice in both experiments exhibited hyperphagia following CR, while a persistent form of hyperphagia was detected in ReDO_8d and ReDO_28d mice relative to control and chronically pair-fed mice. 4-week initial weight gain was predictive of the degree of weight regain across ReDO_8 and ReDO_28 mice.

ConclusionsReDO mice exhibit a long-lived form of hyperphagia and an apparent drive to reclaim an upwardly shifted body weight set point. There was considerable variability with regard to ReDO_8 and ReDO_28 body weight regain which was correlated with the of initial degree of 4-week body-weight gain when first exposed to a high-fat diet. This study showcases the perdurance of weight loss-associated hyperphagia and introduces a prognostic tool for identifying mice that are prone towards weight regain, while setting the stage for future inquiries into the neurobiological basis of persistent hunger following weight loss owed to a dietary intervention in mice.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

The underlying mechanisms for this observation are still unknown. Sensory neurons transmit noxious signals from inflamed joints to the central nervous system, where a pain percept is generated. We investigated whether JAKi exert direct effects on sensory neurons. Methods: In-house and public RNA sequencing datasets of sensory neurons were analysed for relevant JAK/STAT and cytokine-receptor gene expression. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC)-derived sensory neurons were stimulated with serum and synovial fluid (SF) from individuals with RA, or with selected cytokines that were found in RA SF by Luminex. Phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) was assessed by Western blot. Sensory neuron activation was examined by recording neuronal firing using multi-electrode array and measuring expression levels of pain-relevant genes with STAT3-binding sites. Results: Cell-free RA synovial fluid induced pSTAT3 in IPSC-derived sensory neurons, an effect which was completely blocked by the JAKi tofacitinib. Compared to paired serum, RA SF was enriched for the JAK/STAT cytokines IL-6, IL-11, LIF, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, with their requisite receptors present on sensory neurons. Stimulation of IPSC-derived sensory neurons with these recombinant cytokines recapitulated pSTAT3 induction in these cells. Furthermore, IL-6+sIL-6R or LIF upregulated expression of pain-relevant genes which was blocked by tofacitinib. Finally, we provided evidence that LIF can induce neuronal sensitisation. Conclusion: Our data indicate that JAKi can act directly on sensory neurons, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for their suggested superior analgesic properties.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572045

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572046

AlphaFold2 predictions revealed that RPA and TPP1 interact with telomerase at distinct binding sites. Using separation- of-function mutants, we discovered that RPA-mediated telomerase stimulation is indispensable for telomere elongation, while TPP1-POT1 primarily functions in recruiting telomerase to telomeres. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short telomere disease-associated telomerase mutations compromise RPAs ability to stimulate telomerase, establishing a link between impaired RPA-dependent processivity and telomeropathies. Our findings redefine human telomerase regulation by establishing RPA as a critical regulator and provide new insights into the molecular basis of telomere-related diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572046

Large-scale studies have been able to detect genetic variants with contributions to height in the range of approximately 1.2 millimetre per allele copy on average. Non-additive genetic interactions may, in part, account for the difference between broad-sense and narrow-sense heritability estimates. However, prior studies have failed to identify variants with non-additive effects, possibly due to the lack of statistical power. Leveraging 3.6M individuals of European genetic ancestry in the 23andMe research cohort, we performed a genome-wide analysis study (GWAS) to select 1,063 independent common SNPs associated with height (p-value < 5e-8), and then screened for evidence of non-additive effects by analysing 564,453 models including a pairwise SNP-SNP interaction term. We identified 69 pairwise models with suggestive evidence of SNP-SNP interaction (p-value < 1e-4) and, for each SNP pair, we evaluated a fully saturated model including additive, dominant, and epistatic (additive-by-additive, additive-by-dominance and dominance-by-dominance) terms. We tested for the presence of epistatic interactions by comparing models with and without epistatic terms using a likelihood ratio test. Assuming a strict Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 8.9e-8 (0.05/564,453), we found no evidence of epistatic interactions (Likelihood ratio test (LRT) p-value < 9e-07 for all models). Our analysis rules out the existence of epistatic interactions between alleles of >1% frequency with effect sizes larger than 2.42mm.

We hypothesised that the isoforms functionally alter microglia by shaping their transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We used RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia isolated from a xenotransplantation model of AD. We identified widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype, and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoforms protective role.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572046

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572046

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness.

The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572046

As the zebrafish embryo grows into a larva, to improve its heart function, the embryonic myocardial wall transforms into an intricate 3D architecture, composed of an outer compact layer enveloping an inner layer of multicellular trabecular ridges. How these tissue layers acquire their characteristic form suited for their function remains an open question. Here, we find that multiscale mechanochemical coupling and an emergent tissue-scale morphological transition steer functional maturation of the developing zebrafish heart. Single-celled trabecular seeds recruit outer compact layer cells to mature into clonally heterogenous multicellular ridges, thereby amplifying cardiac contractile forces. In response, remaining compact layer cells are stretched, which impedes their further recruitment, thereby constraining trabecular ridge density. Concomitantly, Notch-dependent actomyosin dampening triggers a sharp transition in myocardial tissue area, activating rapid organ growth that expands blood filling capacity. Thus, multiscale self-organizing interactions optimize heart size and contractile efficiency to support embryonic life.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572046

In this study, we computationally model 1,804 protein complexes consisting of various H5 isolates from 1959 to 2024 against 11 HA1-neutralizing antibodies. This study shows a trend of weakening of the binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape of our medical defenses. We also found that based on the wide variety of host species and geographic locations in which H5N1 was observed to have been transmitted from birds to mammals, there is not a single central reservoir host species or location associated with H5N1s spread. These results indicate that the virus is well on its way to moving from epidemic to pandemic status in the near future.

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1724364572046

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1724364572046
