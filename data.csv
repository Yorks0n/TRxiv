However, the role of condensates in driving disease etiology remains poorly understood. Here, we identify myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2) as a disease-agnostic biomarker for phase transitions, including stress granules and nuclear condensates associated with dystonia. Exploiting fluorophore-derivatized MLF2 constructs, we developed a high-content platform and computational pipeline to screen modulators of NE condensates across chemical and genetic space. We identified RNF26 and ZNF335 as protective factors that prevent the buildup of nuclear condensates sequestering K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. Chemical screening identified four FDA-approved drugs that potently modulate condensates by resolving polyubiquitinated cargo and MLF2 accumulation. Our exploratory integrated chemical-genetics approach suggests that modulation of zinc, and potentially autophagy and oxidative stress, is critical for condensate modulation and nuclear proteostasis, offering potential therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. Application of our platform to a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen identified strong enrichment of candidate genes linked to primary microcephaly and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Two hypomorphic microcephaly-associated alleles of ZNF335 failed to rescue nuclear condensate accumulation in ZNF335 KO cells, suggesting that aberrant condensates and impaired nuclear proteostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of microcephaly.

Each sense organ is composed of two glial cells, called the sheath and socket, and one or more neurons. A major challenge in studying their development has been the lack of methods to directly observe these structures in the embryo. Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid (AM), four cephalic (CEP), six inner labial (IL), four outer labial quadrant (OLQ), and two outer labial lateral (OLL)). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then ""zippers"" down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath-socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships. This study demonstrates the value of large public EM datasets that can be mined for new insights, and sheds light on how neurons and glia undergo coordinated morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

Cyclic peptides offer greater stability and potential oral delivery, but their de novo design with computational methods as agonists is unproven. Here, we used the EvoBind AI platform to design cyclic peptide agonists for GCGR from sequence alone, without any structural templates or prior binding site information. EvoBind consistently identified the receptors activation surface, producing peptides that also activated GLP1R. Of three synthesised peptides, two showed potent dual activation of GCGR and GLP1R in cAMP assays, while all three activate GLP1R, with the 18-residue design achieving EC50 values of 32 nM (GLP1R) and 542 nM (GCGR), rivalling natural hormones. The designed sequences show no similarity to known agonists, and structural modelling indicates that they adopt novel binding modes compatible with active-state stabilisation. This is made possible by EvoBinds purely sequence-based, template-free approach, which enables the discovery of alternative solutions that are inaccessible to structure-guided methods. This study presents the first successful blind de novo design of a cyclic peptide agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), using only the receptor sequence as input. The findings highlight EvoBinds capacity to go beyond static binding, offering a generalisable strategy for therapeutic discovery through target-agnostic, sequence-driven peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

These experiments are currently conducted by thousands of high school students and can offer an unprecedented window into biofilm adaptation while building a community of young researchers. Providing high school students access to research experiences improves learning and can have positive and long-lasting impacts on their attitudes towards science. Moreover, student research can make impactful scientific contributions. Through EvolvingSTEM, students evolve populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens in a biofilm bead model and observe heritable changes in colony morphology. Genome sequencing of 70 mutants that they picked identified parallel mutations in genes known to regulate biofilm growth (wsp, yfiBNR, morA, fuzY). We also uncovered novel adaptations: loss-of-function mutations in phosphodiesterase PFLU0185 that did not alter colony morphology, and mutations affecting periplasmic disulfide bond formation producing small colonies. PFLU0185 mutations consistently reached high frequencies and phenotyping revealed roles in cyclic di-GMP regulation, biofilm formation, and motility, prompting us to name this gene bmo (biofilm and motility optimizer). Competition experiments and microscopy demonstrated bmo mutants employ generalist strategies and coexist with the ancestor and specialist mutants through niche differentiation. Consequently, phenotypic diversity is maintained, with smooth (ancestral and bmo) colonies consistently outnumbering wrinkly and fuzzy variants. The study advances understanding of biofilm genetic architecture while demonstrating that student-led research can uncover mechanisms of microbial adaptation relevant to Pseudomonas infection biology and provide transformative STEM experiences.

IMPORTANCEBacterial biofilms dominate microbial life, yet their evolutionary genetics remain incompletely understood. This science education project engages thousands of high school students in experimental evolution, yielding discoveries about biofilm adaptation while transforming their science education. Selected mutants included PFLU0185/bmo, a conserved phosphodiesterase that helps bacteria balance the competing demands of attachment and dispersal essential for biofilm life cycle success. The finding that smooth-colony generalists rather than conspicuous variants dominate biofilm adaptation adds to our understanding of the process of niche differentiation in biofilms. This work also demonstrates the power of distributed research networks for discovery of new genetic pathways of adaptation. Students gained authentic research experience, potentially inspiring them to join the next generation of scientists, while identifying mutants adapted to discrete conditions that maintain diversity within biofilms. This synergy between education and discovery offers a scalable model for addressing complex biological questions while developing scientific literacy in diverse classrooms.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

Further, to explore the potential influence of local population distribution on individuality, we also examined isolated males without neighbours and clumped males with neighbours. Our findings indicate higher individuality at higher densities across both scenarios, measured using two individuality metrics: Beechers information statistic and Discrimination score. Additionally, clumped males exhibited significantly lower acoustic niche overlaps compared to isolated males, suggesting that the immediate social environment might be more influential than larger-scale population density patterns. This study is the first to demonstrate that vocal individuality in a territorial species is influenced by conspecific density, similar to findings in group-living and colonial species.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1749593357929

While there are hundreds of diverse GPCRs, only two {beta}-arrestin isoforms ({beta}arrs) must recognize and engage this wide range of receptors with varied phosphorylation patterns. Traditional models suggest that {beta}arr activation requires displacement of its autoinhibitory C-tail by a phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus; however, this paradigm fails to explain how minimally phosphorylated GPCRs still complex with {beta}arrs. Using single-molecule F&oumlrster resonance energy transfer imaging and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we observe basal dynamics in which the {beta}arr1 C-tail spontaneously releases from the N-domain, transiently adopting an active conformation that can facilitate binding of the phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus. We further demonstrate the importance of an intermediate state of {beta}arr1 arising from spontaneous C-tail release stabilized by the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2. Both PI(4,5)P2 and mutations in the proximal or middle regions of the C-tail shift {beta}arr1 towards a partially released state, revealing an allosteric connection that informs a refined model for {beta}arr activation. In this model, membrane engagement conformationally primes {beta}arrs prior to receptor binding, thereby explaining how {beta}arrs are recruited by diverse GPCRs, even those with limited C-terminal phosphorylation.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

In mammals, the menthol receptor, TRPM8, is activated by temperatures below ~26{degrees}C and is essential for the perception of cold or chemical cooling agents. A fascinating, yet still unachieved goal is to elucidate structural mechanisms whereby TRPM8 or other thermosensitive channels are gated by changes in ambient temperature. Recent studies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have attempted to address this challenging question but are limited by difficulties in visualizing temperature-evoked conformational substates or assessing the energetic landscape governing gating transitions. Here, we close this gap by using cryo-EM to visualize TRPM8 channels in cellular membranes, where bona fide menthol- and cold-evoked open states are captured. We identify a novel semi-swapped architecture in which interdigitation of channel subunits is substantially rearranged following repositioning of the S6 transmembrane helix and elements of the pore region. By combining this structural analysis with thermodynamic measurements using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we are able to pinpoint the pore and TRP helices as key regions undergoing stimulus-evoked conformational dynamics that drive channel gating. Structural mechanisms associated with activation are validated by comparison of human TRPM8 with the menthol-sensitive, but relatively cold-insensitive avian orthologue. We propose a free energy landscape to explain channel gating by cold or cooling agents.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

This broadband activity indicates spontaneous fluctuations in excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance across vigilance states and has recently been shown to systematically covary across the respiratory cycle during waking resting state. We used simultaneous EEG and respiratory recordings over a full night of sleep collected from N = 23 healthy participants to unravel the nested dynamics of respiration phase-locked excitability states across the wake-sleep cycle. We demonstrate a prominent phase shift in the coupling of aperiodic brain activity to respiratory rhythms as participants were transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. Moreover, respiration-brain coupling became more consistent both across and within participants, as interindividual as well as intraindividual variability systematically lessened from wakefulness and the transition to sleep towards deeper sleep stages. Our results suggest that respiration phase-locked changes in E:I balance conceivably add to sleep stage-specific neural signatures of REM and NREM sleep, highlighting the complexity of brain-body coupling during sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

We used this system to study the quantitative relationship between Wnt signaling in space and time and the resulting AP patterns. We found that rather than a smoothly varying gradient along the axis, signaling is elevated in midbrain compared to either surrounding region. The timing, rather than the amplitude or duration, of the Wnt response played the most important role in setting axial coordinates. These results establish a simple system for studying the patterning of the human nervous system and elucidate how cells interpret Wnt dynamics to determine their position along the AP axis.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

Using a live reporter of BMP pathway activity and nascent transcription reporters, we find that gene expression is best predicted by time integration of BMP signaling, rather than instantaneous levels. However, in sog mutant embryos with broad BMP activity, integration alone fails to predict gene expression outside the normal domain. We show that the transcription factor Zen lowers the signaling threshold required for activation, enabling integration to drive rapid transcriptional responses even at low BMP levels. Together, these results suggest that cells interpret dynamic morphogen signals through the combined action of temporal integration and spatial competence, providing a framework for robust pattern formation on fast developmental timescales.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

Our approach combines CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome engineering with a cleavable recombinant probe, which addresses many of the shortcomings of current methodologies. We demonstrate the capabilities our method by studying the internalization behavior of a previously uncharacterized surface protein and by assessing the effect of ligands and activity modulators in the endocytic behavior of established receptors.

We describe a novel mechanism whereby JIP4 regulates lysosomal cystine storage by controlling the abundance of cystinosin (CTNS), the transporter responsible for lysosomal cystine efflux. To this end, JIP4, previously characterized as a motor adaptor and kinase signaling scaffold, suppresses TMEM55B-dependent ubiquitylation of CTNS. Loss of JIP4 reduces CTNS protein levels, leading to lysosomal cystine accumulation and lysosomal storage defects that phenocopy loss of CTNS in both human cells and the renal proximal tubules of JIP4 knockout mice. These phenotypes mirror cystinosis, the lysosomal storage disease caused by CTNS loss-of-function. Our findings thus reveal a fundamental process that controls the efflux of lysosomal cystine and has relevance to understanding human disease arising from JIP4 mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1749593357929

BMP-dependent patterning of the secondary body axis is ancestral for Bilateria and possibly also for the bilaterian sister clade Cnidaria. However, the variety of levels of centralization of the nervous systems in Bilateria - from diffuse to fully centralized - as well as the lack of centralization of the nervous system in Cnidaria, suggest that BMP signaling cannot be perceived as a universally ""anti-neural"" signal. Here we use transgenic reporter lines in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella to show that BMP signaling is active in distinct neuronal populations. Moreover, attenuation of BMP signaling followed by RNA-Seq shows that BMP signaling is a positive regulator of many neuronal genes, including the top-tier neural progenitor marker soxB(2). Further, we analyze BMP signaling activity in the true jellyfish Aurelia and box jellyfish Tripedalia proving that BMP signaling in the diffuse cnidarian nervous system is not an anthozoan but an ancestral cnidarian feature, shared by anthozoans and medusozoans. Finally, we show that the highly centralized ventral nervous system of the non-model spiralian, the chaetognath Spadella, forms out of paired BMP signaling-positive domains on the lateral sides of the embryo. Together, our data suggest that one of the ancestral roles of BMP signaling was in promoting neurogenesis.

The plant CLV3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) small-signaling peptide family exemplifies these challenges. Although genetic studies in model systems have identified shared roles for a few CLE genes and species-specific redundancies, an evolutionary analysis of the entire family over deep time could empower predictive and experimental dissections of functions obscured by redundancy. We developed a scanning pipeline that de novo annotated CLE genes from 2,000 genomes representing 1,000 species, uncovering thousands of previously undetected family members and producing a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction and tracing of the family's evolution and sequence diversification over 140 million years. Computational modeling of coding and cis-regulatory regions predicted lineage-specific asymmetries in paralog redundancy, stemming from ancestral amino acids in the functional core of the dodecapeptide and partial conservation of promoter elements. We tested these predictions using two genome-editing strategies in Solanaceae. Base-editing of deeply conserved residues in the CLV3 dodecapeptide and its paralogs across three species confirmed their critical roles in repressing stem-cell proliferation, and multiplex CRISPR knockouts of the 52 tomato CLE genes resolved pairwise and higher-order redundancies, revealing previously uncharacterized regulators of shoot architecture and plant size. These findings show how both peptide and cis-regulatory erosion shape CLE redundancy and provide a framework for detecting and translating deep evolutionary signals into testable genetic hypotheses across compositionally complex gene families.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

However, the quantitative contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to cancer transcriptome dynamics remains unclear. Here, we systematically measured mRNA dynamics across diverse breast cancer models, revealing that mRNA stability significantly shapes gene expression variability. To decipher the regulatory grammar underlying these dynamics, we developed GreyHound, an interpretable multimodal deep-learning framework integrating RNA sequence features and RNA-binding protein (RBP) expression. GreyHound identified an extensive network of RBPs and their regulons underlying variations in mRNA stability. Among these, we uncovered a metastasis-suppressive regulatory axis centered on the RNA-binding protein RBMS3 and its post-transcriptional control of the redox regulator TXNIP. Functional and molecular analyses revealed that RBMS3 depletion resulted in targeted transcript destabilization, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes and enhanced metastatic potential in xenograft models. Using in vivo epistasis studies, we confirmed that RBMS3 regulation of TXNIP mRNA stability drives this metastasis-suppressive program. These findings position the RBMS3-TXNIP regulatory axis as a key post-transcriptional mechanism in breast cancer and illustrate how interpretable models of RNA dynamics can uncover hidden regulatory programs in disease.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

Transdiagnostic associations between CM and brain deviation scores were evaluated within each sex and age cohort.

PTHrP has been clinically implicated as a putative regulator of cachexia, with serum PTHrP levels correlating with increased weight loss in PDAC patients. Here we show that cachectic PDAC patients have high expression of tumor PTHrP and use a genetically engineered mouse model to functionally demonstrate that deletion of Pthlh (encoding the PTHrP protein) blocks cachectic wasting, dramatically extending overall survival. The re-expression of PTHrP in lowly cachectic models is sufficient to induce wasting and reduce survival in mice, which is reversed by the conditional deletion of the PTHrP receptor, Pth1r, in adipocytes. Mechanistically, tumor-derived PTHrP suppresses de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes, leading to a molecular rewiring of adipose depots to promote wasting in the cachectic state. Finally, the pharmacological disruption of the PTHrP-PTH1R signaling axis abrogates wasting, highlighting that a targeted disruption of tumor-adipose crosstalk is an effective means to limit cachexia.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the prototypical cancer type associated with cancer cachexia, a debilitating wasting syndrome marked by adipose tissue loss and muscle atrophy. Herein, we establish that PTHrP is a tumor-derived factor that facilitates cachexia by downregulating de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes and that blocking PTHrP is an effective means to limit wasting in preclinical mouse models.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients.

Using longitudinal data collected at baseline and Year 2 from 2,949 individuals (ages 8.9-13.5) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we show that baseline resting-state functional connectivity (FC) more strongly predicts future cognitive ability than concurrent cognitive ability. Models trained on baseline FC to predict baseline cognition generalize better to Year 2 data, suggesting that brain-cognition relationships strengthen over time. Intriguingly, baseline FC outperforms longitudinal FC change in predicting future cognitive ability. Differences in measurement reliability do not fully explain this discrepancy: although FC change is less reliable (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.24) than baseline FC (ICC = 0.56), matching baseline FC reliability by shortening scan time only partially narrows the predictive gap. Furthermore, neither baseline FC nor FC change meaningfully predicts longitudinal change in cognitive ability. We also identify converging and diverging predictive network features across cross-sectional and longitudinal models of brain-cognition relationships, revealing a multivariate twist on Simpsons paradox. Together, these findings suggest that during early adolescence, stable individual differences in brain functional network organization exert a stronger influence on future cognitive outcomes than short-term changes.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

We introduce GeneChat, a multi-modal large language model designed to generate free-form, natural language descriptions of gene functions directly from nucleotide sequences and textual prompts. GeneChat integrates three components: a DNABERT-2-based gene encoder optimized for long-range genomic context, an adaptor that aligns gene representations with the input space of a large language model, and Vicuna-13B, a fine-tuned LLaMA-2 variant used to produce coherent functional narratives. Trained on over 50,000 genes from the NCBI database, GeneChat outperforms GPT-4o on BLEU and METEOR metrics, demonstrating superior ability to generate accurate, context-aware, and semantically rich descriptions. This work highlights the potential of foundation models for advancing interpretable and scalable gene function prediction in a free-form, language-driven paradigm.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

As LLMs now demonstrate expert-level diagnostic performance, the focus shifts from whether AI can offer valuable suggestions to how it can be effectively integrated into physicians diagnostic workflows. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=70 clinicians) to evaluate the value of employing a custom GPT system designed to engage collaboratively with clinicians on diagnostic reasoning challenges. The collaborative design began with independent diagnostic assessments from both the clinician and the AI. These were then combined in an AI-generated synthesis that integrated the two perspectives, highlighting points of agreement and disagreement and offering commentary on each. We evaluated two workflow variants: one where the AI provided an initial opinion (AI-first), and another where it followed the clinicians assessment (AI-second). Clinicians using either collaborative workflow outperformed those using traditional tools, achieving average accuracies of 85% (AI-first) and 82% (AI-second), compared to 75% with traditional resources (p < 0.0004 and p < 0.00001; mean differences = 9.8% and 6.8%; 95% CI = 4.6%-15% and 4.0%-9.6%).

TDP-43 is a nucleic acid-binding protein involved in transcriptional repression, mRNA splicing, and the regulation of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). RTEs and ERVs are mobile genetic elements that constitute about 45% of our genome. These virus-like elements encode the capacity to replicate through an RNA intermediate and insert cDNA copies at de novo chromosomal locations. Their expression is a proven source of DNA damage and inflammatory signaling. Research in Drosophila has demonstrated a causal role of RTEs/ERVs in mediating both intracellular toxicity of TDP-43 and the intercellular spread of these toxic effects from glia to neurons. RTEs and ERVs are inappropriately expressed in postmortem tissues from ALS, FTD, and Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients, as well as in cell culture in response to TDP-43 disruption, suggesting that the findings in Drosophila may be conserved across species. But the role of RTEs and ERVs has not yet been examined in a vertebrate model of TDP-43 pathology. To investigate the functional contributions of RTEs in vertebrates, we utilized an established transgenic mouse model that overexpresses moderate levels of either human wild-type TDP-43 (hTDP-43-WT) or a mutant version with a specific causal amino acid substitution (hTDP-43-Q331K) associated with some inherited forms of the disease. Through RNA-sequencing of the motor cortex, and imaging of a LINE-1-EGFP retrotransposon indicator cassette, we found that the TDP-43 transgenic animals exhibit broad expression of RTEs and ERVs, along with replication of LINE-1 in glia and neurons in the motor cortex. This expression begins at the age of onset of neurological phenotypes, earlier in the hTDP-43-Q331K animals and much later in hTDP-43-WT. Although the motor defects progressively worsen over time, the LINE-1-EGFP replication reporter transiently labels spatially clustered groups of neurons and glia at the time of onset of motor symptoms. These EGFP-labeled neurons undergo cell death and are therefore lost over time. Unlabeled cells also die as a function of distance from the clusters of LINE-1-EGFP labeled neurons and glial cells. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that TDP-43 pathology triggers RTE/ERV expression in the motor cortex, that such expression marks cells for programmed cell death, with non-cell autonomous effects on nearby neurons and glial cells.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

However, how distinct -synuclein strains are formed in vivo remains unknown. Here, we examined whether unique strains of self-propagating -synuclein aggregates can arise within a consistent molecular environment. Unexpectedly, we observed conformational heterogeneity between individual preparations of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) generated by polymerizing recombinant wild-type or A53T-mutant human -synuclein under identical conditions. Moreover, we found that -synuclein aggregates formed spontaneously in the brains of a transgenic synucleinopathy mouse model were conformationally diverse, leading to the identification of three distinct disease subtypes. Propagation of putative PFF- and brain-derived -synuclein strains in mice initiated several distinct synucleinopathies, characterized by differences in disease onset times, cerebral -synuclein deposition patterns, and the conformational attributes of -synuclein aggregates. The conformational diversity of -synuclein aggregates across PFF preparations and between the brains of individual transgenic mice demonstrates that -synuclein can spontaneously form multiple self-propagating strains within an identical environment both in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that stochastic misfolding into distinct aggregate structures drives the emergence of -synuclein strains and implies that the intrinsic variability of common synucleinopathy research tools must be considered when designing and interpreting experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

Here, we uncover that the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the colon undergoes a lasting pathological reprogramming following inflammation, forming a remodeled niche - modECM - that persistently disrupts intestinal stem cell (ISC) identity. Using temporal multi-omics, biomechanical profiling, and spatial fate mapping in murine colitis models, we show that modECM, characterized by Collagen XVIII accumulation and immune-driven proteolysis, redirects ISCs toward a wound-associated, squamous-like epithelial state with pro-inflammatory transcriptional signatures. Ex vivo, modECM alone reprograms ISC fate by suppressing Wnt signaling and activating immune recruitment pathways. In vivo, modECM-rich zones sustain T cell infiltration and KRT14 epithelial cell emergence from Lgr5 progenitors. This aberrant epithelial program is mirrored in inflamed rectal biopsies from ulcerative colitis patients. Our findings redefine the ECM as a long-lived instructive compartment that encodes injury memory and promotes maladaptive regeneration, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory disease.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

Mutations and certain post-translational modifications impact its aggregation propensity and pathogenicity. Glycation, a non-enzymatic modification enhanced during hyperglycemia and aging, both known risk factors for PD, has been implicated in -Syn pathology. Although preformed -Syn-fibrils induce PD-like phenotypes in mice, the impact of glycation on their pathogenicity is unclear. In the current study, we glycated -Syn using methylglyoxal (MGO), a potent glycating agent, resulting in altered biophysical characteristics in comparison to non-glycated -Syn. Glycation inhibited the formation of typical beta sheet structures under aggregating conditions. Despite that, glycated -Syn assemblies induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation to a similar extent as the non-glycated -Syn fibrils upon their injection in the mouse substantia nigra (SN). However, these glycated assemblies triggered higher neuroinflammation and increased accumulation of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) compared to non-glycated fibrils. Consequently, an earlier onset of neuromuscular deficits and anxiety was observed in these mice. Thus, glycation of -Syn causes distinct PD-associated pathology compared to non-glycated -Syn, causing an earlier onset of motor symptoms. These findings provide insight into how glycation of -Syn due to hyperglycemia may contribute to an increased risk of PD in diabetic populations.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

While there have been thousands of host-pathogen PPIs determined to date, the lack of structural information for these impedes the study of the prevalence of molecular mimicry and convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. To address this, we benchmarked AlphaFold2 and 3 for prediction of structures of host-pathogen interactions observing that accurate models can be retrieved when ranking by modelling confidence, despite an overall low performance. We predicted structures for 6,782 pathogen-human PPIs yielding 803 models of higher confidence. Most pathogen proteins interacting with a common human protein are predicted to do so via the same interface, suggesting a high degree of convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. When comparing structural models from host-pathogen and host-host interactions, we observe that a majority of pathogen proteins are predicted to target existing human PPI interfaces. We categorized instances of mimicry into different modes, occurring at different frequencies: 1) via the same domain family (least common); 2) via a similar structural motif; and 3) via a similar linear motif (most common). We selected examples of linear motif interactions for binding assay testing, confirming 8 out of 12 predicted interfaces, including 3 viral linear motif interactions. This validates AlphaFolds ability to model some host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry. This work showcases the value of large-scale structural modelling to study convergent evolution of host-pathogen interactions and how molecular mimicry may contribute to infection or host defense.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357929

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Some antibiotics have the potential to mediate interference competition by triggering a bacterial stress response that subsequently activates endogenous viruses integrated in bacterial genomes (prophages). Canonically, this activation is regulated by the SOS response upon DNA damage. Here we show that a metabolite produced by natural isolates of Vibrio ordalii circumvents the SOS response by directly triggering prophage induction in other Vibrio species, co-occurring in the same environment. While the metabolite was previously classified as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, we observe how it acts as a peptide deformylase inhibitor that specifically induces certain prophages, even when target bacterial cells carry multiple other prophages. Its biosynthetic gene cluster, or ord cluster, also encodes its own peptide deformylase (OrdE) which provides self-immunity to producer strains. Likewise, among natural Vibrio isolates that carry similar prophages, resistance against the ord metabolite was found in those that had acquired a divergent second peptide deformylase. Finally, we show that prophage induction by the ord cluster prevents slower-growing producer strains from being outcompeted by their otherwise fast-growing competitors if they carry an inducible prophage. Thus, we demonstrate how natural products play additional impactful roles in communities beyond antibiotic activity and that prophage induction serves as an interference competition strategy, sustaining community diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1749593357930

They are characterized by extensive genetic heterogeneity, possibly the highest among all human genetic diseases, as well as diverse inheritance patterns. Despite advances in gene discovery, limited understanding of gene function and challenges in accurately interpreting variants continue to hinder both molecular diagnosis and genetic research in IRDs. One key problem is the absence of a comprehensive and widely accepted catalogue of disease genes, which would ensure consistent genetic testing and reliable molecular diagnoses. With the rapid pace of IRD gene discovery, gene catalogues require frequent validation and updates to remain clinically and scientifically useful.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1749593357930

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1749593357930

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
