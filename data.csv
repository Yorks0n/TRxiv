Neurological symptoms include anxiety, depression and impaired short-term memory. However, the exact underlying mechanisms of long Covid are not yet decrypted. Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid. Conclusively, we provide evidence that virus-related and neurodegenerative and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of infected hamsters and contribute to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of California's state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole. We urge high-quality medical care for prison residents affected by long COVID, and decarceration to reduce the risk of future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1734559712448

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3' region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

We identify communities at multiple resolutions, departing from typological models of analysis and interpretation that categorize individuals into a (predefined) number of sets. We applied our pipeline to a dataset merged from the 1000 Genomes and Human Genome Diversity Project5, revealing the limitations of traditional groupings and capturing the complexities introduced by demographic events and evolutionary processes. This method embraces the context-specificity of genetic similarities that are salient depending on the question, markers of interest, and study individuals. Different numbers of communities are revealed depending on the resolution chosen and metric used, underscoring a fluid spectrum of genetic relationships and challenging the notion of universal categorization.

The whooping crane (Grus americana) experienced severe population declines in the 18th century, culminating into a collapse to 16 individuals in 1941. Legal protections and conservation actions have since increased the population to approximately 840 individuals, yet the impact on genomic diversity remains unclear. We analysed the temporal dynamics of genomic erosion by sequencing a high-quality genome reference, and re-sequencing 16 historical and 37 modern genomes, including wild individuals and four generations of captive-bred individuals. Genomic demographic reconstructions reveal a steady decline, accelerating over the past 300 years with the European settlement of North America. Temporal genomic analyses show that despite demographic recovery, the species has lost 70% of its genetic diversity and has increased their inbreeding. Although the modern population bottleneck reduced the ancestral genetic load, modern populations possess more realized load than masked load, possibly resulting in a chronic loss of fitness. Integrating pedigree and genomic data, we underscore the role of breeding management in reducing recent inbreeding. Yet ongoing heterozygosity loss, load accumulation, and background inbreeding argues against the species' downlisting from their current Endangered status on the IUCN Red List and the Endangered Species Act. The presence of private genetic variation in wild and captive populations suggests that wild-captive crosses could enhance genetic diversity and reduce the realized load.

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1734559712448

However, most existing genetic studies have been based on short-read sequencing methods, which capture fewer than half of the SVs present in any one individual. Long-read sequencing (LRS) enhances our ability to detect disease-associated and functionally relevant structural variants (SVs); however, its application in large-scale genomic studies has been limited by challenges in sample preparation and high costs. Here, we leverage a new scalable wet-lab protocol and computational pipeline for whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing and apply it to neurologically normal control samples from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) (European ancestry) and Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) (African or African admixed ancestry) cohorts. Through this work, we present a publicly available long-read resource from 351 human brain samples (median N50: 27 Kbp and at an average depth of ~40x genome coverage). We discover approximately 234,905 SVs and produce locally phased assemblies that cover 95% of all protein-coding genes in GRCh38. Utilizing matched expression datasets for these samples, we apply quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses and identify SVs that impact gene expression in post-mortem frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we determine haplotype-specific methylation signatures at millions of CpGs and, with this data, identify cis-acting SVs. In summary, these results highlight that large-scale LRS can identify complex regulatory mechanisms in the brain that were inaccessible using previous approaches. We believe this new resource provides a critical step toward understanding the biological effects of genetic variation in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

However, size affects the dynamics, and, outside a range of robust morphogenesis, the precision of anterior-posterior (AP) axial elongation. Gastruloid axial elongation exhibits active cellular contractility, requires planar cell polarity (PCP), adhesion and cell-cell contact remodelling. Smaller gastruloids initiate elongation earlier, correlated with an earlier Brachyury polarisation. Brachyury expression increases tissue fluidity. Axis formation is regulated by the balance of Brachyury multifoci coalescence and the timing of initiation of the elongation programme. Sizes beyond the robust range can modify relative tissue composition.

We present evidence that influenza viruses, alphaviruses, and some mononegaviruses emerged prior to the evolution of vertebrates. We also show that the recombination of glycoproteins between different orders of RNA viruses, including between positive- and negative-sense viruses, may have shaped the evolution of multiple lineages.

One of the features of embryo models is their multilineage differentiation, which allows the co-development of, and interactions between, tissues. Here, we utilise a human Trunk-like Structure (hTLS) model to explore trunk development. We show that hTLS have morphologically organised somites and a neural tube that form through self-organised, endogenous signalling including anteroposterior FGF, Wnt and Retinoic Acid (RA) gradients that modulate the fate of neuromesodermal progenitors. Comparison to an existing dataset from organogenesis-stage human embryos shows that hTLS cells approximate Carnegie Stage 13-14 (28-35 days post-fertilisation). The absence of a notochord leads to a dorsal identity, but exogenous exposure to smoothened agonist (promoting Sonic Hedgehog signalling) progressively ventralises both somites and neural tube in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identify endogenous signalling from the neural tube to the somites, which leads to medially localised ALDH1A2, and subsequent RA signalling from the somites to the neural tube, which leads to spontaneous neural progenitor patterning and PAX6 expression. Together, our data highlight the value of modularity in embryo models which we leverage to explore human trunk co-development.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

Particular interest lies in studying stone tool use by non-human primates, especially when stone hammers are used to open encased food sources. Percussive tool use is a rare and complex technological behavior which was also employed by our early hominin ancestors. It is widely theorized that environmental factors play a role in explaining the presence and absence of stone tool use across primate populations. Research to date has focused heavily on the quality and availability of tool-extractable foods, and how these compare to alternative food sources. There has been limited investigation into whether access to different types of raw tool material for hammerstones and anvils affects the efficiency of tool users when exploiting encased resources. Here, we quantitatively analyzed how percussive tools of different raw materials vary in their performance and durability. Wild capuchins (Sapajus libidinosus) in Brazil were provided with stones sourced globally from primate and hominin tool use sites. We measured the reliability with which monkeys could crack nuts when using different raw materials, the number of strikes required to open a nut or obtain a food reward, and how these metrics changed over time. We further reported variations in the durability of different raw materials which directly relates to how long a tool remains usable. Our results showed that differences in nut cracking reliability and efficiency were largely driven by the ability of the tool material to stabilize the nut. Furthermore, there was wide variation in tool durability, particularly for anvils. These results highlight the importance of considering raw materials among the ecological factors that can influence the selective benefits or costs of tool use behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

Recent improvements in structure prediction of protein complexes based on AlphaFold have made it possible to model heterodimeric complexes with very high accuracy. However, it is not known how this translates to host-pathogen interactions which share a different evolutionary relationship. Here, we analyse the structural protein-protein interaction network between ten different pathogens and their human host.

However, whether and to what degree L1 activity directly impacts genome integrity is unclear. Here, we apply whole-genome sequencing to experimental models of L1 expression to comprehensively define the spectrum of genomic changes caused by L1. We provide definitive evidence that L1 expression frequently and directly causes both local and long-range chromosomal rearrangements, small and large segmental copy-number alterations, and subclonal copy-number heterogeneity due to ongoing chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, all these alterations arise from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by L1-encoded ORF2p. The processing of ORF2p-generated DSB ends prior to their ligation can produce diverse rearrangements of the target sequences. Ligation between DSB ends generated at distal loci can generate either stable chromosomes or unstable dicentric, acentric, or ring chromosomes that undergo subsequent evolution through breakage-fusion bridge cycles or DNA fragmentation. Together, these findings suggest L1 is a potent mutagenic force capable of driving genome evolution beyond simple insertions.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

How this movement synchronization is achieved by the nervous system remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover the neural basis of body part coordination during goal-directed antennal grooming in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that unilateral or bilateral grooming of one or both antenna, respectively, arises from synchronized movements of the head, antennae, and forelegs. Simulated replay of these body part kinematics in a biomechanical model shows that this coordination makes grooming more efficient by permitting unobstructed, forceful collisions between the foreleg tibiae and antennae. Movements of one body part do not require proprioceptive sensory feedback from the others: neither amputation of the forelegs or antennae, nor immobilization of the head prevented movements of the other unperturbed body parts. By constructing a comprehensive antennal grooming network from the fly brain connectome, we find that centralized interneurons and shared premotor neurons interconnect and thus likely synchronize neck, antennal, and foreleg motor networks. A simulated activation screen of neurons in this network reveals cell classes required for the coordination of antennal movements during unilateral grooming. These cells form two coupled circuit motifs that enable robust body part synchronization: a recurrent excitatory subnetwork that promotes contralateral antennal pitch and broadcast inhibition that suppresses ipsilateral antennal pitch. Similarly centralized controllers may enable the flexible co-recruitment of multiple body parts to subserve a variety of behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

Here we report on recordings of dopamine-dependent fluorescence using a high-sensitivity dopamine indicator. We deliver an array of rewarding, aversive and mixed valence stimuli, as well as stimuli without any obvious valence. We observe that stimuli without valence, as well as the omission of expected stimuli, do not lead to large changes in fluorescence, even when these stimuli and omissions are both novel and engaging. In contrast, both rewarding and aversive stimuli lead to increases in fluorescence, with the most rewarding and most aversive stimuli leading to the largest increases. We test the effect of adding an aversive component to a rewarding stimulus and find that the increases in fluorescence are consistent with a summation of the rewarding and aversive components.

For instance, at ~$1.5-3.3k USD, current NA fluorometers present a greater capital cost than ONT's $1k USD portable MinION third-generation Nanopore sequencing platform. The collapse of international scientific device and consumable supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the need for distributed manufacturing of molecular research tools to mitigate the impact of increased pricing to RLSs.

The DIYNAFLUOR was primarily designed to be compatible with the popular DNA-centric Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) and Broad Range (BR) assay kits. Notably, the DIYNAFLUOR demonstrated an 'in-assay' Limit of Detection with the Qubit HS kit of 0.0028 ng/uL, and an average absolute bias of 0.018 ng/muL across a 0-10 ng/uL working range using a 2-point linear calibration methodology. Device verification was performed by comparative measurements with a Qubit 4 fluorometer in a busy biotechnology laboratory, and build instructions were validated through assembly and qualification of three DIYNAFLUOR devices by researchers outside the primary design team. We also describe a custom ""extreme"" low-cost assay, < 13 cent USD per-measurement, that uses SYBR Safe dye to quantify DNA across a working range of 0-0.5 ng/uL. This assay reports a lower sensitivity and accuracy than commercial kits but may be of use to RLSs in times of extreme resource constraints or as a teaching tool for STEM educators. To demonstrate its practical application for field-based eDNA analysis in RLSs, the DIYNAFLUOR was used to perform all quality control measurements throughout the preparation of a 16S and 18S metabarcoding library generated from eDNA extracted from Australian lake water, leading to the successful identification of Australian fauna via Nanopore sequencing.

Notably, disease relapse observed during long-term degrader treatment stems from proteolysis machinery dysregulation, indicating resistance mechanisms distinct from those reported upon KRAS inhibition. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of KRAS degradation in LUAD, offering insights into cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms driving durable antitumor responses and supporting further clinical exploration.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

Here, we investigated how our internal focus is reestablished following an interrupting task by tracking the reselection of visual representations and their associated action plans in working memory. Specifically, we ask whether reselection occurs for both visual and motor memory attributes and when this reselection occurs. We developed a visual-motor working-memory task in which participants were retrospectively cued to select one of two memory items before being interrupted by a perceptual discrimination task. To determine when internal representations were reselected, the interrupting task was presented at one of three distinct time points following the retro-cue. To determine what information was reselected, the memory items had distinct visual and motor attributes. We employed electroencephalography time-frequency analyses to track the initial selection and later reselection of visual and motor representations, as operationalized through modulations of posterior alpha (8-12 Hz) activity relative to the memorized item location (visual) and of central beta (13-30 Hz) activity relative to the required response hand (motor). Our results showed that internal visual and motor contents were concurrently reselected immediately after completing the interrupting task, rather than only when internal information was required for memory-guided behavior. Thus, following interruption, we swiftly resume our internal focus in working memory through the simultaneous reselection of memorized visual representations and their associated action plans, thereby restoring internal contents to a ready-to-use state.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

Small-molecule GLP1RAs promise oral bioavailability and scalable manufacturing, but their selective binding to human versus rodent receptors has limited mechanistic studies. The neural circuits through which these emerging therapeutics modulate feeding behavior remain undefined, particularly in comparison to established peptide-based GLP1RAs. Here, we developed humanized GLP1R mouse models to investigate how small-molecule GLP1RAs influence feeding behavior. Integrating genetic manipulations, calcium imaging, and behavior profiling, we discovered that these compounds regulate both homeostatic and hedonic feeding through parallel neural circuits. Beyond engaging canonical hypothalamic and hindbrain networks that control metabolic homeostasis, GLP1RAs recruit a discrete population of Glp1r-expressing neurons in the central amygdala, which selectively suppress the consumption of palatable foods by reducing dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Stimulating these central amygdalar neurons curtail hedonic feeding, whereas targeted deletion of the receptor in this cell population specifically diminishes the anorectic efficacy of GLP1RAs for reward-driven intake. These findings reveal a dedicated neural circuit through which small molecule GLP1RAs modulate reward processing, suggesting broad therapeutic potential in conditions of dysregulated dopamine signaling including substance use disorder and binge eating.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

The response changes induced by adaptation have been characterized in detail in individual neurons and at the population level after averaging across trials. However, it is not clear how adaptation modifies the aspects of the representations that relate more directly to the ability to perceive stimuli, such as their geometry and the noise structure in individual trials. To address this question, we recorded from a population of neurons in the mouse visual cortex and presented one stimulus (an oriented grating) more frequently than the others. We then analyzed these data in terms of representational geometry and studied the ability of a linear decoder to discriminate between similar visual stimuli based on the single-trial population responses. Surprisingly, the discriminability of stimuli near the adaptor increased, even though the responses of individual neurons to these stimuli decreased. Similar changes were observed in artificial neural networks trained to reconstruct the visual stimulus under metabolic constraints. We conclude that the paradoxical effects of adaptation are consistent with the efficient coding framework, allowing the brain to improve the representation of frequent stimuli while limiting the associated metabolic cost.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

In Stage 1 of the project, a list of potential trustworthiness checks was created. The checks on this list must be evaluated to determine which should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

MethodsWe attempted to apply 72 trustworthiness checks to RCTs in 50 Cochrane Reviews. For each, we recorded whether the check was passed, failed or possibly failed, or whether it was not feasible to complete the check. Following application of the checks, we recorded whether we had concerns about the authenticity of each RCT. We repeated each meta-analysis after removing RCTs flagged by each check, and again after removing RCTs where we had concerns about authenticity, to estimate the impact of trustworthiness assessment. Trustworthiness assessments were compared to Risk of Bias and GRADE assessments in the reviews.

Results95 RCTs were assessed. Following application of the checks, assessors had some or serious concerns about the authenticity of 25% and 6% of the RCTs, respectively. Removing RCTs with either some or serious concerns resulted in 22% of meta-analyses having no remaining RCTs. However, many checks proved difficult to understand or implement, which may have led to unwarranted scepticism in some instances. Furthermore, we restricted assessment to meta-analyses with no more than 5 RCTs, which will distort the impact on results. No relationship was identified between trustworthiness assessment and Risk of Bias or GRADE.

ConclusionsThis study supports the case for routine trustworthiness assessment in systematic reviews, as problematic studies do not appear to be flagged by Risk of Bias assessment. The study produced evidence on the feasibility and impact of trustworthiness checks. These results will be used, in conjunction with those from a subsequent Delphi process, to determine which checks should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

Plain language summarySystematic reviews collate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to find out whether health interventions are safe and effective. However, it is now recognised that the findings of some RCTs are not genuine, and some of these studies appear to have been fabricated. Various checks for these ""problematic"" RCTs have been proposed, but it is necessary to evaluate these checks to find out which are useful and which are feasible. We applied a comprehensive list of ""trustworthiness checks"" to 95 RCTs in 50 systematic reviews to learn more about them, and to see how often performing the checks would lead us to classify RCTs as being potentially inauthentic. We found that applying the checks led to concerns about the authenticity of around 1 in 3 RCTs. However, we found that many of the checks were difficult to perform and could have been misinterpreted. This might have led us to be overly sceptical in some cases. The findings from this study will be used, alongside other evidence, to decide which of these checks should be performed routinely to try to identify problematic RCTs, to stop them from being mistaken for genuine studies and potentially being used to inform healthcare decisions.

However, effectively controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains a major challenge. Here, we show that Evo, a 7-billion parameter genomic language model, can perform function-guided design that generalizes beyond natural sequences. By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic ""autocomplete"" in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions. We term this process ""semantic mining,"" which, unlike traditional genome mining, can access a sequence landscape unconstrained by discovered evolutionary innovation. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions.

When case-control GWAS are conducted, researchers must make decisions regarding how many cases and how many controls to include in the study. Depending on differing availability and cost of controls and cases, varying case fractions are used in case-control GWAS. Connections between variants and diseases are made using association statistics, including {chi}2. Previous work in population genetics has shown that LD statistics, including r2, are bounded by the allele frequencies in the population being studied. Since varying the case fraction changes sample allele frequencies, we extend use the known bounds on r2 to explore how variation in the fraction of cases included in a study can impact statistical power to detect associations. We analyze a simple mathematical model and use simulations to study a quantity proportional to the {chi}2 noncentrality parameter, which is closely related to r2, under various conditions. Varying the case fraction changes the {chi}2 noncentrality parameter, and by extension the statistical power, with effects depending on the dominance, penetrance, and frequency of the risk allele. Our framework explains previously observed results, such as asymmetries in power to detect risk vs. protective alleles, and the fact that a balanced sample of cases and controls does not always give the best power to detect associations, particularly for highly penetrant minor risk alleles that are either dominant or recessive. We show by simulation that our results can be used as a rough guide to statistical power for association tests other than {chi}2 tests of independence.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

This use of a few model systems is reasonable if major features of the immune systems evolve slowly and are conserved across most vertebrates, but may be problematic if there is substantial macroevolutionary change in immune responses. Here, we present a test of the macroevolutionary stability, across 15 species of jawed fishes, of the transcriptomic response to a standardized immune challenge. Intraperitoneal injection of an immune adjuvant (alum) induces a fibrosis response in nearly all jawed fishes, which in some species contributes to anti-helminth resistance. Despite this conserved phenotypic response, the underlying transcriptomic response is highly inconsistent across species. Although many gene orthogroups exhibit differential expression between saline versus alum-injected fish in at least one species, few orthogroups exhibit consistent differential expression across species. This result suggests that although the phenotypic response to alum (fibrosis) is highly conserved, the underlying gene regulatory architecture is very flexible and cannot readily be extrapolated from any one species to fishes (or vertebrates) more broadly. The vertebrate immune response is remarkably changeable over macroevolutionary time, requiring a diversity of model organisms to describe effectively.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

These processes rely on the precise coordination of intricate multicellular interactions across time and space. How aging disrupts these interactions, leading to the overall decline in reproductive and endocrine functions, remains understudied. To understand the multicellular dynamics that underlie ovarian function and their changes with age, here we use Slide-seq, a near-cellular spatial transcriptomics method, to profile 21 ovaries across reproductive cycles and chronological age, representing 601,831 near-cellular spots across 68 spatial transcriptomic profiles. We develop a segmentation analysis to identify static snapshots of spatial niches that capture folliculogenesis in situ, allowing us to examine the multicellular dynamics of 345 oocytes, 653 follicles, and 234 corpora lutea. We find that aging disrupts both the spatial organization and temporal coordination of folliculogenesis before the cessation of cycling, leading to dysregulation of hormone production and signaling. These disruptions are marked by altered immune cell dynamics, inflammatory signaling, and global tissue disorganization that impair the cyclic remodeling required for ovarian function. Our findings reveal how multicellular niches orchestrate the reproductive and endocrine functions of the ovary and demonstrate how age-related breakdown of tissue organization across time and space precedes reproductive decline.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

Here, we reveal that eosinophils actively shape the tumor microenvironment and influence metastatic progression. Using comprehensive transcriptomics analysis of human CRC and a murine orthotopic tumor model, we identify a conserved tumor-specific eosinophil signature and activation profile. Despite their declining presence in advanced CRC, eosinophils suppress metastatic dissemination by counteracting the pro-tumorigenic functions of SPP1+ macrophages - a subset linked to immune exclusion and tumor metastasis. Mechanistically, eosinophils respond to tumor-derived signals and inhibit macrophage differentiation into SPP1+ cells. Eosinophil depletion exacerbates peritoneal tumor spread. These findings highlight the pivotal role of eosinophils in restraining late-stage CRC progression and unveil a novel eosinophil-macrophage axis as potential therapeutic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

Methods We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed studies that leveraged CSVD features for ML-based diagnosis and/or prognosis of cognitive impairment and dementia. Results We identified 75 relevant studies: 43 on diagnosis, 27 on prognosis, and 5 on both. CSVD markers are becoming important in ML-based classifications of neurodegenerative diseases, mainly Alzheimer's dementia, with nearly 60% of studies published in the last two years. Regression and support vector machine techniques were more common than other approaches such as ensemble and deep-learning algorithms. ML-based classification performed well for both Alzheimer's dementia (AUC 0.88 [95%-CI 0.85-0.92]) and cognitive impairment (AUC 0.84 [95%-CI 0.74-0.95]). Of 75 studies, only 16 were suitable for meta-analysis, only 11 used multiple datasets for training and validation, and six lacked clear definitions of diagnostic criteria. Discussion ML-based models using CSVD neuroimaging markers perform well in classifying cognitive impairment and dementia. However, challenges in inconsistent reporting, limited generalisability, and potential biases hinder adoption. Our targeted recommendations provide a roadmap to accelerate the integration of ML into clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1734559712448

In Trypanosoma brucei, IFT trains predominantly associate with four of the nine DMTs. Using high-resolution microscopy, we reveal how this selective association is put in place. IFT proteins form a ring surrounding the 9 DMTs on top of the transition fibres. Volume electron microscopy revealed densities along all DMTs in the proximal portion of the flagellum, exhibiting thinner, shorter profiles with branches absent in mature IFT trains. As the axoneme extends within the flagellar pocket, IFT trains are detected but are often positioned outside DMTs 3-4/7-8. After the axoneme exits the flagellar pocket, IFT trains localise exclusively to DMTs 3-4 and 7-8. Super-resolution and expansion microscopy demonstrated that IFT proteins follow the same distribution as the IFT-like densities. This suggests they represent IFT trains undergoing assembly and/or disassembly and reveals their unexpected ability to shift from one DMT to another.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

However, almost no research has included environmental factors spanning micro-to-macro-systems, brain structure, and psychopathology in an integrated framework. Here, we assessed the ways and degree to which multi-system environmental factors during late childhood predict subcortical volume and psychopathology during early adolescence. Method: We used the baseline and 2-year follow-up data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (N = 2,766). A Bayesian latent profile analysis was applied to obtain distinct multi-system environmental profiles during late childhood. The profiles were used in a path analysis to predict their direct and indirect effects on subcortical volume and psychopathology during early adolescence. Results: Bayesian latent profile analysis revealed nine environmental profiles. Two distinct profiles predicted greater externalizing problems in adolescents: (i) adversity across, family, school, and neighborhood systems and (ii) family conflict and low school involvement. In contrast, a profile of family and neighborhood affluence predicted fewer externalizing difficulties. Further, family and neighborhood affluence predicted higher subcortical volume, which in turn, predicted fewer externalizing problems; whereas, family economic and neighborhood adversity predicted lower subcortical volume, which in turn, predicted greater externalizing difficulties. Conclusion: We captured direct and indirect influences of environmental factors across multiple systems on externalizing psychopathology. Specifying the equifinal pathways to externalizing psychopathology serves to provide an evidence base for establishing different types of interventions based on the needs and risk profiles of youth.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

Symptoms are marked by persistent lower back pain, reduced mobility, and heightened cold sensitivity. Here, we utilize a mouse model of CBP induced by injecting urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a proinflammatory agent in the fibrinolytic pathway, between the L2/L3 lumbar vertebrae. We identified neuroimmune interactions contributing to uPA-induced CBP (henceforth, uPA-CBP) in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where nociceptive neurons reside. Flow cytometric data reveal that uPA-CBP increases CD45+CD11b+ cells in the DRG, a population characteristically implicated in other chronic pain models. Blocking colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling using PLX5622 partially reduced pain, suggesting CD45+CD11b+ macrophage involvement. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology data indicated DRG neuron hyperexcitability in CBP mice compared to controls.

There is a pressing need for tools that allow automated analysis of convergent mutations. In response to this need, we developed ConvMut, a tool for identifying patterns of recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. To this end, we exploited the granular phylogenetic tree representation developed by PANGO, allowing us to observe what we call deltas, i.e., groups of mutations that are acquired on top of the immediately upstream tree nodes. Deltas comprise both amino acid substitutions and deletions. ConvMut can perform individual protein analysis to identify the most common single mutations acquired independently in a given subtree (starting from a user-selected root). Such mutations are represented in a barplot that can be sorted by frequency or position and filtered by region of interest. Lineages are then gathered into clusters according to their sets of shared mutations. Finally, an interactive graph orders the clusters, details the acquired amino acid changes for each sublineage, and allows us to the evolutive path until a selected lineage. Other unique tools are paired with the main functionality of ConvMut to support a complete analysis, such as a frequency analysis for a given nucleotide or amino acid changes at a given residue across a selected phylogenetic subtree. We expect that ConvMut will facilitate the design of antiviral anti-Spike monoclonal antibodies and Spike-based vaccines with longer-lasting efficacy, minimizing development and marketing failures.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

By screening 10 million eukaryotic proteins, we identified several domains that define multi-copy gene families and frequently co-occur with TE/viral domains. Among these, a Tc1/Mariner transposase helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain was captured by F-box genes in the Caenorhabditis genus, creating a new class of F-box genes. For specific members of this class, like fbxa-215, we found that the HTH domain is required for diverse processes including germ granule localisation, fertility, and thermotolerance. Furthermore, we provide evidence that HSF-1 mediates the transcriptional integration of fbxa-215 into the heat-shock response by binding to Helitron TEs directly upstream of the fbxa-215 locus. The interactome of HTH-bearing F-box factors suggests roles in post translational regulation and proteostasis, consistent with established functions of F-box proteins. Based on AlphaFold2 multimer proteome-wide screens, we propose that the HTH domain may diversify the repertoire of protein substrates that F-box factors regulate post-translationally. We further demonstrate that F-box genes repeatedly and independently captured TE domains throughout eukaryotic evolution, and describe an additional instance in zebrafish. In conclusion, we identify recurrent TE domain captures by F-box genes in eukaryotes and provide insights into how these novel proteins are integrated within host gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448

We propose two main techniques to reduce the compute time, which are motivated by coalescent and recombination processes. We observe average runtimes to simulate detectable IBD segments around a locus that scale approximately linearly in sample size and take a couple of seconds for sample sizes less than ten thousand. In contrast, we find that existing methods to simulate IBD segments take minutes to hours for sample sizes exceeding a few thousand. When using IBD segments to study recent positive selection around a locus, our efficient algorithm makes feasible statistical inferences that would be otherwise intractable.","NA","biorxiv",1734559712448
