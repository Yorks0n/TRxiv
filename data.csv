MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

ObjectiveTo assess the transportability of findings from the RCT Lung-MAP S1400I to real-world populations in the United States (US), Germany and France.

DesignThis empirical validation study used patient-level data from the RCT Lung-MAP S1400I to build a transportability model to adjust for differences in patient characteristics from real-world target patient populations. Two sets of adjustments were performed - one limited to the set of measured clinical variables, and the second additionally including external information drawn from published literature and substantive knowledge on patient subgroups excluded from the trial. The latter enabled transportability to a significantly more diverse and representative real-world patient population by relaxing the stringent exclusion criteria used in Lung-MAP S1400I. For benchmarking, we compared how well the transportability analysis approximated observed overall survival in the respective real-world cohorts.

SettingObservational study.

ParticipantsEligible individuals diagnosed with advanced or metastatic NSCLC and previously treated with systemic therapy.

Intervention/exposureNivolumab monotherapy.

Main outcome measuresOverall survival.

ResultsSample size for the nivolumab arm in Lung-MAP S1400I was 127 and ranged from 133 to 1051 for the various real-world cohorts included. Patients with ECOG scores of 2+, index cancer stage <IV, presence of ALK/EGFR mutations, presence of comorbidities and prior exposure to immunotherapy/targeted therapies were excluded from Lung-MAP S1400I, were but were eligible to receive nivolumab monotherapy in real-world care. Adjusting for measured clinical differences improved alignment of patient outcomes in the RCT and the real-world cohorts. However, only when variables related to excluded patient groups were also addressed did the results fully satisfy control conditions, yielding the closest approximation to real-world survival in the US, Germany, and France (mean discrepancy: 0.27 months over [~]30 months).

ConclusionsOverall survival in a more diverse real-world patient population could be extrapolated using data from the Lung-MAP S1400I trial when complemented with external information about excluded patient groups.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

The largest previous genetic studies of intelligence have used ~270k individuals who completed the fluid intelligence (FI) tests in UK Biobank. Here, we integrate additional FI measures in this cohort and leverage 82 correlated variables to impute FI values for unmeasured individuals, increasing the sample size to >450k. Through population-based and within-family genome-wide association studies and genetic correlation analyses, we show that this imputation produces a phenotype that genetically resembles measured FI, as well as reduces ascertainment bias within the cohort. We further show that combining measured and imputed FI scores increases the number of independent SNP associations (p<5x10-8) from 385 to 608 and increases polygenic score accuracy in external cohorts by 15% on average. Additionally, incorporating imputed FI scores increases the number of gene-level associations with rare variants from five to twenty-six (FDR<1%). These include fourteen well-established developmental disorder-associated genes, a four-fold enrichment (p=8x10-8); for several of these (e.g. ATP1A1, CACNA1E), our results suggest that the gene has a loss-of-function mechanism as well as the previously-documented altered function mechanism. We also implicate twelve genes without strong prior evidence of association developmental disorders, of which eight have not been previously linked to intelligence (ROBO2, RB1CC1, ANK3, CHD9, TLK1, PCLO, DPP8, IPO9). These twelve genes were significantly enriched for de novo loss-of-function mutations in a set of >31k patients with developmental disorders (p=6.8x10-4). We further identify three genes showing significant rare variant associations with educational attainment but not with FI in UK Biobank, including CADPS2 in which, unusually, protein-truncating variants show a positive association. Our results demonstrate the power of phenotype imputation for genetic studies and suggest that incorporating genetic association results for cognitive phenotypes in the general population could help discover new developmental disorder genes.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

However, in humans, corresponding changes in dopamine-dependent behavior, such as reward learning with increasing BMI, have not been conclusively established and dissociated from pathological eating behavior. Here, we provide a principled assessment of differences in reinforcement learning (RL) related to obesity or pathological eating, such as binge eating (BE), using a large sample of 370 participants enriched for high BMI and BE. To dissociate trait and state components of RL, participants completed up to 31 runs of a novel RL game across weeks (1,486,950 observed choices). We used hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate the mean and variability of parameters for each individual. Across runs, higher BMI was predicted by higher and more variable learning rates using elastic net models ({Delta}R2=.19; pperm<.0001) although performance did not differ (r=-0.04, pboot=.46). In contrast, BE and the dimension loss of control were characterized by lower and more variable reward sensitivity ({Delta}R2=.19, controlled for BMI; pperm<.0001) leading to fewer points (r=.10, pboot=.030). Crucially, patients with BE disorder also showed attenuated reward sensitivity in the nucleus accumbens during anticipation in an effort task that required no learning (p=.006). We conclude that obesity-related differences in reward learning are best explained by changes in learning, whereas BE and loss of control were mostly driven by reduced reward sensitivity. Notably, repeated assessments revealed that increased variability across states contribute to both obesity and BE. Our findings highlight the necessity to complement neurobiological research with behavioral precision mapping to derive mechanistic insight into multidimensional disorders such as obesity and BE disorder.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

We investigated how the body and brain gather informative sensory signals from a wearable augmentation interface (a robotic digit for motor augmentation), and whether naturally-mediated feedback can support technological embodiment.

Participants intuitively interpreted natural feedback across perceptual tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art artificial feedback systems. fMRI revealed an immediate and distinct, topographically-organised representation of the robotic digit. After longitudinal training, this representation was further refined, becoming more similar to the biological digits, which correlated with increased subjective somatosensory embodiment.

Our findings demonstrate that wearable devices naturally provide a powerful source of feedback which is immediately integrated with our body. Long-term use can then promote device-embodiment across the sensorimotor hierarchy.","NA","biorxiv",1750543703076

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

While this protective niche has been described, the molecular determinants orchestrating its formation and dictating its immune interactions are not well defined. Using Perturb-map, we determine how dozens of different gene perturbations shape the growth and cellular environments of PDAC clones through space and time. Our study reveals dynamic, gene-specific adaptations of immune neighborhoods during clonal selection. We identified Serpinb2 (PAI2) and Serpine1 (PAI1) as key cancer-derived mediators of TME remodeling and immune evasion. These factors promote the deposition of a fibrin-rich ECM that shapes immune cell composition, locally retains and polarizes immunosuppressive macrophages and excludes cytotoxic T cells. Deletion of either Serpinb2 or Serpine1 greatly enhanced tumor response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in an aggressive PDAC model. Transcriptomic analysis further linked their expression to distinct PDAC subtypes and poor patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that Serpinb2 and Serpine1 establish a permissive niche for tumor progression and show how PDAC cells exploit components of the fibrinolysis pathway to remodel the ECM, alter macrophage composition, and protect themselves from immune editing, ultimately reinforcing the role of extracellular factors in shaping an immune-privileged tumor niche.","NA","biorxiv",1750543703076

Panic disorder, diagnosed in 2- 4%3, involves recurrent attacks followed by persistent worry about further attacks, leading to functional impairment and avoidance behaviours1,2. We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses of panic attacks and panic disorder (61,746 and 29,775 cases, respectively, and 105,814 controls), identifying the first genome-wide significant variants for both traits (16 for panic attacks; 7 for panic disorder). Geneset analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing data implicated afferent neurons from the eye, heart, and lung in panic attacks, suggesting a critical role for sensory processing and interoceptive awareness. Further analyses suggested that these associations generalize to other psychiatric disorders. These findings offer novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying panic, the role of afferent neurons, and may inform the development of more targeted and effective interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

Findings: In this study of ~89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors. Meaning: Avoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases. Abstract Importance: Light at night causes circadian disruption, which is a known risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individual's risk of cardiovascular diseases. Objective: To assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: United Kingdom. Participants: N=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female. Exposure: Approximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each). Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking. Results: People with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort. Conclusions and Relevance: Night light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

Typhimurium (STm) is an enteric pathogen that causes almost 100 million cases of salmonellosis a year. A hallmark of STm is their ability to survive and replicate in the macrophages that phagocytose them. Inside the Salmonella-containing vesicles (SCV) STm is exposed to nutrient limitation and antimicrobial molecules, including itaconate, a dicarboxylate produced at millimolar concentrations by activated macrophages. STm has an itaconate degradation pathway that allows it to detoxify itaconate and convert it into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. In the SCV, STm undergoes extensive metabolic reprogramming in response to the nutrient limitation and high stress environment, and strict catabolite control is employed at various stages of infection, depending on carbon source availability. The extent to which itaconate is used as a carbon source by STm is not currently well understood. Here, we explore the ability of STm to grow in media containing itaconate as the sole carbon source, identify the genes of the itaconate response operon necessary for itaconate degradation, and confirm their importance during infection of macrophages. Growth on itaconate was substantially slower than in carbon-rich or acetate media, with multiple subcultures allowing for increased growth rates. Genomic analysis suggests that mutations in the RpoS-stress response and increased expression of the DctA transporter improve growth on itaconate. Using metabolomics, it was revealed that growth on itaconate resulted in substantially reduced levels of gluconeogenesis compared to growth on acetate and increased glutathione disulfide levels, indicating a high level of oxidative stress. Overall, our results point towards the STm itaconate degradation pathway having a more important role in detoxifying itaconate, rather than using it as a carbon source inside the macrophage. Additionally, this study establishes media conditions that would enable the high throughput discovery of potential inhibitors of itaconate degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1750543703076

The utility of stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) in this subgroup, particularly the probability of delineating a single seizure onset zone (SOZ) that would permit curative resection, remains poorly understood. This study examined whether BI/U scalp EEG findings could predict SEEG outcomes in this population.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy and BI/U ictal onset on scalp EEG who underwent SEEG evaluation at the London Health Sciences Centre (Ontario, Canada) between January 2012 and December 2024. All patients had undergone non-invasive and invasive presurgical assessments. Surgical outcomes were determined using the Engel classification following at least one year of postoperative follow-up. A blinded decision validation sub-study was also performed. Blinded to actual outcomes, the team made decisions regarding SEEG and surgical interventions when patients found to have a single SEEG SOZ were presented. Responses were stratified to inform the added diagnostic value of SEEG.

Of 255 SEEG cases screened, 84 patients (33%) met inclusion criteria. The cohort was 56% female, with a median seizure onset age of 12 years (IQR 6-20); 65.5% had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). A single SOZ was identified in 14.3% of cases (TLE: 14.5%, extratemporal: 13.8%). Patients with a single SEEG SOZ were found to have shorter recording durations (mean of 11 vs 15.79 days in those with multifocal SEEG SOZs; p=0.009). Curative focal resections were performed in 12% (n=10), with long-term Engel I outcomes achieved in one patient (1.2%). Palliative resections occurred in 26% (n=22), with Engel I outcomes in 7% (n=6). In 50% of the blinded cases, the epilepsy surgery team reported that they would not have recommended SEEG based on phase I data.

These findings suggest that patients with BI/U scalp EEG SOZs may be associated with a low likelihood of identifying a single SEEG SOZ and curative outcome. Using BI/U scalp EEG ictal onset as a predictor in preoperative decision-making will assist in refining SEEG candidate selection in this large subgroup.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

Many attempts have been made to substantiate and delineate the relationship between schizophrenia and the brain through unbiased exploratory investigations of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The results of numerous data-driven rs-fMRI studies have converged in support of the disconnection hypothesis framework, reporting aberrant connectivity in cortical-subcortical-cerebellar circuitry. However, this model is vague and underspecified, encompassing a vast array of findings across studies. It is necessary to further refine this model to identify consistent patterns and establish stable imaging markers of schizophrenia and psychosis. The organizational structure of the NeuroMark atlas is especially well-equipped for describing functional units derived through independent component analysis (ICA) and uniting findings across studies utilizing data-driven whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) to characterize schizophrenia and psychosis. Towards this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted on primary empirical articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals between January 2019 - February 2025 which utilized cortical-subcortical-cerebellar terminology to describe schizophrenia-control comparisons of whole-brain FC in human rs-fMRI. The electronic databases utilized included Google scholar, PubMed, and APA PsycInfo, and search terms included (""schizophrenia"" OR ""psychosis"") AND ""resting-state fMRI"" AND (""cortical-subcortical-cerebellar"" OR ""cerebello-thalamo-cortical""). 10 studies were identified and NeuroMark nomenclature was utilized to describe findings within a common reference space. The most consistent patterns included cerebellar-thalamic hypoconnectivity, cerebellar-cortical (sensorimotor & insular-temporal) hyperconnectivity, subcortical (basal ganglia & thalamic) - cortical (sensorimotor, temporoparietal, insular-temporal, occipitotemporal, & occipital) hyperconnectivity, and cortical-cortical (insular-temporal & occipitotemporal) hypoconnectivity. Patterns implicating prefrontal cortex are largely inconsistent across studies and may not be effective targets for establishing stable imaging markers based on static FC in rs-fMRI. Instead, adapting new analytical strategies, or focusing on nodes in the cerebellum, thalamus, and primary motor and sensory cortex may prove to be a more effective approach.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

Since delay in initiation of ECT can have detrimental effects, prediction of the need for ECT could improve outcomes via more timely treatment initiation. This study aimed to predict the need for ECT following admission to a psychiatric hospital. Methods: This cohort study was based on electronic health record (EHR) data from routine clinical practice. Adult patients admitted to a hospital within the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region between January 2013 and November 2021 were included in the study. The outcome was initiation of ECT >7 days (to not include patients admitted for planned ECT) and [&le;]67 days after admission. The data was randomly split into an 85% training set and a 15% test set. On the 7th day of the inpatient stay, machine learning models (extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) were trained to predict initiation of ECT and subsequently tested on the test set, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as the main performance measure. Results: The cohort consisted of 41,610 patients with 164,961 admissions eligible for prediction. In the test set the trained model predicted ECT initiation with an AUROC of 0.94, 47% sensitivity, 98% specificity, positive predictive value of 24% and negative predictive value of 99%. The top predictors were the highest suicide assessment score and the mean Broset violence checklist score in the preceding three months.

Of particular interest, the XBB.1.5 variant has been shown to cause vaccine-breakthrough cases. Biological E (BE) has utilized the same platform it used to develop CORBEVAX, an ancestral Wuhan strain COVID-19 RBD subunit vaccine (control vaccine), to now develop an XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine (test vaccine). Methods To assess the safety and immunogenicity of BE's new XBB.1.5 subunit vaccine, a prospective, randomized, single-blind Phase III study was conducted in 5 to 80 year olds. Participants who had not received any other approved COVID-19 vaccine within the last 6 months prior were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to receive two booster doses of either the test vaccine or the control vaccine. The vaccines were administered on Day 0 and Day 28 with immunogenicity assessments on Day 0, Day 28, and Day 42. Safety assessments included the collection of solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) up until Day 56. The primary objective of the study was to show immunogenic superiority of the test vaccine booster series compared to the control vaccine series. This superiority objective was to be concluded if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the anti-XBB.1.5.RBD neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio of test : control was >1.0 on either Day 28 or Day 42. Given the emergence of JN.1 as the SARS-CoV-2 strain during the conduct of this study, Day 42 anti-JN.1 nAb were measured in a post hoc immunogenicity assessment. In addition, anti-XBB.1.5 RBD protein IgG concentration in the sera samples were also measured by ELISA on Day 0, Day 28, and Day 42. Findings A total of 360 participants were enrolled and randomized across 7 sites in India. The nAb GMT ratio of test : control participants was 2.08 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.63) on Day 28 and 2.91 (95% CI 2.38 to 3.56) on Day 42. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) was 7.637 (95% CI 6.090 to 9.578) on Day 28 and 17.02 (95% CI 13.79 to 21.01) on Day 42 in the test booster series arm. The nAb GMFRs in the control booster series arm at the same time points were 3.033 (95% CI 2.340 to 3.932) and 4.824 (95% CI 3.731 to 6.236) respectively. Post hoc analyses revealed an nAb GMT ratio of 1.90 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.31) of test : control against the JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 strain. The safety profile of the new XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine was found to be very similar to that of the Ancestral strain vaccine with 59 AEs (about 1 AE for every 8 doses administered) and 27 AEs (a little less than 1 AE for every 8 doses administered) respectively during the study. No serious AEs or AEs of special interest were reported in either the test or control arm of the study. Two cases of pyrexia were medically attended to, one in each arm. Interpretations Biological E's new XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine was found to be both safe and robustly immunogenic when administered as a two-dose booster series in 5 to 80 year olds. In particular, the vaccine induced a significant rise in neutralizing antibodies against the XBB.1.5 strain as well as cross-protective neutralizing antibodies against the JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 strain. These data are in line with studies of other XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccines and support a positive risk-benefit profile. Real world studies may provide additional evidence about the effectiveness of this new updated vaccine. CTRI Trial Registration Identifier: CTRI/2024/01/061423","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

Previous structural studies have advanced our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein architecture and function, however, the lack of high-resolution in situ structures of the glycoprotein tetramer and its lattice organization has limited mechanistic insights into viral assembly, entry, and antigenicity. Here, we leveraged a virus-like particle (VLP) system to establish a cryo-electron microscopy workflow for lattice-forming viral glycoproteins. This enabled the determination of a 2.35 [A] resolution structure of the membrane-embedded Andes virus (ANDV) glycoprotein tetramer, as well as structures of dimers of tetramers and a complex with antibody ADI-65534. These structures reveal previously uncharacterized features of glycoprotein organization, stability, and pH-sensing. Immunization of mice with self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) encoding ANDV-VLPs elicited high levels of glycoprotein-binding antibodies but equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to repRNA-encoded native ANDV glycoprotein complex. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein assemblies and their function, laying a foundation for structure-based vaccine design efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1750543703076

In ovules of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), one of the two synergid cells degenerates at fertilization, while the fertilized egg cell (zygote) undergoes directional elongation followed by asymmetric division to initiate embryonic patterning. However, morphological analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cell wall staining, which fails to label cells lacking complete walls, and by the requirement for transgenic fluorescent reporters to visualize cell outlines. Here, we report that the membrane-specific fluorescent dye FM4-64 readily permeates ovules, allowing clear visualization of reproductive cell morphology both before and after fertilization. This staining method supports high-resolution time-lapse imaging and quantitative analysis of early embryogenesis in living tissues. Importantly, it is applicable not only to the angiosperm A. thaliana but also to the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) and the fern Ceratopteris richardii (C. richardii), enabling the visualization of live reproductive cell structures within maternal tissues and revealing fertilization-associated morphological changes. This simple and robust method thus provides a valuable tool for spatiotemporal and quantitative analyses of reproductive processes across a broad range of plant species, without the need to generate transgenic lines.","NA","biorxiv",1750543703076

MethodsWe conducted a national retrospective database study including children born in 2008-2020. Individual-level data-linkage allowed examination of associations of sociodemographic variables with MMR and DTaP-IPV vaccination status at 2 years of age. Coverage for each variable, stratified by birth cohort, was calculated. Multivariable Poisson regression assessed independent associations and changes in coverage over time.

ResultsMMR coverage decreased in all population subgroups (overall 95% to 89% in 2008 and 2020 cohorts), with more substantial declines in some groups. The multivariable analysis showed that Dutch children of non-Dutch origin, particularly those of Moroccan and Turkish origin showed more pronounced declines (-25% and -12% compared to children of Dutch origin in cohort 2020, respectively). Among children not attending day care and children living in larger families ([&ge;]4 children), a faster decline in coverage was observed compared to those attending day care and living in smaller families (both -12% in cohort 2020). Among children of self-employed mothers and children in the lowest income households, lower coverage was observed compared to children of mothers in employment and children in the highest income households (-8% and -7% in cohort 2020, respectively). Nearly identical trends were observed for DTaP-IPV vaccination.

ConclusionOur study reveals a significant decline in childhood vaccination coverage in the Netherlands, with increasing disparities between sociodemographic groups. This is crucial for prioritising vaccination efforts to protect public health equitably.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

Here, we identify mislocalization of the RNA-binding protein FUS in cortical neurons as a defining feature in ALS patients with cognitive impairment (ALS-ci). Selective mislocalization of FUS in adult cortical projection neurons in mice is sufficient to trigger ALS-ci- and ALS with behavioral impairment (ALS-bi)-like phenotypes, including deficits in sociability, and neurodegeneration. Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal a conserved FUS-dependent gene network downregulated in these mice and ALS-ci patients. This regulon is enriched for ALS genetic risk factors and newly implicates FBXO16 in ALS-bi. Carriers of protein-truncating FBXO16 variants display behavioral abnormalities, frontotemporal atrophy, and increased levels of dementia-linked biomarkers. These findings define a neuron-intrinsic mechanism for cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in ALS and nominate FUS mislocalization and its downstream gene network as therapeutic targets.

Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

AtherOMICS is a biobanking project linking multi-omic atherosclerotic plaque phenotyping with blood biobanking, in vivo imaging, and clinical data. Since August 2022, 212 patients scheduled to undergo carotid or femoral endarterectomy at LMU Klinikum (Munich, Germany), have been enrolled (median age 73 years, 30.5% female). Plaques undergo systematic histological characterization of lipid core, calcification, intraplaque hemorrhage, fibrous cap, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells. Single-nuclei RNAseq (n=17) has highlighted macrophages as the dominant intraplaque cell type, whereas paired plaque and plasma affinity-based proteomics (n=88) quantified 2,841 shared proteins showing low plaque-plasma correlation (median {rho}=0.10). Cross-modality image integration (histology, ex vivo MRI, in vivo MRI, CTA) proved feasible. Taken together, AtherOMICS enables multimodal characterization of human atherosclerosis aiming for the discovery of athero-specific drug targets, molecular signatures of atheroprogression, and non-invasive biomarkers of plaque vulnerability.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

For this reason, the genetic profiles of Genghis Khan and his descendants are of keen academic and public interest. His Y-chromosome has been hypothesized to belong to haplogroup C3* (C2a1a3-F1918) but this has yet to be substantiated. To explore the genetic ancestry of Genghis Khan, we analyzed four archaeological individuals from the Golden Horde, including three males and one female, who were buried in separate medieval elite mausoleums in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. One of the males is believed to be Joshi (Juchi), the eldest son of Genghis Khan. We generated genomic data from these archaeological individuals and found that the three males were paternally related, sharing the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, consistent with the hypothesized signature haplotype of Genghis Khan. In addition, we confirm that the Golden Horde elites derived most of their genomes from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA) while having an additional ancestral component from either Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) or a Berel Scythian related population. Furthermore, we were able to identify their medieval relatives in the Mongolian Plateau through constructing an Identity by Descent (IBD) network.","NA","biorxiv",1750543703076

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750543703076
