To address this problem, we compared the fitness effects of chromosomal and plasmid genes in the plant symbiont Rhizobium leguminosarum. Here we show that plasmids are depleted in beneficial genes compared to the chromosome, and this effect is stronger for ancient plasmids compared to recently acquired plasmids. These findings support the hypothesis that evolution drives beneficial genes to become localized to the bacterial chromosome, resulting in a gradual decay in the ecological value of plasmids. These findings question the ecological importance of plasmids and highlight the challenge of understanding how plasmids persist over the long term.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

While the virus's overall resistance to human polyclonal antibody responses has steadily increased over time, the dynamics by which it escaped individual monoclonal antibodies within these responses have not been thoroughly explored. Recently, a series of studies by Cao et al. used deep mutational scanning (DMS) to identify which mutations allow the Wuhan-Hu-1 receptor-binding domain to escape binding by individual antibodies, doing so for thousands of antibodies. Here, we sought to use these data to retrospectively examine the evolutionary dynamics of escape from a set of 1,603 antibodies. For each antibody, we used the DMS data to predict an antibody-escape score for each of thousands of globally circulating viral sequences from the first 3.5 years of the pandemic, and then computed an escape trajectory that quantifies how the population's average escape score changed over time. We use pseudovirus neutralization data from Cao et al. and Wang et al. to validate common patterns in escape trajectories. While some trajectories increase monotonically over time, others show large fluctuations as a result of clade-displacement events that reduce the frequency of antibody-escape mutations in the viral population. Fitness effects of mutations estimated from natural sequences suggest that the mutations are displaced due to clonal interference. Further, these estimates suggest that the order in which escape mutations arose is shaped by changing selective pressures. Overall, this work helps describe how SARS-CoV-2 evaded the individual components of a polyclonal immune response in nature, and suggests that evasion occurred via complex evolutionary dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

ObjectiveThe primary objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the global prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes and symptoms in individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, while the secondary objective is to assess risk factors for long COVID in the same population.

Data SourcesStudies on long COVID published from July 5, 2021, to May 29, 2024, searched from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were used for this systematic review. Supplemental updates to the original search period were made.

Study SelectionThere were four inclusion criteria: (1) human study population with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis; (2) appropriate index diagnosis date; (3) outcome must include either prevalence, risk factors, duration, or symptoms of long COVID; and (4) follow-up time of at least two months after the index date. The exclusion criteria were: (1) non-human study population; (1) case studies or reviews; (2) studies with imaging, molecular, and/or cellular testing as primary results; (3) studies with specific populations such as healthcare workers, residents of nursing homes, and/or those living in long-term care facilities; and (4) studies that did not meet the sample size threshold needed to estimate overall prevalence with margin of error of 0.05.

Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo screeners independently performed screenings and data extraction, and decision conflicts were collectively resolved. The data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis framework with a DerSimonian-Laird inverse variance weighted estimator.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary estimand (target population parameter of interest) was the prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes among individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, and the secondary estimand was effect sizes corresponding to ten common risk factors of long COVID in the same population.

ResultsA total of 442 studies were included in this mega-systematic review, and 429 were meta-analyzed for various endpoints, avoiding duplicate estimates from the same study. Of the 442 studies, 17.9% of the studies have a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity is evident among meta-analyzed studies, where the I2 statistic is nearly 100% in studies that estimate overall prevalence. Global estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID was 36% among COVID-19 positive individuals (95% confidence interval [CI] 33%-40%) estimated from 144 studies. Geographical variation was observed in the estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID: Asia at 35% (95% CI 25%-46%), Europe at 39% (95% CI 31%-48%), North America at 30% (95% CI 24%-38%), and South America at 51% (95% CI 35%-66%). Stratifying by follow-up duration, the estimated pooled prevalence for individuals with longer follow-up periods of 1 to 2 years (47% [95% CI 37%-57%]) compared to those with follow-up times of less than 1 year (35% [95% CI 31%-39%]) had overlapping CI and were therefore not statistically distinguishable. Top five most prevalent long COVID subtypes among COVID-19 positive cases were respiratory at 20% (95% CI 14%-28%) estimated from 31 studies, general fatigue at 20% (95% CI 18%-23%) estimated from 121 studies, psychological at 18% (95% CI 11%-28%) estimated from 10 studies, neurological at 16% (95% CI 8%-30%) estimated from 23 studies, and dermatological at 12% (95% CI 8%-17%) estimated from 10 studies. The most common symptom based on estimated prevalence was memory problems estimated at 11% (95% CI 7%-19%) meta-analyzed from 12 studies. The three strongest risk factors for long COVID were being unvaccinated for COVID-19, pre-existing comorbidity, and female sex. Individuals with any of these risk factors had higher odds of having long COVID with pooled estimated odds ratios of 2.34 (95% CI 1.49-3.67) meta-analyzed from 6 studies, 1.59 (95% CI 1.28-1.97) from 13 studies, and 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.92) from 22 studies, respectively.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis study shows long COVID is globally prevalent in the COVID-19 positive population with highly varying estimates. The prevalence of long COVID persists over extended follow-up, with a high burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection. Our findings highlight long COVID and its subtypes as a continuing health challenge worldwide. The heterogeneity of the estimates across populations and geographical regions argues for the need for carefully designed follow-up with representative studies across the world.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the prevalence and patterns of long COVID and its subtypes, and what are the risk factors of long COVID?

ResultsMeta-analysis of 429 studies published from 2021-2024 estimated a pooled global long COVID prevalence of 36% in COVID-19 positive individuals. Variations in geographical regions showed that South America had the highest pooled prevalence of 51% (95% CI: 35%-66%), and the prevalence does not seem to diminish with extended follow-up (less than 1 year: 35%, 95% CI: 31%-39% vs. 1 to 2 years: 47%, 95% CI: 37%-57%). The estimated pooled prevalence of eight major long COVID subtypes in COVID-19 positive individuals were 20% (respiratory), 20% (general fatigue), 18% (psychological), 16% (neurological), 12% (dermatological), 10% (cardiovascular), 9% (musculoskeletal) and 5% (gastrointestinal).

MeaningQuantitative evidence shows a persistent prevalence of long COVID globally, with a significant burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection, underscoring the need for having accurate and standardized diagnostic tests and biomarkers for long COVID, a better understanding of the physiology of the condition, its treatment, and its potential effect on healthcare needs and workforce participation. The heterogeneity and wide range of the prevalence estimates call for representative samples in well-designed follow-up studies of long COVID across the world.","NA","medrxiv",1737842956041

The mainstay for analyzing SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine efficacy has been assessment of serum IgG levels; however, validated assays for assessment of mucosal IgA in clinical samples are necessary as new and adapted measures are generated to combat immune-evasive viral variants. A mucosal IgA assay was developed and tested through assessment of IgA levels in salivary samples from participants of the 2019nCoV-314/ NCT05973006 study. These participants had previously received [&ge;]2 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations prior to enrollment and received a single intramuscular study dose of NVX-CoV2601 (XBB.1.5) or bivalent vaccine (NVX-CoV2601 + NVX-CoV2373 [Wuhan]). Salivary samples were collected prior to vaccination on day 0 and on day 28 to assess response post vaccination. Both vaccine groups elicited a significant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgA against XBB.1.5. Furthermore, cross-reactivity via identification of anti-JN.1 and anti-Wuhan IgA was also observed. The detection of IgA in clinical mucosal samples through this assay will be a valuable tool in supporting vaccine development.","NA","medrxiv",1737842956041

Here, we identify a new mechanism for regulation of p62 oligomerization and incorporation into p62 bodies by SHKBP1, a Cullin-3 E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor, that is independent of its potential functions in ubiquitination. We map a SHKBP1-p62 protein-protein interaction outside of p62 bodies that limits p62 assembly into p62 bodies and affects the antioxidant response by preventing sequestration and degradation of Keap1. These studies provide a non-ubiquitination-based mechanism for an E3 ligase adaptor in regulating p62 phase separation and cellular responses to oxidative stress.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

AMR plasmids allow bacteria to survive antibiotic treatments, but they also produce physiological alterations in their hosts that commonly translate into fitness costs. Despite the key role of plasmid-associated fitness effects in AMR evolution, their origin and molecular bases remain poorly understood. In this study, we introduce plasmid-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens as a tool to dissect plasmid-associated fitness effects. We designed and performed CRISPRi screens targeting the globally distributed carbapenem resistance plasmid pOXA-48 in 13 different multidrug resistant clinical enterobacteria. Our results revealed that pOXA-48 gene-level effects are conserved across clinical strains, and exposed the key role of the carbapenemase-encoding gene, blaOXA-48, as the main responsible for pOXA-48 fitness costs. Moreover, our results highlighted the relevance of postsegregational killing systems in pOXA-48 vertical transmission, and uncovered new genes implicated in pOXA-48 stability.

Temporal changes in hematopoiesis parallel age-dependent incidences of blood diseases. Several heterochronic regulators of hematopoiesis have been identified, but how the master transcription factor (TF) circuitry of definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adapts over the lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that expression of the ETS family TF Erg is adult-biased, and that programmed upregulation of Erg expression during juvenile to adult aging is evolutionarily conserved and required for complete implementation of adult patterns of HSC self-renewal and myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid differentiation. Erg deficiency maintains fetal transcriptional and epigenetic programs, and persistent juvenile phenotypes in Erg haploinsufficient mice are dependent on deregulation of the fetal-biased TF Hmga2. Finally, Erg haploinsufficiency in the adult results in fetal-like resistance to leukemogenesis. Overall, we identify a mechanism whereby HSC TF networks are rewired to specify stage-specific hematopoiesis, a finding directly relevant to age-biased blood diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

NRC proteins are classified as CNL, which contain a coiled-coil (CC) domain in their N-terminal region. Previous studies highlighted the importance of the MADA motif in the first alpha helix of the CC domain for NRC-mediated defense responses. However, how other alpha helices in the CC domain contribute to NRC function remains unclear. In this study, we identified a novel hydrophobic feature localized in the CC domain barrel that contributes to NRC-mediated immunity. We screened the conserved hydrophobic residues among NRCs and identified seven required for NRC4-mediated cell death. Structural analysis revealed that four of these residues form a hydrophobic center in the CC domain. We further demonstrated that this hydrophobic core is important for NRC4 subcellular localization, oligomerization, and phospholipid association, but not for NRC4 focal accumulation on the extra-haustorial membrane during Phytophthora infestans infection. By comparing sequences of multiple NLRs in the NRC superclade, we found that the residues of the hydrophobic core in sensor NLRs exhibit greater diversity than those in helper NLRs. Cell death assays indicated that the function of the hydrophobic core has degenerated in certain sensor NLRs but remains essential in NRCs and ZAR1. Overall, our study highlights a novel hydrophobic feature in the CC domain of the NRC and its contribution to NLR-mediated immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

Historical contingencies arise when elements from an organism's past leave lasting effects on the genome, altering the paths available for adaptation. We utilize strains isolated before and after widespread antibiotic use to study the impact of deep historical differences shaped by decades of evolution in varying antibiotic and host pressures. We evaluated these effects by comparing immediate and adaptive responses of two strains of Acinetobacter baumannii to the last-resort antibiotic, tigecycline (TGC). When grown in subinhibitory TGC, the two strains demonstrated divergent transcriptional responses suggesting that baseline transcript levels may dictate global responses to drug and their subsequent evolutionary trajectories. Experimental evolution in TGC revealed clear differences in population-genetic dynamics - with hard sweeps in populations founded by one strain and no mutations reaching fixation in the other strain. Transcriptomes of evolved populations no longer showed signatures of drug response, as was seen in the ancestors, suggesting that genetic adaptation may outweigh preexisting differences in transcriptional networks. Genetically, AMR was acquired through predictable mechanisms of increased efflux and drug target modification; however, the two strains adapted by mutations in different efflux regulators. Fitness tradeoffs of AMR were only observed in lineages evolved from the pre-antibiotic era strain, suggesting that decades of adaptation to antibiotics resulted in preexisting compensatory mechanisms in the more contemporary isolate, an important example of a beneficial effect of historical contingencies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Acinetobacter baumannii is a high priority pathogen often causing multidrug resistant nosocomial infections. Many healthcare systems experience clonal outbreaks of A. baumannii infections, yet treatment strategies are often strain-agnostic, ignoring the importance of strain differences. We show that historical differences between two strains, one isolated prior to widespread antibiotic use and the other following decades of selection to clinical conditions, dictate transcriptional patterns and response to a last-resort antibiotic and influence the genetic and phenotypic routes of resistance adaptation. While our study focuses on two reference strains of A. baumannii, these findings can be more broadly applicable to other pathogenic organisms in which a better understanding of the forces influencing resistance adaptation is essential for combating the antimicrobial resistance crisis.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

This pivotal enzyme has long been observed to be kinetically constrained. Yet, this impression is based on kinetic measurements heavily focused on eukaryotic rubiscos, a rather conserved group of low genetic diversity. Moreover, the fastest rubiscos that we know of so far were found among the sparsely sampled prokaryotes. Could there be yet faster rubiscos among the uncharted regions of rubiscos phylogenetic diversity? Here, we perform a characterization of more than 250 rubiscos from a wide range of bacteria and archaea, thereby doubling the coverage of the diversity of this key enzyme. We assess the distribution of the carboxylation rates at saturating levels of CO2, and establish that rubisco is a relatively slow enzyme across the tree of life, never exceeding {approx}20 reactions per second. We show that relatively faster subclades share similar evolutionary contexts, involving micro-oxygenic environments or a CO2 concentrating mechanism. Leveraging a simple machine learning model trained on this dataset, we predict the carboxylation rate for all {approx}68,000 sequenced rubisco variants found in nature to date. This study provides the largest and most diverse dataset of natural variants for an enzyme and their associated rates, establishing a solid benchmark for future efforts to predict catalytic rates from sequence data.

SignificanceDiscovering a fast carboxylating rubisco has been a long-standing challenge in the scientific community, given its potential impact on sustainable food and fuel production. Yet, only a small fraction of rubiscos natural diversity has been kinetically characterized.

Focusing on genetic clusters with above-average rates, we show that rubiscos catalytic rate does not exceed {approx}20 reactions per second. Supported by a machine-learning predictive model, we extend this finding to all sequenced natural variants.

However, key regulators of these pleotropic traits have yet to be identified. Here, we discovered a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), FAM151B-DT, that is reduced in a stem cell model of frontotemporal dementia with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and in brains from FTLD-tau, progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease patients. We show that silencing FAM151B-DT in vitro is sufficient to enhance tau aggregation. To begin to understand the mechanism by which FAM151B-DT mediates tau aggregation and contributes to several neurodegenerative diseases, we deeply characterized this novel lncRNA and found that FAM151B-DT resides in the cytoplasm where it interacts with tau, -synuclein, HSC70, and other proteins enriched in protein homeostasis. When silenced, FAM151B-DT blocks autophagy, leading to the accumulation of tau and -synuclein. Importantly, we discovered that increasing FAM151B-DT expression is sufficient to promote autophagic flux, reduce phospho-tau and -synuclein, and reduce tau aggregation. Overall, these findings pave the way for further exploration of FAM151B-DT as a promising molecular target for several neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1737842956041

However, cross-fed metabolites are often only available at low concentrations, limiting the growth rates of gene-loss mutants that are dependent on those metabolites. Here we define conditions that support a loss of function mutant in a three-member bacterial community of: (i) N2-utilizing Rhodopseudomonas palustris as an NH4+-excreting producer, (ii) N2-utilizing Vibrio natriegens as the ancestor, and (iii) a V. natriegens N2-utilizaton mutant that is dependent on the producer for NH4+. Using experimental and simulated cocultures, we found that the ancestor outcompeted the mutant due to low NH4+ availability under uniform conditions where both V. natriegens strains have equal access to nutrients. However, spatial structuring that separated the mutant from the ancestor, while maintaining access to NH4+ from the producer, allowed the mutant to avoid extinction. Counter to predictions, mutant enrichment under spatially structured conditions did not require a growth rate advantage from gene loss and the mutant coexisted with its ancestor. Thus, cross-feeding can originate from loss-of-function mutations that are otherwise detrimental, provided that the mutant can segregate from a competitive ancestor.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

Here, we demonstrate that our lentivirally (LV) manufactured R110-CAR T cells, targeting a leukemia neoepitope, can also be engineered using non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposition with minimal-sized DNA vectors. Flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing was used to compare the two production modes using healthy donor and CLL patient-derived T cells and a CD19-CAR T cell control. SB products were shifted towards CD8+ subsets with expression of activation/co-inhibition markers (CD69, LAG-3, TIM-3) despite their naive-like phenotype and lack of antigenic challenge. The CAR binding moiety modulated these patterns with R110-CAR T cells showing more aberrant phenotypes. Moreover, SB engineering resulted in inflammatory signatures along with RIG-I-like and TOLL-like nucleotide sensing potentially resulting from the transfection procedure. Patient-derived products showed significantly fewer CAR-expressing cells, reduced proliferation clusters, and lower T cell diversity, particularly with SB manufacturing, pointing at potential challenges with this method when engineering CLL T cells. Together, our data suggest that the engineering mode may substantially influence T cell properties and that these are further modulated by the CAR binding moiety and the type of T cell donor.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

We developed a simple regression-based point score in 2020 based on an objective of forecasting critical care occupancy in the Canadian province of Ontario based on mean age of cases, case numbers, and testing volume. Evolution of the pandemic (variants of concern, vaccination) led us to re-assess and re-calibrate our earlier work, with inclusion of information vaccination which became widespread in 2021.

MethodsWe obtained complete provincial SARS-CoV-2 case, testing, and vaccination data for the period from March 2020 to September 2022, with data subdivided into 6 major ""waves"", following the approach applied by other Canadian investigators. Our initial model was fit only using the first two ""wild type"" SARS-CoV-2 waves; an updated model included wave 3 (N501Y+ variants). Our model was validated by comparing model projections to waves not used for model fitting; validation model fits were evaluated with Spearmans rho; counterfactuals without vaccination were modeled to impute fraction of critical care admissions prevented with vaccination. Costing was based on published economic estimates.

ResultsOur initial model (fit to waves 1 and 2) was well calibrated (rho 0.85) but predictive validity was modest (rho 0.46). Predictive validity improved in models fit to the first 3 pandemic waves without vaccination (rho 0.60) or with vaccination (rho 0.68) (P for inclusion of vaccination 0.013 by Likelihood Ratio Test). Prevented fraction of ICU admissions attributable to vaccination was 144% (22017 admissions expected vs. 9020 observed); based on published estimates of ICU admission cost for SARS-CoV-2 the 12977 admissions averted $2.9 (CDN) billion in economic costs, in contrast to the $3 billion total cost of the vaccination program.

ConclusionsSimple time series regression incorporating case and testing characteristics continues to be useful as a tool for forecasting critical care occupancy due to SARS-CoV-2 but early pandemic models need to be updated to capture the preventive effects of widespread vaccination. The economic benefit of vaccination for prevention of critical care resource consumption during the pandemic is substantial, achieving near cost neutrality with the provinces entire vaccination program.","NA","medrxiv",1737842956041

The loss of either RSRC2 or C1QTNF1-AS1 results in defects in chromosome congression and mitotic progression. We show that RSRC2 interacts with distinct sets of proteins involved in splicing and centrosome biogenesis, contributing to the fidelity of cell division through two different mechanisms: one linked to the splicing of mitotic regulators and the other by localising to mitotic centrosomes for which the interaction with the C1QTNF1-AS1 RNA is required.

Functionally and structurally distinct chromatin domains are defined by the so-called histone code, which consists of combinations of post-translational histone modifications deposited by ""code writers"" and recognized by ""code readers."" The primary mark of heterochromatin, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), is deposited by histone methyltransferases, such as SetDB1, and serves as a binding platform for readers, most notably HP1 family proteins. Using a reporter system to monitor the dynamics of heterochromatin establishment and maintenance, we demonstrated that transient tethering of HP1 triggers the SetDB1-dependent establishment of stable heterochromatin. This finding indicates the presence of a feedback mechanism wherein the reader of the H3K9me3 mark recruits the writer. We further discovered that the genetic interaction between SetDB1 and HP1 is mirrored by a direct physical interaction. This interaction requires the auto-methylation of two conserved histone mimic motifs located in unstructured regions of SetDB1. HP1 binds these SetDB1 motifs using the same molecular interface it employs to recognize the modified histone tail. Our findings show that SetDB1 auto-methylation is essential for the spreading and stable maintenance of heterochromatin. This includes its roles in processes such as X-chromosome inactivation and the negative feedback regulation of a large gene family encoding KRAB-ZNF transcriptional repressors. Thus, the primary heterochromatin mark is not limited to nucleosomes but is also deployed on the mark's writer itself. This fosters a direct physical interaction between the writer and the reader, ensuring key features of heterochromatin: its spreading to establish extended domains and its stable maintenance through cell divisions.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

While carboxysome number, size and spatial organization are observed to vary in different environmental conditions (CO2, light, temperature, light quality), molecular mechanisms underlying this potentially adaptive process remain elusive. Herein, we observed that mutants of the circadian rhythm/metabolism factor, Regulator of Phycobilisome Associated A (RpaA), exhibit a striking breakdown of carboxysomes under certain environmental conditions. We find that growth conditions leading to overreduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool (mixotrophic growth, high irradiance, or chemical inhibition of electron transfer from PQ to the cytochrome b6f complex) are accompanied by elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and correlate with carboxysome breakdown. Carboxysome breakdown is reversed by environmental conditions or chemical inhibitors that prevent PQ overreduction and accompanying ROS generation. Taken together, our data supports a novel link between the redox status of the PQ pool and carboxysome status and/or integrity. Our results have implications for fundamental understanding of cyanobacterial energy balancing pathways and may indicate new research directions for understanding how the carboxysome is remodeled in response to changing environments.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

Quantification of cytokine production with single-molecule RNA imaging demonstrates stimulus-specific patterns of response to restimulation at the single cell level. Differential licensing of inflammatory transcription factors is associated with encoding of specificities in chromatin. Trained cells show stronger responses to secondary stimuli that are more similar to the initial stimulus they experienced, suggesting a functional role for these stimulus-specific memories. Rather than activating a universal training state, our findings demonstrate that different stimuli impart specific memories that generate distinct training phenotypes in macrophages.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

The acquisition of effector signatures in Treg cells is closely tied to the surrounding tissue-specific immune environment and typically occurs alongside Foxp3 expression. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic and functional consequences of Treg-mediated regulation in a Th2-driven disease setting. The application of both in vitro systems and in vivo disease models allowed us to mimic Th2-mediated environments.

We could demonstrate Th2-driven loss of Foxp3 expression in Treg cells in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a maintained Treg signature despite the loss of active Foxp3 expression. Functional characterization of Tregs both in vitro and in vivo uncovered a preserved suppressive capacity even in the absence of Foxp3.

Our findings unveil that, despite loss of Foxp3, a preserved Treg signature remains intact enabling the regulation of Th2-mediated diseases. The persistence of this regulatory transcriptome highlights the importance for developing Treg-cell therapy strategies in cancer and autoimmune diseases independent of Foxp3 expression.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

The selection of appropriate symbionts is paramount for the host to gain valuable nutrients and could be tailored to increase stress tolerance against anthropogenic induced changes in ocean environments, such as coral bleaching in response to ocean warming. Previous research suggests glycan-lectin interactions play a role in symbiont uptake; however, blockage of such interactions does not fully inhibit symbiosis establishment, suggesting other receptors are at play. Potential candidates include RGD peptide binding integrins, which are known to mediate phagocytosis of microbes in other systems. Here, we used a combination of cnidarian model systems and human cell lines to determine if integrins facilitate symbiont recognition and uptake. Integrins are highly expressed in the endodermal tissue of the host, where symbiosis takes place, and upon uptake into endodermal cells, symbionts altered the expression of integrins and downstream signaling molecules. Blockage of integrin binding sites with RGD competitor peptides reduced symbiont uptake, but had no effect on the general uptake of non-symbiotic algae, or uptake in a non-symbiotic cnidarian. In addition, inert beads coated with integrin RGD peptide ligands were phagocytosed more readily than beads coated with scrambled peptide. Finally, overexpression of RGD-binding integrins in human cells increased symbiont uptake and mutation of the active binding site abolished uptake. Our findings reveal RGD-binding integrins as key players in symbiosis establishment and shed light on the evolutionary functions of integrins as phagocytic receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

BvlzGluc specifically targets the beta-glucan layer of Botrytis cinerea, causing significant structural malformations, impaired fungal development, and reduced virulence. These effects weaken the fungal cell wall, increasing its susceptibility to environmental stress and reducing its capacity to infect host plants. Notably, BvlzGluc is a noncanonical beta-glucanase belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16) but presents unique structural features that distinguish it from typical members of this family, suggesting potential reclassification. Its physicochemical stability and simple structural design increase its suitability for scalable production, positioning it as a promising candidate for agricultural and industrial applications requiring efficient beta-glucan degradation.

In this article, we consider a population structured according to the island model, and use two and three-locus analytical models and multilocus simulations to explore the selective forces acting on a modifier locus affecting the rate of sexual reproduction of facultatively sexual organisms, in the presence of recurrent deleterious mutations. The results show that population structure and selection combine to generate a local excess of heterozygotes at selected loci (negative $F_{\mathrm{IS}}$), for both partially recessive and partially dominant deleterious alleles. The linkage disequilibrium between deleterious alleles may be either negative or positive depending on their dominance coefficient, the degree of population structure and the rate of sex. These genetic associations combine with many other ones to generate indirect selection at the sex modifier locus, generally favoring intermediate rates of sex even when sex entails direct fitness costs. Multilocus simulations show that the equilibrium rate of sex increases moderately as the degree of population structure increases. However, population structure may also prevent the irreversible spread of asexual mutants when the cost of sex is strong.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

Mitochondrial K+ influx is associated with increased osmotic pressure, promoting water influx and increasing matrix volume. Since BAT mitochondria have lower inner membrane potentials due to uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) activity, we hypothesized this could involve compensatory changes in MitoKATP activity, and thus tested MitoKATP involvement in brown adipocyte activities under basal and stimulated conditions. We find that cold exposure and adrenergic stimulation in mice modulate BAT MitoK levels, the channel portion of MitoKATP. Genetic ablation of the gene that codes for the pore-forming subunit of MitoKATP in human pre-adipocytes decreased cellular respiration and proliferation, compromising differentiation into mature adipocytes. In mouse cell lines, the absence of the protein limited cellular oxygen consumption in the precursor stage, but not in mature adipocytes. Interestingly, inhibition of MitoKATP in mature adipocytes increased adrenergic-stimulated oxygen consumption, indicating that shutdown of this pathway is important for full BAT thermogenesis. Similarly, MitoKATP inhibition increased oxygen consumption in BAT mitochondria isolated from mice treated with beta 3 adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243. Overall, our results suggest that the activity of MitoKATP regulates differentiation and metabolism of brown adipocytes, impacting on thermogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

Missense pathogenicity predictions from AlphaMissense based on structural context and protein language models improve the differentiation between benign and deleterious variants. Constraint metrics, on the other hand, allow researchers to pinpoint genomic regions under selective pressure that may not directly impact protein structure, but are more likely to contain functionally important mutations. Loss-of-function (LoF) variants, which result in the complete or partial loss of protein function, are particularly informative, as it is more straightforward to assess their downstream functional consequences. In this study, we present a unified meta regression model approach that incorporates the probability of pathogenicity, probability of constraint, and indicator whether a variant is a predicted loss-of-function or missense variant as features to model the observed effect size and uncertainty of effect size obtained from single-variant genetic analysis. We applied the unified meta regression model to 1,144 continuous phenotypes from UK Biobank using single variant summary statistics obtained from Genebass. We replicated our findings using the AllofUS cohort. For each gene discovery, we make available a characterization of whether constrained sites are associated with the phenotype, whether pathogenic sites determined by structural based predictions are associated with phenotype, and whether broader loss-of-function or missense variant annotation better explains the summary statistics observed.

Positive delta in adults is normally interpreted as implying that an individual is aging (or has aged) faster than the population norm, an indicator of unhealthy aging. Unfortunately, from cross-sectional (single timepoint) imaging data, it is impossible to know whether a single individuals positive delta reflects a state of faster ongoing aging, or an unvarying trait (in other words, a ""historical baseline effect"" in the context of the population being studied). However, for a cross-sectional dataset comprising many individuals, one could attempt to disambiguate the overall relative contributions of varying aging rates vs. fixed baseline effects. We present a method for doing this, and show that for the most common approaches, which estimate a single delta per subject, baseline effects are likely to dominate. If instead one estimates multiple biologically distinct modes of brain aging, we find that some modes do reflect aging rates varying strongly across subjects. We demonstrate this, and verify our modelling, using longitudinal (two timepoint) data from 4,400 participants in UK Biobank. In addition, whereas previous work found incompatibility between cross-sectional and longitudinal brain aging, we show that careful data processing does show consistency between cross-sectional and longitudinal results.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

We identify differentially abundant metabolites related to aging, determine frailty related metabolites via a machine learning approach, and generate a union set of frailty features, both in the whole cohort and in sex-stratified subgroups. Using the features, we perform an association study and build a metabolomics-based frailty clock.

We identify B vitamin metabolism related flavin adenine dinucleotide and pyridoxate as female-specific frailty biomarkers, and lipid metabolism related sphingomyelins, glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine as male-specific frailty biomarkers. These associations are confirmed in a validation cohort, with ergothioneine and perfluorooctanesulfonate identified as robust frailty biomarkers.

In this study, we annotated TE transcripts in publicly available RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of postmortem human brain tissue to investigate the expression profile of TE transcripts in individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) compared to healthy controls. Our findings reveal a robust and uniform downregulation of TE transcript expression in the brains of subjects with MDD relative to controls, this occurs most prominently in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) brain region, and MDD differentially impacts this TE expression by age and sex.

To investigate this limitation in LLMs, we employed the classic color Stroop task that is widely regarded as the gold standard for testing executive control of attention. Our results revealed a typical conflict effect of better performance in terms of accuracy in the congruent condition (e.g., naming the ink color of the word RED) compared to incongruent condition (e.g., naming the ink color of the word RED), which is similar to human performance, in short sequences. However, as sequence length increased, the performance degraded toward chance levels on the incongruent trials despite maintaining excellent performance on congruent trials and near-perfect word reading ability. These findings demonstrate that while transformer attention mechanisms can achieve human-comparable performance in smaller contexts, they are fundamentally limited in their capacity for conflict resolution across extended contexts. This study suggests that incorporating executive control mechanisms akin to those in biological attention could be crucial for achieving more general reasoning and reliable performance toward artificial general intelligence.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956041

The 5 year (2018-2022) underlying-cause-of-death data were analyzed for different race/ethnicity groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers of the colon/rectum, pancreas, liver/bile duct, and stomach contributed to more than a quarter of cancer deaths in the US, calling for focused advocacy. Known disparities for Black non-Hispanic Americans were verified in cancers of the colon/rectum, and pancreas. However, mortality data for ""More than one race"" non-Hispanic group or non-White Hispanic group appeared unreliable, suggesting that under-reporting is also a sign of health disparity. Age-specific death rates (ASDRs) were calculated to view health disparities in various age groups. Cancers of the colon/rectum, liver, and stomach cause significant mortality in the under-50 population. And minority groups are more likely to die from cancers in the liver or the stomach compared to the White non-Hispanics. Liver cancer crude death rate was lower than expect in Asian Non-Hipanics when compared with the high mortalities of IARCs GLOBOCAN estimates for Asian countries. Census data were then used to calculate Asian sub-groups ASDRs. Significantly higher risks were seen in gastric cancer for Korean Americans and liver cancer for Vietnamese Americans. The Asian Indian group had the lowest death rates across several GI cancers, even in gallbladder cancer. Some immigrants go back to their birth countries at end of life and these deaths are not reflected in WONDER because consulate reports of American citizens deaths abroad do not include race/ethnicity data.

SIGNIFICANCEGastrointestinal cancers should be advocacy focuses to promote cancer equity. Under-reporting of deaths for minority groups is a sign of health disparity. ASDRs (Age Specific Death Rates) provide bases for tailored screening and prevention. Exclusion of American citizens deaths abroad in U.S. public health datasets may mask care access issues faced by immigrant cancer patients who may die overseas. Updating how these deaths are reported will help address this issue.","NA","medrxiv",1737842956042

Anopheles funestus is the dominant malaria vector in Tanzania and most parts of East and Southern Africa. To better understand its population genomic structure in Tanzania, we sequenced the genomes of 334 individual An. funestus mosquitoes from 11 administrative regions. We found two genetically differentiated populations; one inland and at high altitude (found in Katavi, Kagera, Kigoma, and Mwanza) and a second coastal, at low altitude (found in Pwani, Morogoro, Tanga, Ruvuma, Mtwara, Dodoma, and Lindi), with differences in genetic diversity and inbreeding. We found asynchronous selective sweeps, associated with insecticide resistance phenotypes, at the Cyp9k1 gene, and Cyp6p gene cluster, with distinct copy number-variant profiles between the coastal and inland populations. These results suggest that inland and coastal An. funestus populations have divergent histories, with the arid, central region of Tanzania, which also contains the Rift Valley being a possible barrier to gene flow. Such population disconnectedness should be considered for insecticide deployment, resistance management, and the rollout of novel genetic- based vector control approaches. These findings provide the most detailed study of Tanzanian An. funestus population structure and resistance genetics to date. Future research should examine the epidemiological relevance of this discontinuity in gene flow and whether these populations have different malaria transmission abilities.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

The production of these pigments is governed in part by Agouti Signaling Protein (ASIP) and the Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) to which it binds. The most common background coat colors in mammals result from alternating bands of dark eumelanin and light pheomelanin within individual hairs. However, coats dominated by a single type of melanin have arisen several times. Here, we examine the genetic basis of two instances among the marsupials: a melanistic morph of the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) found at high frequency in the wild, and a rare case of fixed xanthism in the marsupial moles. In the eastern quoll, we show that a deletion encompassing part of the ASIP coding sequence likely explains melanism in this species. Notably, this mutation is convergent with that recently discovered in its dark-coated relative, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii). Conversely, we show that a nonsense mutation which severely truncates MC1R in the southern marsupial mole (Notoryctes typhlops) is a strong candidate driver of its pheomelanin-predominant coat. Together with other recent findings, our results suggest that loss-of-function mutations have occurred repeatedly within the marsupials, representing an important mechanism underpinning coat color variation.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy. Furthermore, simulation demonstrates that repeated boosters, given every few months, are needed to maintain this misleading impression of efficacy.

We assessed baseline associations between Pb and Cd concentrations in dried blood spots with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) among women in the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. We analyzed data from three of the four HAPIN randomized controlled trial sites (Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda), focusing on women aged 40 to 79 years living in households reliant on biomass cooking. Dried blood spots were collected, processed, and analyzed for Pb and Cd exposure; SBP and DBP were measured following international guidelines. Demographic, socioeconomic, and dietary variables were collected via standardized questionnaires administered by local field staff. Statistical analyses included multivariable linear regression to examine associations between Pb and Cd, separately, and BP, adjusting for covariates informed by a Directed Acyclic Graph. Additional analyses assessed effect modification by age and research site. There was regional variation in BP levels among women, with median SBP and DBP values higher in Rwanda (116.3 mmHg, 73.0 mmHg) and Guatemala (113.3 mmHg, 68.3 mmHg) compared to Peru (106.0 mmHg, 63.3 mmHg).

The setup allows for the creation of multiple behavioral paradigms, two of which are highlighted here: a two-alternative forced-choice auditory-motor discrimination paradigm, and a two-armed bandit value-based decision-making task. In the auditory-motor paradigm, mice learn to report high or low frequency tones by pushing or pulling the joystick. In the value-based paradigm, mice learn to push or pull the joystick based on the history of rewarded trials. In addition to reporting categorical choices, this setup provides a rich dataset of motor parameters that reflect components of the underlying learning and decision processes in both of these tasks. These kinematic parameters (including joystick speed and displacement, Frechet similarity of trajectories, tortuosity, angular standard deviation, and movement vigor) provide key additional insights into the motor execution of choices that are not as readily assessed in other paradigms. The systems flexibility of task design, joystick readout, and ease of construction represent an advance compared to currently available manipulandum tasks in mice.

We found that Egfl7 KO mice had decreases in overall BM cellularity resulting in significant reduction in the number of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which was due to dysregulation of normal cell-cycle progression along with a corresponding increase in quiescence. rEGFL7 treatment rescued our observed hematopoietic defects of Egfl7 KO mice and enhanced HSC expansion after genotoxic stress such as 5-FU and irradiation.

Here, we report an ongoing development of PHYLA, an architecture that operates on an explicit, higher-level semantic representation of phylogenetic trees. PHYLA employs a hybrid state-space transformer architecture and a novel tree loss function to achieve state-of-the-art performance on sequence reasoning benchmarks and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. To validate PHYLAs capabilities, we applied it to reconstruct the tree of life, where PHYLA accurately reclassified archaeal organisms, such as Lokiarchaeota, as more closely related to bacteria--aligning with recent phylogenetic insights. PHYLA represents a step toward molecular sequence reasoning, emphasizing structured reasoning over memorization and advancing protein sequence analysis and phylogenetic inference.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Silhouette is an established metric for assessing clustering results, comparing within-cluster cohesion to between-cluster separation, and adaptations of it have emerged as the dominant choice to evaluate the success of these integration methods. However, silhouette's assumptions are often violated in single-cell data integration scenarios. We demonstrate that silhouette-based metrics can neither reliably assess batch effect removal nor biological signal conservation and are thus inherently unsuitable for data with (nested) batch effects. We propose alternative, robust evaluation strategies that enable accurate integration method assessment and call to update benchmarking practices.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

C. elegans spe-11 is one of the few known paternal-effect embryonic lethal genes. We report that the sperm protein, SPE-11, forms a complex with an oocyte protein, OOPS-1 (Oocyte Partner of SPE-11), and that the protein complex is required for the completion of meiosis, the block to polyspermy, and eggshell formation. Consistent with the molecular interaction of their encoded proteins, oops-1 and spe-11 exhibit identical null phenotypes, displaying defects in meiotic progression and cytokinesis. We show that the complex binds F-actin in the absence of other proteins and inhibits the nucleation of actin filaments in vitro. Thus, the OOPS-1-SPE-11 complex may function to promote F-actin-mediated meiotic cytokinesis. Both OOPS-1 and SPE-11 are intrinsically disordered proteins that are highly phosphorylated. Biochemical and genetic experiments define interactions with the protein phosphatase 1 homologs GSP-3/4, which appear to promote OOPS-1-SPE-11 function. Genetic results support a model in which the OOPS-1-SPE-11 complex interacts with the cortical EGG complex to promote meiotic cytokinesis and to activate synthesis of the eggshell.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

As kelp cultivation intensifies in North America, kelp disease prevalence is expected to increase in tandem. With input from the kelp-growing community through an online survey, we describe the prevalence of a novel kelp disease, pink-spot disease, which has been observed in Canada and the United States on Saccharina latissima, Alaria marginata, Nereocystis luetkeana, and Macrocystis tenuifolia. Eight of the fourteen (57%) surveyed kelp growers report bright pink spots (pink-spot disease) on their kelp spools in the land-based nursery stage. Along with the grower survey, we conducted 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in 2021 and 2022 to investigate the causative agent of pink-spot disease and associated bacterial community changes on infected Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp) spools. Our data in both years show that a member of the genus Algicola is enriched on visibly diseased spool regions compared to asymptomatic spool regions and may be the causative agent of pink-spot disease. As macroalgal cultivation continues to intensify, monitoring diseases is important to mitigate potential negative impacts.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Although appreciated for centuries, the identity of position-dependent cues and how they control tissue growth are not resolved. Here, we quantify Erk signaling events in whole populations of osteoblasts during zebrafish fin regeneration. We find that osteoblast Erk activity is dependent on Fgf receptor signaling and organized into millimeter-long gradients that extend from the distal tip to the amputation site. Erk activity scales with the amount of tissue amputated, predicts the likelihood of osteoblast cycling, and predicts the size of regenerated skeletal structures. Mathematical modeling suggests gradients are established by the transient deposition of long-lived ligands that are transported by tissue growth. This concept is supported by the observed scaling of expression of the essential epidermal ligand fgf20a with extents of amputation. Our work provides evidence that localized, scaled expression of pro-regenerative ligands instructs long-range signaling and cycling to control skeletal size in regenerating appendages.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Although proteotoxic stress is well-established in AD, the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in maintaining neuronal proteostasis, and how it becomes compromised during disease progression remains incompletely understood. Here we integrated multiple approaches to characterize proteasome function, composition, and regulation in post-mortem human AD brain tissue compared to age-matched controls. These included proteasome kinetic assays, affinity purification of intact 26S proteasomes, in-gel activity assays and proteomics. According to Braak staging, we further interrogated bulk RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq (sn-RNA-seq) datasets spanning the progression of AD pathology. Finally, we examined Nrf1/NFE2L1 binding and subcellular localization to understand the transcriptional regulation of proteasome genes in AD. We found that proteasome activity is significantly impaired in AD brains, affecting both 26S and 20S complexes. This reduction in proteolytic capacity persisted after proteasome purification, implicating intrinsic defects within the proteasome complex. Proteomic profiling revealed diminished abundances of constitutive proteasome complexes and the co-purification of proteasomes with aggregation-prone substrates (e.g., tau, -synuclein), suggesting proteasome entrapment in pathological aggregates. Transcriptomic analyses showed progressive downregulation of constitutive proteasome subunit genes in individuals along the Braak stage axis, with downregulation apparent even at the earliest Braak stages, in tissue without overt tau aggregation. Neurons were disproportionately affected, whereas non-neuronal cells did not show substantial differences in proteasome-related gene expression, possibly through immunoproteasome induction. Despite elevated NFE2L1 expression, a key transcription factor normally driving proteasome gene transcription, AD brains exhibited impaired Nrf1 nuclear localization, preventing the expected compensatory upregulation of proteasome components. Collectively, our findings suggest that proteasome dysfunction in AD arises early and deepens over the disease course. Intrinsic alterations in proteasome complexes, coupled with early transcriptional downregulation of proteasome subunits and disrupted Nrf1-mediated regulatory pathways, contribute to a vicious cycle of proteotoxic stress and neuronal vulnerability. Restoring proteasome function and enhancing Nrf1-driven transcriptional responses may represent promising therapeutic strategies to preserve proteostasis and mitigate neurodegeneration in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

With the elaboration of large banks of data describing the presence and absence of narrative motifs around the world, scholars have been able to statistically investigate their potential routes and mechanisms of diffusion. However, despite genetic data allowing for increasingly refined demographic movement inferences, few have integrated it into their models, and none at a global scale. In this work, we capitalise on the augmenting availability of modern and ancient genetic data and on a database of more than 2000 mythological motifs worldwide to investigate the mechanisms involved in generating their present-day distribution at a global scale. The direct combination of both kinds of evidence allows us to explore in more depth the respective influences of population movement and replacement versus cultural diffusion on motif transmission. Our results show that both processes have played important roles in shaping their present-day distribution. By leveraging available ancient DNA (aDNA) and deepening the temporal scale of the detected signals, we reveal that correlations between mythemes and genetic patterns can be traced back to population movements that pre-date the Last Glacial Maximum and go back to at least 38,000 years ago, and possibly even earlier to the human expansion out of Africa some 60,000 years ago. Our work shows the earliest evidence for the transmission of stories and storytelling in human history, and supports the joint use of cultural evolutionary theory and population genetics to illuminate the biocultural processes that shaped our species.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Using consensus sequences of immunodominant antigens is a promising antigen design strategy for board cross-protection. Combining these two features, we designed and evaluated a TA mRNA vaccine encoding a consensus spike protein from SARS-CoV-2.

Defects in the migration or differentiation of NCC in the gut can result in gastrointestinal disorders such as Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Although mutations in many genes have been associated with the etiology of HSCR, a significant proportion of affected individuals have an undetermined genetic diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to identify new genes, modifiers and environmental factors that regulate ENS development and disease. Rdh10 catalyzes the first oxidative step in the metabolism of vitamin A to its active metabolite, RA, and is therefore a central regulator of vitamin A metabolism and retinoic acid (RA) synthesis during embryogenesis. We discovered that retinol dehydrogenase 10 (Rdh10) loss-of-function mouse embryos exhibit intestinal aganglionosis, characteristic of HSCR. Vagal NCC form and migrate in Rdh10 mutant embryos but fail to invade the foregut. Rdh10 is highly expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the entrance to the foregut and is essential between E7.5-E9.5 for NCC invasion into the gut. Comparative RNA-sequencing revealed downregulation of the Ret-Gdnf-Gfra1 gene signaling network in Rdh10 mutants, which is critical for vagal NCC chemotaxis. Furthermore, the composition of the extracellular matrix through which NCC migrate is also altered, in part by increased collagen deposition. Collectively this restricts NCC entry into the gut, demonstrating that Rdh10-mediated vitamin A metabolism and RA signaling pleiotropically regulates the NCC microenvironment during ENS formation and in the pathogenesis of intestinal aganglionosis.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Much of the work done on this topic has focused on vascular plants and model organisms. Liverwort biology is very different from that of vascular plants, making generalizations difficult. Here we characterize the microbiome of the liverwort Calasterella californica and explore whether climatic, geographic, and genetic factors are potential drivers of the microbiome composition. Methods: We utilized the genomic data obtained through the California Conservation Genomics Project, which densely sampled individuals of C. californica across California. We selected 34 samples and utilized the MetaPhlAn pipeline to characterize the composition of the microbial communities for each sample. Key results: We characterize the core microbiome of Calasterella, which is dominated by Methylobacterium. There is a weak association between the relative abundance of bacteria in the Hyphomicrobiales and liverwort size. Genetic distance was the most important factor in shaping beta diversity of the Calasterella californica microbiome. Environmental distance was only weakly predictive and geographic distance was not significant. Conclusions: Leveraging genomic data obtained from field samples of a liverwort species allowed us to characterize the microbial diversity of C. californica and its variation across space. There is a group of taxa that are consistently associated with this plant. And the variation observed across samples seems to be linked to the genetic similarity of the liverworts.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Upon mitochondrial perturbation, the ATFS-1-dependent transcriptional program promotes gene expression, leading to mitochondrial recovery. Conversely, atfs-1-deletion worms harbor dysfunctional mitochondria, are developmentally impaired, and short-lived. However, atfs-1-deletion worms develop to adults suggesting the presence of other signaling pathways that promote mitochondrial function and biogenesis in the absence of atfs-1. We hypothesized that additional transcription factors regulate, or promote, mitochondrial function in the absence of atfs-1. Here, we screened for transcription factors that could reduce the decline in mitochondrial function in the atfs-1 mutants when inhibited. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-180 re-establishes a functional mitochondrial network in atfs-1(null) worms, increases mtDNA content, and improves the developmental rate of wildtype worms. NHR-180 increases transcription of genes required for cytosolic protein synthesis in response to mitochondrial perturbation. Inhibition of the S6 kinase homolog, rsks-1, in atfs-1(null) worms leads to a recovery of the mitochondrial network and mtDNA content consistent with nhr-180 regulating expression of protein synthesis components. Consistent with the observations in C. elegans, S6 kinase inhibition also increased mitochondrial biogenesis in mammalian atf5-knockout cells that harbor severely impaired mitochondria. Intriguingly, nhr-180 or S6 kinase inhibition also rescues mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutations in multiple genes required for oxidative phosphorylation. Combined, these studies suggest that increased protein synthesis contributes to the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by perturbations in OXPHOS gene expression and suggest a relatively straightforward approach to reducing the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

We generated 310 gut metagenomes for mother-child pairs from two different locations in Gabon: one rural and one semi-urban. The presence and abundance of four STH parasites (Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, and Necator americanus) were assessed using both microscopy and qPCR. Sequence data were used to characterize the microbiomes and to detect the presence of these four STH parasites. We found that metagenome data could accurately detect the presence of all four STHs, as reflected by high sensitivity and specificity compared to microscopy or qPCR detection. Furthermore, the number of STH species present in stool was associated with microbiome diversity and with the abundances of specific taxa, most notably in young children. We applied this approach to microbiome data from five other populations in Africa and corroborated our findings.

We leveraged two model organisms, Neurospora crassa and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PSTDC3000) to observe immediate fungal responses to bacteria. PSTDC3000 preferentially surrounds N. crassa cells on a solid surface, causing environmental dependent growth responses, bacterial proliferation and varying fungal fitness.

To dissect initial cellular signaling events within the population of germinated asexual spores (germlings), we performed transcriptomics on N. crassa after PSTDC3000 inoculation. Upon contact with live bacteria, a subpopulation of fungal germlings initiate a response as early as ten minutes post-contact revealing transcriptional differentiation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) mechanisms, trace metal warfare, cell wall remodeling dynamics, multidrug-efflux transporters, secondary metabolite synthesis, and excretion.

By symmetry, it also describes the interactions of chirally mirrored proteins with normal D-glycans. Knowledge of cross-chiral recognition is critical to understanding the potential interactions of existing life forms with artificial mirror-life forms, but currently known rules of protein-glycan interaction are insufficient. To build a methodology for learning such interactions, we constructed machine learning models that predict binding strength between proteins and glycans represented as graphs of atoms, rather than monosaccharides. Atomic q-gram and Morgan fingerprint (MF) based representation of glycans made it possible to train ML models that predict lectin binding properties of glycans, glycomimetic compounds, and enantiomers of all natural glycans. Critical to this training was merging disparate data--some with relative fluorescence units (RFU) from glycan microarrays and others with Kd values from ITC--using a universal ""fraction bound"" parameter f at a specific lectin concentration. A fully-connected neural network architecture, MCNet takes a MF and concentration (C) as inputs and returns f for 147 lectins. Performance of MCNet is comparable to the GlyNet models, and by proxy to other state-of-the art models that predict strength of protein-glycan interactions. MCNet effectively predicts binding of glycomimetic compounds to Galectins 1, 3, and 7. Breaking from a monosaccharide-based description makes it possible for MCNet to predict cross-chiral recognition. We employed a Liquid Glycan Array to validate some predictions, such as the lack of interactions of L-mannose with D-mannose binding lectins, purified ConA, and DC-SIGN displayed on cells, and weak binding of L-Man to galactose-binding lectins. MCNets atom-level input makes it possible to agglomerate protein-glycan data from diverse glycans across all kingdoms of life and non-glycan structures (e.g. glycomimetic compounds). The universal fraction bound parameter makes it possible to unify disparate quantitative observations (Kd/IC50, RFU, chromatographic retention times, etc.). We believe that such an approach will facilitate a merger of knowledge from diverse glycobiology datasets and predict protein interactions with uncommon/unnatural glycans not attainable from current ML models.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

However, existing full-length single-cell RNA-sequencing methods suffer from multiple technical limitations, such as the pervasive presence of reverse transcription artifacts across genes. Here, we introduce Ouro-Seq, a novel single-cell long-read sequencing framework with a versatile artifact removal mechanism for characterizing full-length mRNA species expressed by individual cells. We also developed a computational pipeline that identifies genuine full-length cDNAs and normalizes full-length mRNA size distributions for integration. Using Ouro-Seq, we constructed the Mouse Single-Cell Long-Read Splicing Atlas by collecting full-length transcriptomes of 103,304 nuclei or cells from 12 major organs and tissues of adult mice. Our atlas comprehensively characterizes alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative polyadenylation events across cell types, revealing previously unappreciated functional heterogeneity among individual cells. Different cell types exhibit largely distinct expression patterns of various isoforms, corresponding to their specific morphologies and biological functions. Our splicing atlas and generalized long-read frameworks will empower researchers to fully interpret biological variation across full-length transcriptomes of single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Iteratively Defined Lengths of Inaccessibility (IDLI) classifies nucleosomes on the basis of shared patterns of intranucleosomal accessibility, into: i.) minimally-accessible chromatosomes; ii.) octasomes with stereotyped DNA accessibility from superhelical locations (SHLs) {+/-}1 through {+/-}7; iii.) highly-accessible unwrapped nucleosomes; and iv.) subnucleosomal species, such as hexasomes, tetrasomes, and other short DNA protections. Applying IDLI to mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) chromatin, we discover widespread nucleosomal distortion on individual mammalian chromatin fibers, with >85% of nucleosomes surveyed displaying degrees of intranucleosomally accessible DNA. We observe epigenomic-domain-specific patterns of distorted nucleosome co-occupancy and positioning, including at enhancers, promoters, and mouse satellite repeat sequences. Nucleosome distortion is programmed by the presence of bound transcription factors (TFs) at cognate motifs; occupied TF binding sites are differentially decorated by distorted nucleosomes compared to unbound sites, and degradation experiments establish direct roles for TFs in structuring binding-site proximal nucleosomes. Finally, we apply IDLI in the context of primary mouse hepatocytes, observing evidence for pervasive nucleosomal distortion in vivo. Further genetic experiments reveal a role for the hepatocyte master regulator FOXA2 in directly impacting nucleosome distortion at hepatocyte-specific regulatory elements in vivo. Our work suggests extreme--but regulated--plasticity in nucleosomal DNA accessibility at the single-molecule level. Further, our study offers an essential new framework to model transcription factor binding, nucleosome remodeling, and cell-type specific gene regulation across biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

The structure and interaction networks of molecules within condensates remain poorly understood. Using cryo-electron tomography and molecular dynamics simulations we elucidated the structure of phase separated chromatin condensates across scales, from individual amino acids to network architecture. We found that internucleosomal DNA linker length controls nucleosome arrangement and histone tail interactions, shaping the structure of individual chromatin molecules both within and outside condensates. This structural modulation determines the balance between intra- and intermolecular interactions, which in turn governs the molecular network, thermodynamic stability, and material properties of chromatin condensates. Mammalian nuclei contain dense clusters of nucleosomes whose non-random organization is mirrored by the reconstituted condensates. Our work explains how the structure of individual chromatin molecules ultimately determines physical properties of chromatin condensates, with implications for cellular chromatin organization.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

By combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological programs or direct effects on the trait.

Moreover, diverging neuronal population trajectory dynamics and enhanced antagonistic sub-ensemble representation of threat-related behaviors, and enhanced threat-related location representation, were also observed. Lastly, cannabinoid administration increased the proportion of SOM neurons exhibiting multidimensional representation of threat-related behaviors and behavior-location conjunction. While cannabinoid receptor activation ex vivo suppressed excitatory inputs to SOM neurons, our data suggest preferential suppression of local GABA release subserves cannabinoid activation of CeA SOM neurons.

Despite existing research, it remains unclear how the gut microbiome is affected by different intensities of PA, and how other lifestyle factors influence this relationship. Here we study the relation between PA intensity and gut microbiome composition and function in a large Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project dataset.

MethodsA cross-sectional design was performed on 5409 adults aged 40 to 60 from the community-based Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project and from all these participants metagenomic shotgun data was available. Participants were categorized into sedentary (N=2501), moderate (N=1915), and vigorous (N=993) PA groups, based on self-reported activity levels. We investigated association between PA intensity and microbial diversity, bacterial species, and metabolic pathways by multiple regression models sequentially adjusted for the covariates age/sex, BMI, stool consistency and diet quality/alcohol intake.

ResultsVigorous PA, but not moderate PA, was significantly associated with higher gut microbiome alpha diversity (i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) as compared to sedentary PA. Compared to the sedentary group, the vigorous PA group showed a lower abundance of the bacterial species Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus ({beta} = -0.003, p = 0.042), even after extensive covariate adjustments and correction for multiple testing. Other species were initially also significantly associated with vigorous PA, but they disappeared after adjusting for covariates resulting in a loss of significance. Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of two distinct metabolic pathways related to cellular energy recycling (Pyruvate fermentation to acetate and lactate II, {beta} = 8.11x10-05, p = 0.035) and purine metabolism (Purine ribonucleosides degradation, {beta} = 3.36x10-04, p = 0.039) in participants engaging in vigorous PA as compared to sedentary PA.

ConclusionsVigorous PA is associated with higher gut microbiome diversity and with specific alterations of microbial composition. The lower abundance of Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus within the vigorous PA group may be linked to increased gut permeability. The identified enrichment of microbial fermentation and purine metabolism in vigorous PA hints at a potential role of PA in affecting gut microbiome functionality and host health. The results of our modeling strategy highlight the importance of adjusting for dietary covariates to understand how PA may impact the gut microbiome independently from other influences.","NA","medrxiv",1737842956042

In recent years, many small molecule inhibitors against these channels have been developed. The recent successful clinical trial of VX-548, a NaV1.8-selective inhibitor, has spurred much interest in expanding the arsenal of subtype-selective voltage-gated sodium channel therapeutics. Toward that end, we sought to determine whether NaVs are amenable to targeted protein degradation with small molecule degraders, namely proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glues. Here, we report that degron-tagged NaVs are potently and rapidly degraded by small molecule degraders harnessing the E3 ubiquitin ligases cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel Lindau (VHL). Using LC/MS analysis, we demonstrate that PROTAC-mediated proximity between NaV1.8 and CRBN results in ubiquitination on the 2nd intracellular loop, pointing toward a potential mechanism of action and demonstrating the ability of CRBN to recognize a VGSC as a neosubstrate. Our foundational findings are an important first step toward realizing the immense potential of NaV-targeting degrader analgesics to combat chronic pain.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Complete anaerobic SQ degradation via interspecies metabolite transfer to sulfonate-respiring bacteria produces hydrogen sulfide, which has dose- and context-dependent health effects. Here, we studied potential SQ degradation by the mammalian host and the impact of SQ supplementation on human and murine gut microbiota diversity and metabolism. 13CO2 breath tests with germ-free C57BL/6 mice gavaged with 13C-SQ were negative. Also, SQ was not degraded by human intestinal cells in vitro, indicating that SQ is not directly metabolized by mice and humans. Addition of increasing SQ concentrations to human fecal microcosms revealed dose-dependent responses of the microbiota and corroborated the relevance of Agathobacter rectalis and Bilophila wadsworthia in cooperative degradation of SQ to hydrogen sulfide via interspecies transfer of 2,3-dihydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (DHPS). Similar to the human gut microbiome, the genetic capacity for SQ or DHPS degradation is sparsely distributed among bacterial species in the mouse gut. Escherichia coli and Enterocloster clostridioformis were identified as primary SQ degraders in the mouse gut. SQ and DHPS supplementation experiments with conventional laboratory mice and their intestinal contents showed that SQ was incompletely catabolized to DHPS. Although some E. clostridioformis genomes encode an extended sulfoglycolytic pathway for both SQ and DHPS fermentation, SQ was only degraded to DHPS by a mouse-derived E. clostridioformis strain. Our findings suggest that SQ is solely a nutrient for the gut microbiota and not for mice and humans, emphasizing its potential as a prebiotic. SQ degradation by the mouse microbiota differs from the human gut microbiota by absence of DHPS degradation activity. Hence, the microbiota of conventional laboratory mice does not fully represent the SQ metabolism in humans, indicating the need for alternative model systems to assess the impact of SQ on human health. This study advances our understanding of how individual dietary compounds shape the microbial community structure and metabolism in the gut and thereby potentially influence host health.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

Stomata serve as gatekeepers on plant leaves, regulating both CO2 capture for photosynthesis and the concomitant release of water. At higher CO2 concentrations or higher vapour pressure deficit (VPD), stomatal pores narrow, reducing stomatal conductance to water vapour (gsw) and transpiration (E)2-6. Increasing temperatures and/or nitrogen fertilisation promote an opposite stomatal response, enhancing gsw and E7,8. With atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature and VPD predicted to rise throughout this century1, it is unclear how crops will modify stomatal gaseous exchanges, particularly under differing N-fertilisation regimes. Here, we show in wheat (Triticum aestivum), that elevated CO2 does not reduce gsw or E during heatwaves when VPD is high, instead plant water usage increases. High-VPD heatwave events also impact stomatal responsiveness to N-fertiliser application, prompting significantly higher gas exchange contributions from abaxial leaf surfaces, irrespective of CO2 growth conditions. Dynamic stomatal responsiveness to light and high CO2 are also attenuated during heatwaves in a CO2-independent manner. Taken together, our data suggests that future wheat crops will use significantly more water during heatwaves than might be expected, which has substantial implications for future global food security.","NA","biorxiv",1737842956042

The highly repetitive and transcribed nature of the rRNA genes (rDNA) by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) poses a challenge for DNA repair and replication machineries. Here, we profile the nucleolar proteome and the chromatin landscape of stalled replication sites upon rDNA damage to characterize the early steps of nucleolar DNA damage response (nDDR). We observed early dynamics in nucleolar-nucleoplasmic proteome localization and identified nucleolar replication stress signatures involving chromatin remodeling networks, transcription-replication conflicts and DNA repair. Our findings define localized surveillance mechanisms that activate the nDDR. Further, we identified that upon rDNA damage, nucleolar RNA Polymerase (Pol) II binds to intergenic rDNA sequences and generates R-loops (DNA:RNA hybrid structures) that are essential for recruiting nDDR factors. Using a boutique CRISPR-Cas9 synthetic lethal screen of DNA repair factors with inhibitors of RNA Pol I transcription, we identified an unexpected protective role for the DNA translocase RAD54L in nDDR. Loss of Rad54L increases nucleolar R-loops and rDNA damage leading to defects in nucleolar structure and enhanced sensitivity to PARP and RNA Pol I inhibitors. Altogether, our study uncovers localized surveillance networks within the nucleolus that respond to rDNA damage.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1737842956042

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737842956042
