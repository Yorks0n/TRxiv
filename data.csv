Like pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) can be recognized by cell surface pattern recognition receptors leading to defensive transcriptional changes in host plants. Herbivore-induced defensive outputs are regulated by the circadian clock, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate how the plant circadian clock regulates transcriptional reprogramming of a specific HAMP-induced pathway, we characterized the daytime and nighttime transcriptional response to caterpillar-derived In11 peptide, in the legume crop cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Using diurnal and free-running conditions, we found that daytime In11 elicitation resulted in stronger late-induced gene expression than nighttime. Plants with a conditional arrhythmic phenotype in constant light (LL) conditions lost time-of-day dependent responses to In11 treatment, and this was associated with arrhythmic expression of circadian clock core transcription factor Late Elongated Hypocotyl VuLHY1 and VuLHY2. Reporter assays with VuLHY homologs indicated that they interact with the promoter of daytime In11-induced Kunitz Trypsin Inhibitor (VuKTI) via a canonical and a polymorphic CCA1/LHY Binding Site (CBS), consistent with a mechanism of direct regulation by circadian clock transcription factors. This study improves our understanding of the time-dependent mechanisms that regulate herbivore-induced gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

While the immune system is known to regulate tissue damage, immune mechanisms involved in RT-induced intestinal toxicity are not fully understood. CT-guided localised intestinal irradiation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry revealed RT-induced chemokine-dependent recruitment of immune cells. Deletion of C-C chemokine receptor (Ccr)1, Ccr2, Ccr3 and Ccr5, blocked recruitment and worsened radiation induced toxicities. Furthermore, CCR2-deficient mice showed exacerbated weight loss and intestinal permeability, while the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes alleviated symptoms. Mechanistically, IL-17 cytokine production by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), a critical factor in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, was reduced in irradiated CCR2-/-, however the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes resulted in increased IL-17 levels. These findings demonstrate the critical importance of CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment in mitigating RT-induced toxicities.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

This repeated cross-sectional study aimed to explore the long-term health and cognitive effects of COVID-19, focusing on how virus variants, vaccination, illness severity, and time since infection impact post-COVID-19 outcomes. We examined three cohorts of university students (N=584) and used non-parametric methods to assess correlations of various health and cognitive variables with SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, vaccination status, time since infection, time since vaccination, and virus variants. Our results show that some health and cognitive impairments persist, with some even progressively worsening especially fatigue in women and memory in men, up to four years post-infection, with the Wuhan variant having the most significant long-term impact and the Omicron variant the least. Interestingly, the severity of the acute illness was not correlated with the variant of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis also revealed that individuals who contracted COVID-19 after vaccination had better health and cognitive outcomes compared to those infected before vaccination. The study also discusses some limitations inherent in cross-sectional studies, particularly those arising from the stronger tendency of individuals with poorer health, compared to healthier individuals, to avoid infection and prioritize vaccination. To mitigate potential bias, the study proposes focusing on factors such as illness severity and time since infection or vaccination when analyzing persistent symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1731276527383

To understand the seeming paradox of how sequence variability is compatible with persistent function, we examined the functional determinants for a poorly conserved but essential IDR. We show that IDR function depends on two distinct but related properties: sequence- and chemical specificity. While sequence-specificity works via linear binding motifs, chemical specificity reflects the sequence-encoded chemistry of multivalent interactions through amino acids across an IDR. Unexpectedly, a binding motif that is essential in the wild-type IDR can be removed if compensatory changes to the sequence chemistry are made, highlighting the orthogonality and interoperability of both properties and providing a much deeper sequence space compatible with function. Our results provide a general framework to understand the functional constraints on IDR sequence evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

We have analyzed lung-draining lymph nodes (LD-LNs) from COVID-19 autopsies using multiplex imaging and spatial transcriptomics to examine the immune landscape and with respect to the aging. We identified three subgroups of Reactive Follicles (RFs) based on Bcl6 prevalence, RF-Bcl6no/low, RF-Bcl6int and RF-Bcl6high. RF-Bcl6high tissues express a distinct B/TFH immune landscape associated with increased prevalence of proliferating B- and TFH-cell subsets. Comparison between LD-LNs and matched subdiaphragmatic LNs revealed a disconnected Bcl6 reactivity between the two anatomical sites. LD-LNs Bcl6 reactivity was associated with a distinct spatial transcriptomic profile. TH1-associated genes/pathways (e.g. CXCR3, STAT5, TNF signaling) were significantly upregulated in RF-Bcl6no/low tissues while the RF-Bcl6high tissues exhibited significant upregulation of GC-promoting genes/pathways (e.g. CXCL13, B cell receptor signaling). Despite the similar prevalence, the in-situ transcriptome profiling indicates a higher monocyte/macrophage functionality in ""Aged"" compared to ""Young"" follicles from donors with comparable Bcl6 reactivity. Our findings reveal a heterogeneous F/GC landscape in COVID-19 LD-LNs and highlight specific molecular targets and pathways that could regulate human F/GC immune dynamics during early viral infections.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these highly complex conditions remains limited. To gain deeper insights into the etiology of different brain diseases, we used specimens from 1,494 unique donors to generate a population-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), comprising over 6.3 million individual nuclei. The cohort includes neurotypical controls as well as donors affected by eight common and complex brain disorders: Alzheimers disease (AD), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), vascular dementia (Vas), Parkinsons disease (PD), tauopathy, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We show that inter-individual variation accounts for a substantial portion of gene expression variation in the DLPFC. By comparing transcriptomic variation across diseases, we reveal universal signatures enriched in basic cellular functions such as mRNA splicing and protein localization. After discounting these cross-disease signatures, we show strong genetic and transcriptomic concordance among AD, DLBD, Vas, and PD, largely driven by alteration of synaptic signaling functions in neurons. Furthermore, we characterize transcriptomic variation among different AD phenotypes that were distinct from healthy aging. We uncover mitigating effects of interneurons and aggravating effects of immune and vascular cells in AD dementia. Further exploring the effect of the neuropsychiatric symptoms frequently accompanying AD, we identify a link to deep layer excitatory neurons. By constructing transcriptome trajectories that capture AD progression, we show cell-type specific responses implicated in early and late stages of AD. Our atlas provides an unprecedented perspective of the transcriptomic landscape in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, shedding light on shared and distinct processes involving the neuro-immune-vascular systems, and identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","NA","medrxiv",1731276527383

The mechanisms imposing a different crossover landscape in female and male meiosis remain elusive. Here, we simultaneously disrupted multiple anti-crossover mechanisms in Arabidopsis and analyzed the whole genome sequence of thousands of female- and male-derived progenies. The largest crossover increase was reached in zyp1 recq4, with 12-fold in females and a 4.5-fold increase in males. Despite this unprecedented level of crossovers, fertility is marginally affected, opening new possibilities for plant breeding. Manipulating additional crossover regulators in zyp1 recq4 did not further elevate the frequency of crossovers, but modified the relative contributions of the two known crossover pathways. This suggests an upper limit was reached and the two pathways compete for a large but limited set of recombination intermediates. Remarkably, while wild-type crossover distribution differs markedly between sexes, the crossover landscapes of diverse mutants in both females and males converge to a single novel profile, which we termed Crossover Potential (COP). The COP profile, which we defined using 49,482 crossovers, can be accurately predicted using only sequence divergence and chromatin features. We propose that the COP represents the density of eligible recombination precursors, which is determined by genomic features and is thus identical in females and males. It suggests that the sexual dimorphism in the crossover landscape results exclusively from differential regulation of the likeness of precursors to mature into crossovers.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

We discovered that murine astrovirus, an enteric RNA virus, persists indefinitely when mice remain unperturbed but is cleared rapidly after cage change. Besides eliminating the external viral reservoir, cage change also induced a transcriptional defense response in the intestinal epithelium. We further identified that displacing infected animals initially caused a temporary period of immune suppression through the stress hormone corticosterone, which was followed by an immune rebound characterized by an increase in CD8 T cells responsible for the epithelial antiviral responses. Our findings show how viral persistence can be disrupted by preventing re-exposure and activating immunity upon stress recovery, indicating that external factors can be manipulated to shorten the duration of a viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha propagates clonally through vegetative gemmae or via sexually generated spores, but our understanding of the genetic pathways underpinning reproductive decision-making is limited. GRAS transcriptional regulators are highly conserved proteins across land plants, with diverse functionality in stress and development. Here, we discover a central role for the SCLA-type transcription regulator MpGRAS7 in both stress signalling and reproduction in Marchantia. MpGRAS7 is highly expressed in gemma cups and gametangiophores and is activated in response to Far Red (FR) light and abscisic acid (ABA) environmental cues. Genetic dissection further suggests MpGRAS7 is required to maintain gemma dormancy, gemma cup frequency, and FR-induced gametangiophore development. The sequence conservation and expression patterns of MpGRAS7 orthologs in flowering plants hints towards the broader function of SCLA-type GRAS proteins in stress-regulated developmental transitions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today.

Here we assess the ability of protein language models (PLMs), routinely applied to protein folding, to be retrained for PPI prediction. Existing PPI prediction models that exploit PLMs use a pre-trained PLM feature set, ignoring that the proteins are physically interacting. Our novel method, PLM-interact, goes beyond a single protein, jointly encoding protein pairs to learn their relationships, analogous to the next-sentence prediction task from natural language processing. This approach provides a significant improvement in performance: Trained on human-human PPIs, PLM-interact predicts mouse, fly, worm, E. coli and yeast PPIs, achieving between 16-28% improvements in AUPR compared with state-of-the-art PPI models. Additionally, it can detect changes that disrupt or cause PPIs and be applied to virus-host PPI prediction. Our work demonstrates that large language models can be extended to learn the intricate relationships among biomolecules from sequences alone.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria. Finally, we evaluated the use of G-Ca-FLITS and its turquoise predecessor for two-photon FLIM in Drosophila brains.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

In contrast to the extensive morphological and molecular characterization of sensory neurons, there has been little description of the cells that control ion concentrations in the zebrafish olfactory system. Here, we report the molecular and ultrastructural characterization of zebrafish olfactory ionocytes. Transcriptome analysis suggests that the zebrafish olfactory epithelium contains at least three different ionocyte types, which resemble Na+/K+-ATPase-rich (NaR), Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC), and H+-ATPase-rich (HR) cells, responsible for calcium, chloride, and pH regulation, respectively, in the zebrafish skin. NaR-like and HR-like ionocytes are usually adjacent to one another, whereas NCC-like cells are usually solitary. The distinct subtypes are differentially distributed: NaR-like/HR-like cell pairs are found broadly within the olfactory epithelium, whereas NCC-like cells reside within the peripheral non-sensory multiciliated cell zone. Comparison of gene expression and serial-section electron microscopy analysis indicates that the NaR-like cells wrap around the HR-like cells and are connected to them by shallow tight junctions. The development of olfactory ionocyte subtypes is also differentially regulated, as pharmacological Notch inhibition leads to a loss of NaR-like and HR-like cells, but does not affect NCC-like ionocyte number. These results provide a molecular and anatomical characterization of olfactory ionocytes in a stenohaline freshwater teleost. The paired ionocytes suggest that both transcellular and paracellular transport regulate ion concentrations in the olfactory epithelium, while the solitary ionocytes may enable independent regulation of multiciliated cells.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

The potential role of age-associated dysbiosis on disease outcomes is still elusive. In the current study, we used high-resolution shotgun metagenomics and targeted metabolomics to characterize SARS-CoV-2-associated changes in the gut microbiota from young (2-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) hamsters, a valuable model of COVID-19. We show that age-related dysfunctions in the gut microbiota are linked to disease severity and long-term sequelae in older hamsters. Our data also reveal age-specific changes in the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota during both the acute phase (day 7 post-infection, D7) and the recovery phase (D22) of infection. Aged hamsters exhibited the most notable shifts in gut microbiota composition and plasma metabolic profiles. Through an integrative analysis of metagenomics, metabolomics, and clinical data, we identified significant associations between bacterial taxa, metabolites and disease markers in the aged group. On D7 (high viral load and lung epithelial damage) and D22 (body weight loss and fibrosis), numerous amino acids, amino acid-related molecules, and indole derivatives were found to correlate with disease markers. In particular, a persistent decrease in phenylalanine, tryptophan, glutamic acid, and indoleacetic acid in aged animals positively correlated with poor recovery of body weight and/or lung fibrosis by D22. In younger hamsters, several bacterial taxa (Eubacterium, Oscillospiraceae, Lawsonibacter) and plasma metabolites (carnosine and cis-aconitic acid) were associated with mild disease outcomes. These findings support the need for age-specific microbiome-targeting strategies to more effectively manage acute viral pneumonia and long-term disease outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Recently, protein phase separation has been observed at cellular membranes, suggesting it may play a role in the assembly of protein complexes. Inspired by these findings, we observed that protein condensates on one side of a planar suspended membrane spontaneously colocalized with those on the opposite side. How might this phenomenon contribute to the assembly of stable transmembrane complexes? To address this question, we examined the diffusion and growth of protein condensates on both sides of membranes. Our results reveal that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates on opposite sides of the membrane slows down condensate diffusion while accelerating condensate growth. How can the rate of condensate growth increase simultaneously with a decrease in the rate of condensate diffusion? We provide insights into these seemingly contradictory observations by distinguishing between diffusion-limited and coupling-driven growth processes. While transmembrane coupling slows down diffusion, it also locally concentrates condensates within a confined area. This confinement increases the probability of condensate coalescence and thereby enhances the overall rate of growth for coupled condensates, substantially surpassing the growth rate for uncoupled condensates. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling could play a role in the assembly of diverse membrane-bound structures by promoting the localization and growth of protein complexes on both membrane surfaces. This phenomenon could help to explain the efficient assembly of transmembrane structures in diverse cellular contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Human brain regions develop at different rates, with many regions developing into the third and fourth decades of life.

Using task-based (i.e., attention to-be-remembered visual stimuli) and task-free (resting-state) data from 101 children and adults (5.93 - 54.00 years, 63 males; n electrodes = 5691), we mapped aperiodic (1/f-like) activity, a proxy of excitation:inhibition (E:I) balance with steeper slopes indexing inhibition and flatter slopes indexing excitation. We reveal that aperiodic slopes flatten with age into young adulthood in both association and sensorimotor cortices, challenging models of early sensorimotor development based on brain structure. In prefrontal cortex (PFC), attentional state modulated age effects, revealing steeper task-based than task-free slopes in adults and the opposite in children, consistent with the development of cognitive control. Age-related differences in task-based slopes also explained age-related gains in memory performance, linking the development of PFC cognitive control to the development of memory. Last, with additional structural imaging measures, we reveal that age-related differences in gray matter volume are differentially associated with aperiodic slopes in association and sensorimotor cortices. Our findings establish developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity in localized brain regions and illuminate the development of PFC inhibitory control during adolescence in the development of attention and memory.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

A subset of sequenced SAR11 genomes, predominantly in the brackish and freshwater SAR11 subclades, contain homologs of pha genes, which in other organisms confer the ability to store carbon and energy via polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymers. Here, we investigated the relevance of PHA production to SAR11 biology. Phylogenetics showed that Pha proteins occurred on a long branch and provided evidence for origin at the common ancestor of the brackish IIIa and freshwater LD12 subclades, followed by horizontal transfer within SAR11. Using the LD12 representative ""Candidatus Fonsibacter ubiquis"" strain LSUCC0530, we found that a large minority of LSUCC0530 cells contained a single Nile red-staining granule, confirmed that the cells produced polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and estimated the total PHB content in the cells. We heterologously expressed the LSUCC0530 phaCAB locus in Escherichia coli, finding it to be functional and the likely origin of the PHB. We also determined that, irrespective of changes to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations, a similar fraction of LSUCC0530 cells generated PHB granules and expression of the phaCAB locus remained constant. We suggest that PHB synthesis in LSUCC0530 may be constitutively active due to the slow growth dynamics and minimal regulation that characterize SAR11 bacteria. This is the first characterization of polymer storage in SAR11, providing new insights into the likely fitness advantage for cells harboring this metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Streptococci are common in animal microbiota and include opportunistic pathogens like Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). While the conserved streptococcal S protein has been identified as a key factor in GAS virulence, its exact function is unclear. Here, we show that the pneumococcal S protein is crucial for resisting against host-derived antimicrobials by coordinating cell wall modification and repair. Specifically, we show that S proteins are septally localized through their transmembrane domain and contain an extracellular peptidoglycan (PG) binding LysM domain which is required for its function. Protein-protein and genetic interaction studies demonstrate that the pneumococcal S protein directly interacts with a PG synthase, class A penicillin binding protein PBP1a, and the PG deacetylase PgdA. Single-molecule experiments reveal that the fraction of circumferentially moving PBP1a molecules is reduced in the absence of S protein. Consistent with an impaired PBP1a function, streptococci lacking S protein exhibit increased susceptibility to cell wall targeting antibiotics and altered cell morphologies. PG analysis showed reduced N-deacetylation of glycans in the S. pneumoniae S protein mutant, indicating reduced PgdA activity. We show that pneumococci lacking the S protein cannot persist transient penicillin treatment, are more susceptible to the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and to lysozyme, and show decreased virulence in zebrafish and mice.

Traditionally, studies have focused on the role of contemporary ecology--such as pollinator or mate availability--in driving spatial patterns in reproductive assurance within species, however, historical processes such as post-glacial range expansion may be an understudied alternative explanation for geographic variation in mating system. This is because during the process of geographic range expansion into novel habitat, selection should favour individuals that possess traits promoting reproductive assurance (i.e., autonomous selfing or clonal reproduction). Here, we used Northern pink monkeyflower--Erythranthe (Mimulus lewisii--a hermaphroditic, self-compatible, perennial, alpine plant, as a focal species to investigate the historical signatures of geographic range expansion by combining phylogeographic analyses with a greenhouse survey of range-wide reproductive assurance. First, we detected significant geographic variation among populations in two components of reproductive assurance: self-fertilization and clonal propagation. Next, using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, we identified three distinct genetic clusters structured by longitude and estimated geographic coordinates of the most likely origins of range expansion within each cluster. We found that both measures of reproductive assurance significantly increased on average with distance from the inferred biogeographic origin, which is consistent with the hypothesis that reproductive assurance undergoes adaptive evolution during range expansion. This study supports hypotheses underlying Baker's Law and contributes to our understanding of spatial variation in reproductive assurance, which is linked to variation in evolutionary potential, adaptability, and the long-term persistence of populations across large spatial scales.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

These predictions are related to dispersal limitation at the leading edge driving colonization dynamics, a scenario common in post-glacial range expansion at the continental scale ([~]20,000 years ago). However, post-glacial range expansion can also occur on contemporary time scales, such as alpine glacier recession following the end of The Little Ice Age ([~]150 years ago) and our understanding of dispersal limitation structuring these instances of rapid range expansion are relatively understudied. Here, we test whether there is evidence supporting the role of dispersal limitation during range expansion following alpine glacier retreat using the native alpine plant Erythranthe (Mimulus) lewisii by examining patterns of neutral genetic diversity (single nucleotide polymorphisms) across the history of glacier recession (i.e., glacier chronosequence) across two glacier forelands in Garibaldi Provincial Park, BC. We find weak support for the prediction of increasing clines in genetic differentiation towards the range edge, and no support for decreasing clines in genetic diversity, suggesting dispersal limitation is not characterizing colonization during range expansion, with the implication that the accumulation of expansion load at the range edge is likely not applicable on these spatiotemporal scales. Together, our results suggest that loss of genetic diversity for range-shifting species in the alpine is likely not a key contributing factor to any decreased fitness over time.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Although rhodopsins generally harbor retinal as their only chromophore, a recent study reported that carotenoid antennae transfer light energy to the retinal in proteorhodopsins, proton pump rhodopsins abundant in marine environments. Here, using marine bacterial isolates, we detected energy transfer from a carotenoid (myxol) to retinal not only in proteorhodopsin but also in the chloride ion-pumping rhodopsin. Carotenoid binding improved the light utilization efficiency of the proteorhodopsin by accelerating the photocycle, together with facilitating light-harvesting. The carotenoid-binding ability is conserved in rhodopsins of the phylum Bacteroidota, which are widely transcribed in the photic zone. These findings suggest that the distribution of carotenoid-binding rhodopsins is more taxon-specific than previously thought, thus underscoring the importance of carotenoid-binding rhodopsins that provide an extended light utilization strategy in the environmental adaptation of marine bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

A subset of people with LC present with symptoms resembling those of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The objective of this study was to compare cortisol concentrations in those with and without Long COVID, with a particular focus on people experiencing ME/CFS-like Long COVID. METHODS: We measured plasma cortisol in 200 individuals 3-6 months following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Banked biospecimens collected between 8 AM-12 PM were used. Participants met the case definition for Long COVID if they had >=1 COVID-attributed symptom at least 3 months after symptom onset. People who did not report any symptoms at least 3 months after symptom onset served as recovered controls. Adapting the 2015 Institute of Medicine criteria for ME/CFS, we further defined those with LC resembling ME/CFS (LC-ME). RESULTS: We found no difference in overall morning cortisol concentrations between people with LC (n=144) and those who fully recovered (n=56) (median 8.9 g/dL vs. 8.8 g/dL, p=0.97). Analyses of samples collected between 8-10 AM, however, revealed that, compared to those who fully recovered, cortisol concentrations were lower between 8-9 AM for those with LC-ME (median 8.2 vs. 14.8, p=0.02), but higher between 9-10 AM for those with severe LC (>=5 symptoms) (median 12.4 vs. 8.5, p=0.009) and those with LC-ME (median 13.7 vs. 8.5, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: We found no difference in overall morning plasma cortisol concentrations between those with and without Long COVID. Although our data could be suggestive of altered morning cortisol dynamics in a subset of people with Long COVID, longitudinal measures of cortisol in individuals with Long COVID will be critical to further inform the biology of the condition.","NA","medrxiv",1731276527383

Previous research employing functional MRI (fMRI) in humans has identified cortical organizing principles that allow not only for coarse-scale distinctions such as animate versus inanimate objects but also more fine-grained distinctions at the level of individual objects. This suggests that fMRI carries rather fine-grained information about individual objects. However, most previous work investigating fine-grained category representations either additionally included coarse-scale category comparisons of objects, which confounds fine-grained and coarse-scale distinctions, or only used a single exemplar of each object, which confounds visual and semantic information. To address these challenges, here we used multisession human fMRI (female and male) paired with a broad yet homogenous stimulus class of 48 terrestrial mammals, with 2 exemplars per mammal. Multivariate decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed high image-specific reliability in low- and high-level visual regions, indicating stable representational patterns at the image level. In contrast, analyses across exemplars of the same animal yielded only small effects in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), indicating rather subtle category effects in this region. Variance partitioning with a deep neural network and shape model showed that across exemplar effects in EVC were largely explained by low-level visual appearance, while representations in LOC appeared to also contain higher category-specific information. These results suggest that representations typically measured with fMRI are dominated by image-specific visual or coarse-grained category information but indicate that commonly employed fMRI protocols may reveal subtle yet reliable distinctions between individual objects.

Significance StatementWhile it has been suggested that functional MRI (fMRI) responses in ventral visual cortex carry fine-grained information about individual objects, much previous research has confounded fine-grained with coarse-scale category information or only used individual visual exemplars, which potentially confounds semantic and visual object information. Here we address these challenges in a multisession fMRI study where participants viewed a highly homogenous stimulus set of 48 land mammals with 2 exemplars per animal. Our results reveal a strong dominance of image-specific effects and additionally indicate subtle yet reliable category-specific effects in lateral occipital complex, underscoring the capacity of commonly employed fMRI protocols to uncover fine-grained visual information.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Understanding the molecular basis of such diseases has long been challenging, owing to a lack of models accurately reflecting disease genotypes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we develop and characterize in vitro human cartilage derived from wild-type and disease-causing Arg719Cys COL2A1 isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Methods Using directed differentiation of iPSCs to chondrocytes, we generated cartilage from wild-type and Arg719Cys COL2A1 lines. We compared the resulting protein, cell, and tissue properties using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, RNA-sequencing, and quantitative interactomics. Results While both wild-type and disease lines deposited a cartilage matrix, the Arg719Cys matrix was deficient. Arg719Cys collagen-II was excessively post-translationally modified and modestly intracellularly retained, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) distention suggestive of an ER storage defect. Interactomic studies indicated that Arg719Cys procollagen-II was not differentially engaged by the ER proteostasis network. RNA-sequencing showed that the ER storage defect engendered by Arg719Cys procollagen-II also did not activate cellular stress responses, including the unfolded protein response. These data suggest that cells fail to properly recognize Arg719Cys-associated procollagen-II defects. Conclusions A failure to identify and rectify defective procollagen-II folding in cells expressing Arg719Cys procollagen-II leads to the deposition of a sparse and defective collagen-II matrix, culminating in pathology. Combined with the highly expandable human cartilage disease model reported here, this work provides motivation and a platform to discover therapeutic strategies targeting procollagen folding, quality control, and secretion in this collagenopathy and others.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

To determine the molecular mechanisms of species- and tissue-specificity for homologous TBPs, we examined the ability of yeast TBP and murine TBP paralogs to replace the endogenous TBP in mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that, despite the high conservation in the DNA binding domain among the homologs, they cannot fully rescue the lethality of TBP depletion in mESCs, largely due to their inability to support RNA Pol III transcription. Furthermore, we show that the homologs differentially support stress-induced transcription reprogramming, with the divergent N-terminal domain playing a role in modulating changes in transcriptional response. Lastly, we show that the homologs have vastly different DNA binding dynamics, suggesting a potential mechanism for the distinct functional behavior observed among the homologs. Taken together, these data show a remarkable balance between flexibility and essentiality for the different functions of homologous TBP in eukaryotic transcription.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Computational analyses separated the principal and accessory members in chicken and lizard, identifying molecular signatures distinguishing either member from single cones and rods in the same species. Comparative transcriptomic analyses suggest that both the principal and accessory originated from ancestral red cones. Furthermore, the gene expression variation among cone subtypes mirrors their spectral order (red [-&gt;] green [-&gt;] blue [-&gt;] UV), suggesting a constraint in their order of emergence during evolution.

However, the effects of drugs targeting human pathways on fungal cells, and whether they influence antifungal drug responses, are poorly understood. Methods We systematically analyzed clinical guidelines to shortlist non-antifungal drugs commonly used in conditions that increase the likelihood of fungal infections. Focusing on the most prevalent fungal pathogen, we then tested how these drugs affected the antifungal response of Candida albicans to two commonly used antifungals, fluconazole and anidulafungin. Drug interactions identified were further assessed using checkerboard and disk diffusion assays. Finally, antifungal treatment efficacy of fluconazole in combination with negatively interaction drugs was evaluated in an in vivo Galleria mellonella model of disseminated C. albicans infection. Findings Out of 119 drugs frequently co-administered with antifungals in 40 conditions associated with a high risk of fungal infections, 34 compounds affected the antifungal drug response in C. albicans, with most drugs reducing or antagonising antifungal efficacy, several through increasing resistance or tolerance. Notably, fluconazole combinations with carvedilol and loperamide promoted antifungal resistance in both fungal cultures and in Galleria mellonella. Interpretation Our findings suggest that medications frequently taken by patients at risk of fungal infections regularly act on the fungal pathogens and can affect the effectiveness of antifungals. We propose that human drugs acting on fungal pathogens may be an underestimated factor contributing to the evolution of antifungal tolerance and resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

While OROV has been sporadically detected in Colombia since 2017, with a handful of cases in Cucuta and Leticia, the distribution of OROV prior to that remains unknown. Therefore, we undertook to test a clinical cohort of febrile patients from Colombia to determine if OROV was circulating within the human population earlier than previously determined. We screened 631 serum samples collected in 2014-2015 from three municipalities: Cucuta, Los Patios, and Ocana. We found evidence of OROV infection in three patients from Ocana, though live virus was not recoverable from patient sera. These data suggest that OROV circulation, while sporadically detected in Colombia, has circulated earlier than previously thought. With the emergence and expansion of new or neglected viruses, there is a need to expand screening of febrile patients both retro- and prospectively to describe and better understand the distribution of arbovirus circulation in human populations.

In prokaryotes, regulation at the level of the epitranscriptome is still poorly understood. Here, we used Nanopore direct RNA sequencing of Escherichia coli to study RNA modifications and their changes under heat stress. With a single sequencing reaction, we detected most known modification types in rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. RNA sequencing was complemented by a multifaceted approach that included mass spectrometry, deletion mutants, single-nucleotide PCR, and in vitro methylation. Known m5C and m6A sites in the rRNA were confirmed, but these types of modifications could not be localized in the mRNA. In response to heat stress, levels of m5C, m6A, and m6,6A increased in the 16S rRNA. Sequencing and mass spectrometry data demonstrated a decrease in tRNA modification abundance in the anticodon loop at 45 oC. In general, mRNA modifications at 37 oC were enriched in the coding regions of genes associated with general metabolism and RNA processing, which shifted to genes involved in cell wall synthesis and membrane transport under heat stress. This study provides new insights into the complexity of post-transcriptional regulation in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Their expansion shapes genome variability and evolution by impacting gene expression and rearrangement rates. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are beneficial plant symbionts with large, TE-rich genomes, and recent findings showed these elements vary significantly in abundance, evolution, and regulation among model AMF strains. Here, we aimed to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of TE function and evolution in AMF by investigating assembled genomes from representatives of all known families. We uncovered multiple, family-specific bursts of insertions in different species, indicating variable past and ongoing TE activity contributing to the diversification of AMF lineages. We also found that TEs are preferentially located within and around candidate effectors/secreted proteins, as well as in proximity to promoters. Altogether, these findings support the role of TEs in promoting the diversity in proteins involved in molecular dialogues with hosts and, more generally, in driving gene regulation. The mechanisms of TEs evolution we observed in these prominent plant symbionts bear striking similarities to those of many filamentous plant pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

In this study, we elucidated the function of an unknown function protein named GarP (GpsB-associated regulator of PBP1a), in the regulation of PBP1a activity. We showed that GarP localizes to the division septum and its absence leads to morphological defects. We further identified a GpsB-binding motif in GarP as well as in PBP2a, the PG deacetylase PgdA and the muramidase MpgA.

Individuals who consume alcohol to alleviate the effects of social stress are more likely to develop an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Repeated social defeat stress (SDS) enhances the rewarding and reinforcing effects of alcohol. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie social stress-escalated alcohol drinking are not well understood. Here we explored the role of the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (Dyn/KOR) system in regulating social stress-escalated alcohol consumption. Methods: Male and female mice were subjected to repeated SDS for 10 days following which they were left undisturbed in their home cages. They were then subject to intermittent access (IA) two-bottle choice alcohol consumption procedure. The effects of systemic and BNST-specific KOR antagonism using the selective KOR antagonist NorBNI on stress-escalated drinking were evaluated. Using chemogenetic approaches in Oprk1-Cre mice, we examined the role of KOR expressing cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLAKORs) and BLAKOR-BNST pathway in social stress-escalated alcohol consumption. Results: Repeated SDS increased alcohol consumption and preference in both males and females. Systemic KOR antagonism attenuated SDS- escalated alcohol consumption in both males and females. BNST -specific KOR antagonism also attenuated stress-escalated drinking in males. Finally, selective chemogenetic activation of BLAKORs and BKAKOR-BNST pathway attenuated social stress-escalated alcohol consumption in both sexes. Conclusion: Our results suggest a significant role for BLAKOR projections to the BNST in regulating social stress-escalated alcohol consumption. Our results provide further evidence that the Dyn/KOR system maybe a viable target for medications development to treat comorbid stress and AUD.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Previous studies have clarified that the downstream transcriptional responses to eATP involve jasmonate (JA)-based signaling components such as the JA receptor (COI1) and JA-responsive bHLH transcription factors (MYCs). However, the specific contributions of JA signaling itself on eATP signaling are unexplored. Here, we report that JA primes plant responses to eATP through P2K1. Our findings show that JA treatment significantly upregulates P2K1 transcription, corroborating our observation that JA facilitates eATP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation and transcriptional reprogramming in a JA signaling-dependent manner. Additionally, we find that salicylic acid represses eATP-induced plant response. These results suggest that JA accumulation during biotic or abiotic stresses may potentiate eATP signaling, enabling plants to better cope with subsequent stress events.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

A prominent example is the anti-cancer therapeutic paclitaxel (Taxol(R)). Identification of the full paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway would enable heterologous drug production, but it has eluded discovery despite a half century of intensive research. Within the search space of Taxus' large, enzyme-rich genome, we suspected the complex paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional gene co-expression analysis and small sample sets. To improve the resolution of gene set identification, we developed a multiplexed perturbation strategy to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues, cell types, developmental stages, and elicitation conditions. This approach revealed a set of paclitaxel biosynthetic genes that segregate into expression modules that suggest consecutive biosynthetic sub-pathways. These modules resolved seven new genes that, when combined with previously known enzymes, are sufficient for the de novo biosynthesis of baccatin III, an industrial precursor for Taxol, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves at levels comparable to the natural abundance in Taxus needles. Included are taxane 1{beta}-hydroxylase (T1{beta}H), taxane 9-hydroxylase (T9H), taxane 7{beta}-O-acyltransferase (T7AT), taxane 7{beta}-O-deacetylase (T7dA), taxane 9-O-deacetylase (T9dA), and taxane 9-oxidase (T9ox). Importantly, the T9H we discovered is distinct and independently evolved from those recently reported, which failed to yield baccatin III with downstream enzymes. Unexpectedly, we also found a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like protein (FoTO1) crucial for high yields of taxanes; this gene promotes the formation of the desired product during the first taxane oxidation step, resolving a longstanding bottleneck in paclitaxel pathway reconstitution. Together with a new {beta}-phenylalanine-CoA-ligase, the eight genes discovered in this study enables the complete reconstitution of 3'-N-debenzoyl-2'-deoxy-paclitaxel with a 20-enzyme pathway in Nicotiana plants. More broadly, we establish a generalizable approach for pathway discovery that scales the power of co-expression studies to match the complexity of specialized metabolism, enabling discovery of gene sets responsible for high-value biological functions.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

However, the release dynamics of each transmitter in various contexts have not been fully understood in behaving animals. Here, we demonstrate that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the external lateral subdivision of the parabrachial nucleus (CGRPPBel) encode opposing valence via differential release, rather than co-release, of glutamate and neuropeptides, according to firing rate. Glutamate is released preferentially at lower firing rates with minimal release at higher firing rates, whereas neuropeptides are released at higher firing rates, resulting in frequency-dependent switching of transmitters. Aversive stimuli evoke high frequency responses with accompanying neuropeptide release to encode negative valence, whereas appetitive stimuli evoke low frequency responses with glutamate release to encode positive valence. Our study reveals a previously unknown capability of single CGRPPBel neurons to bidirectionally encode valence via frequency-dependent differential release of transmitters in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

We present Deaminase-Assisted single-molecule chromatin Fiber sequencing (DAF-seq), which leverages a non-specific double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A (SsDddA) to efficiently stencil protein occupancy along DNA molecules via selective deamination of accessible cytidines, which are preserved via C-to-T transitions upon DNA amplification. We demonstrate that DAF-seq enables ~200,000-fold enrichment of target loci for single-molecule footprinting at near single-nucleotide resolution, enabling the precise delineation of the regulatory logic guiding neighboring proteins to cooperatively occupy chromatin fibers. Furthermore, DAF-seq enables the synchronous identification of single-molecule chromatin and genetic architectures - resolving the functional impact of rare somatic variants, as well as transitional chromatin states guiding haplotype-selective promoter actuation. Finally, we demonstrate that single-cell DAF-seq enables the accurate reconstruction of the diploid genome and epigenome from a single cell, revealing that a cell's accessible regulatory landscape can diverge by as much as 63% while still retaining the cell's identity.

By taking combined genetic, biochemical, imaging, and genomic approaches, we found that SET-21 functions synergistically with a previously reported H3K23 HMT SET-32 to deposit H3K23me3 at the native targets of germline nuclear RNAi. We identified a subset of native nuclear RNAi targets that are transcriptionally activated in the set-21;set-32 double mutant. SET-21 and SET-32 are also required for robust transgenerational gene silencing induced by exogenous dsRNA. The set-21;set-32 double mutant strain exhibits an enhanced temperature-sensitive mortal germline phenotype compared to the set-32 single mutant, while the set-21 single mutant animals are fertile. We also found that HRDE-1 and SET-32 are required for cosuppression, a transgene-induced gene silencing phenomenon, in C. elegans germline.

Amphotericin B (AmB), which is the first line therapy for invasive pulmonary mucormycosis, has been shown to promote or inhibit replication of a spectrum of viruses. In this study, we first predicted that AmB and Nystatin had strong interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins using in silico screening, indicative of drugs with potential therapeutic activity against this virus. Subsequently, we investigated the impact of AmB, Nystatin, Natamycin, Fluconazole and Caspofungin on SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in vitro. Results showed that AmB and Nystatin actually increased SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6, Calu-3 and Huh7 cells. At optimal concentrations, AmB and Nystatin increase SARS-CoV-2 replication by up to 100- and 10-fold in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, respectively. The other antifungals tested had no impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Drug kinetic studies indicate that AmB enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection by promoting viral entry into cells. Additionally, knockdown of genes encoding for interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins 1, 2, and 3 suggests AmB enhances SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by overcoming the antiviral effect of the IFITM3 protein.

We approached organization by profiling the activity and spatial location of >23,000 neurons recorded in awake mice.

Instead, we observed a robust relationship between spontaneous activity patterns and intra-PFC hierarchy, suggesting internal organization principles transcending cytoarchitecture. Single neuron responses to sounds did not reflect intra-PFC hierarchy but were linked to spontaneous firing rate, indicating that responsiveness increases with excitability and is decoupled from the PFC's intrinsic operational structure.

Both the row and the column decoders are soft input and soft output, enabling further improvement in data recovery accuracy through iterative decoding. The staircase interleaver facilitates extensive parallel decoding capabilities while effectively preserving parallelism across a multitude of nodes. In the in vitro experiment, DNA StairLoop successfully recovered the raw information in a staircase block with a nucleotide error rate of more than 8%.

The cV2F score leverages features reflecting variant-level experimentally and computationally predicted function (e.g. allelic imbalance and sequence-based deep learning models) and element-level function (e.g. predicted enhancers), and learns optimal combinations of features by training a gradient boosting model on GWAS fine-mapping results. The cV2F-annotated variants attained an AUPRC of 0.822 at identifying held-out fine-mapped variants. Variants with high cV2F scores are highly enriched for heritability (14.2x, s.e. 0.5) across 66 diseases/traits, are uniquely informative for disease heritability, and are highly predictive of variants implicated by reporter assays; cV2F substantially outperforms previous variant-to-function scores using all of these metrics.

Multivariate pattern analysis showed that in report conditions, neural processing of cued targets was earlier, stronger, and more generalized in the frontoparietal region; in no-report conditions, only cued targets were decoded in the parieto-occipital region. Our findings indicate that retrospective attention can trigger visual perception independently of cue awareness and the target reporting, thus contributing to current discussions on theories of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Yet, in situ peptide identification remains challenging. Therefore, this study aims to integrate the trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS)-based parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) into MALDI imaging of peptides to enable multiplexed MS/MS imaging. METHODS An initial MALDI TIMS MS1 survey measurement is performed, followed by a manual generation of a precursor list containing mass over charge values and ion mobility windows. Inside the dual TIMS system, submitted precursors are trapped, separately eluted by their ion mobility and analyzed in a quadrupole time-of-flight device, thereby enabling multiplexed MALDI MS/MS imaging. Finally, precursors are identified by peptide to spectrum matching. RESULTS This study presents the first multiplexed MALDI TIMS MS/MS imaging (iprm-PASEF) of tryptic peptides. Its applicability is showcased on two histomorphologically distinct tissue specimens in a 4-plex and 5-plex setup. Precursors were successfully identified by the search engine MASCOT in one single MALDI imaging experiment for each respective tissue. Peptide identifications were corroborated by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry experiments and fragment colocalization analyses. CONCLUSIONS In the present study, we demonstrate the feasibility of TIMS-based MALDI MS/MS imaging for the multiplexed and rapid identification of tryptic peptides in a spatial manner. Hence, it represents a first step in the integration of MALDI imaging into the emerging field of spatial proteomics.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Detecting MEIs through DNA sequencing relies on supporting reads overlapping MEI junctions; however, artifacts from DNA amplification, sequencing, and alignment errors produce numerous false positives. Systematic detection of somatic MEIs, particularly those with low mosaicism, remains a significant challenge. Previous methods had required a high number of supporting reads which limits the detection sensitivity, or human inspections that are susceptible to biases. Here, we developed RetroNet, an algorithm that encodes MEI-supporting sequencing reads into images, and employs a deep neural network to identify somatic MEIs with as few as two reads. Trained on extensive and diverse datasets and benchmarked across various conditions, RetroNet surpasses previous methods and eliminates the need for extensive manual examinations. When applied to bulk whole genome sequencing of a cancer cell line, RetroNet achieved an average precision of 0.885 and recall of 0.845 for detecting somatic L1 insertions, including four true mutations with only two supporting reads. RetroNet is applicable to the rapidly generated short-read sequencing data and has the potential to provide further insights into the functional and pathological implications of somatic retrotranspositions.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

When measured as fractional shortening, this is an order of magnitude faster than motion powered by actomyosin. Myonemes, which are protein networks found near the cortex of many protists, are believed to power Spirostomum contraction. Fast contraction, slow elongation, and calcium-triggering are hallmarks of myoneme-based motion. The biochemical basis of this motion and the molecular mechanism that supports such fast speeds are not well understood. Previous work suggests that myoneme structures in some protists are rich in centrin and Sfi1 homologs, two proteins that may underlie contraction. Centrin undergoes a significant conformational change in the presence of calcium, allowing it to bind to other centrin molecules. To understand Spirostomum contraction, we measure changes in cortical structures and model contraction of the whole cell and of the underlying protein complexes. We provide evidence that centrin/Sfi1 structures are responsible for contraction, which we propose is powered by a modulated entropic spring. Using this model, we recapitulate organismal-scale contraction in mesh simulation experiments and demonstrate the importance of structural organization of myoneme in a fishnet-like structure. These results provide a cohesive, multiscale model for the contraction of Spirostomum. Deeper understanding of how single cells can execute extreme shape changes holds potential for advancing cell biophysics, synthetically engineering contractile machinery, and cellular-inspired engineering designs.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

The traditional template-matching-based approaches for particle picking suffer from template-specific biases and have low throughput. Given these problems, learning-based solutions are necessary for particle picking. However, the paucity of annotated data for training poses substantial challenges for such learning-based approaches. Moreover, preparing extensively annotated cryo-ET tomograms for particle picking is extremely time-consuming and burdensome. Addressing these challenges, we present TomoPicker, an annotation-efficient particle-picking approach that can effectively pick particles when only a minuscule portion ({approx} 0.3-0.5%) of the total particles in a cellular cryo-ET dataset is provided for training. TomoPicker regards particle picking as a voxel classification problem and solves it with two different positive-unlabeled learning approaches. We evaluated our method on a benchmark cryo-ET dataset of eukaryotic cells, where we observed about 30% improvement by TomoPicker against the most recent state-of-the-art annotation efficient learning-based picking approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Uncovering the genome-wide activity of all gene regulators across tissues is therefore needed to understand how the genome is regulated during development. Here, we take a first step forward towards achieving this goal. Using CUT&RUN, we systematically measured the genome-wide binding profiles of key transcription factors and cofactors that mediate the activity of ontogenetically relevant signaling pathways in select mouse tissues at two developmental stages. Computation of the numerous genome-wide binding datasets unveiled a large degree of tissue and time-specific activity for each gene regulator, and several factor-specific idiosyncrasies. Moreover, we identified ""popular"" regulatory regions that are bound by a multitude of pathway regulators. Popular regions tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, implying their essentiality. Consistently, they lie in the proximity of genes whose dysregulation causes early embryonic lethality in the mouse. Moreover, the human homologs of these regions are also bound by many gene regulators and are highly conserved in human populations, indicating that they retain functional relevance for human development. This work constitutes a decisive step towards understanding how the genome is simultaneously read and used by gene regulators in a holistic fashion and unveils multiple genomic mechanisms that drive embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course.

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the viruss origin.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023.

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

A key factor in their success is the ability to filter out erroneous k-mers by removing those with low abundance. However, the vast number of distinct k-mers makes k-mer counting a significant resource bottleneck. Early tools addressed this issue by storing k-mers on disk. To mitigate the excessive redundancy caused by overlapping k-mers, super-k-mers were introduced, significantly decreasing memory usage. Nevertheless, consecutive super-k-mers still overlap by k - 1 bases, leading to some degree of inefficiency. In this work, we introduce hyper-k-mers, a novel approach that further reduces redundancy. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose hyper-k-mers, a new representation of k-mers that asymptotically decreases duplication compared to super-k-mers. Second, we present a theoretical analysis comparing the space efficiency of super-k-mers, syncmers, and hyper-k-mers. Our approach offers significant advantages by reducing the asymptotic lower bound from 6 bits per nucleotide for super-k-mers to 4 bits per kmer. Third, we present KFC, a k-mer counting algorithm that leverages hyper-k-mers. KFC offers significant practical advantages, including an order of magnitude improvement in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art tools. Notably, our experiments show that KFC is the only tool whose resource usage does not scale linearly with the size of k and is the fastest option for large k-mer sizes.

Related taxa tend to also live in similar ecological niches - this trend is termed Niche conservatism. Both concepts are widely used to understand crucial aspects of evolution and speciation and are well-established in animals and plants. The extension of these concepts to microorganisms is however challenging and thus far only assumed. Here, we hypothesize that two closely related microbial species, if indeed similar in both their morphology and their ecological niche, should be found in samples with similar community compositions. We propose ""community conservatism"" to refer to this, and leverage a database with millions of samples and hundreds of thousands of pairs of microbial taxa to assess their relatedness and the similarity of the communities they occupy. Our findings reveal that community conservatism can be observed globally in all environments and phyla tested, to varying extents. Ecologically specialized taxa show a stronger community conservatism signal than generalists, and the signal can be discerned over nearly all taxonomic ranks. Analyzing community conservatism shows promise to advance our understanding of evolution, speciation, and the mechanisms governing community assembly in microorganisms.

We introduce graphREML, a precise and powerful likelihood-based heritability partition and enrichment analysis method. graphREML operates on GWAS summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium graphical models (LDGMs), whose sparsity makes likelihood calculations tractable. We validate our method using extensive simulations and in analyses of a wide range of real traits.

Microtubule growth, shortening and transitions between them are linked to GTP hydrolysis. Recent evidence suggests that flexible tubulin protofilaments at microtubule ends adopt a variety of shapes, complicating structural analysis using conventional techniques. Therefore, the link between GTP hydrolysis, protofilament structure and microtubule polymerization state is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of microtubule ends using coarse-grained modeling supported by atomistic simulations and cryo-electron tomography. We show that individual bent protofilaments organize in clusters, transient precursors to a straight microtubule lattice, with GTP-bound ends showing elevated and more persistent cluster formation. Differences in the mechanical properties of GTP- and GDP-protofilaments result in differences in intra-cluster tension, determining both clustering propensity and protofilament length. We propose that conformational selection at microtubule ends favors long-lived clusters of short GTP-protofilaments that are more prone to form a straight microtubule lattice and accommodate new tubulin dimers. Conversely, microtubule ends trapped in states with unevenly long and stiff GDP-protofilaments are more prone to shortening. We conclude that protofilament clustering is a key phenomenon that links the hydrolysis state of single tubulins to the polymerization state of the entire microtubule.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Recently, we challenged classical views of platelet generation, demonstrating that megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs), and ultimately platelets, can be specified via an alternate and additive route of HSC-direct specification specifically during aging. This ""shortcut"" pathway generates hyperactive platelets likely to contribute to age-related platelet-mediated morbidities. Here, we used single-cell RNA/CITEseq to demonstrate that these age-unique, non-canonical (nc)MkPs can be prospectively defined and experimentally isolated from wild type mice. Surprisingly, this revealed that a rare population of ncMkPs also exist in young mice. Young and aged ncMkPs are functionally distinct from their canonical (c)MkP counterparts, with aged ncMkPs paradoxically and uniquely exhibiting enhanced survival and platelet generation capacity. We further demonstrate that aged HSCs generate significantly more ncMkPs than their younger counterparts, yet this is accomplished without strict clonal restriction. Together, these findings reveal significant phenotypic, functional, and aging-dependent heterogeneity among the MkP pool and uncover unique features of megakaryopoiesis throughout life, potentially offering cellular and molecular targets for mitigation of age-related adverse thrombotic events.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

However, it remains unclear how well traits explain variation in the outcomes of current and novel competition, as well as the underlying processes determining coexistence or competitive exclusion, under changing climate. Here, we conducted a field experiment in which pairs of high and low-elevation species interacted in three sites across an elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps. For each species pair, we quantified the population-level outcomes of competition (invasion growth rates), relative fitness differences and niche overlap and related these to 15 functional traits that were measured in each site. Most traits were significantly associated with invasion growth rates at the low elevation, where species had greater relative fitness differences, but these associations were much weaker towards higher elevations. This appears to be because traits, particularly those associated with light competition, captured species relative fitness differences at lower elevations, but not at the high elevation site. Greater relative fitness differences towards lower elevations suggest that climate warming may increase the likelihood of competitive exclusion of species that are poor competitors for light. In addition, novel competitors tended to show greater niche overlap than current competitors, leading to stronger overall competitive effects. But in general, trait differences predicted competitive outcomes of novel and current competitors similarly well, suggesting that traits can be used to predict interactions between species that do not yet interact. Our study reinforces the importance of considering changing interactions for predicting species responses to climate change and provides experimental evidence supporting the usefulness of functional trait differences in forecasting the impacts of future plant interactions under changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

We can travel internally through a timeline to remember the past and imagine the future (i.e., mental time travel) or watch from an external standpoint to have a panoramic view of history (i.e., mental time watching). However, the neural mechanisms that support these flexible temporal construals remain unclear. To investigate this, we asked participants to learn a fictional religious ritual of 15 events. During fMRI scanning, they were guided to consider the event series from either an internal or external perspective in different tasks. Behavioral results confirmed the success of our manipulation, showing the expected symbolic distance effect in the internal-perspective task and the reverse effect in the external-perspective task. We found that the activation level in the posterior partial cortex correlated positively with sequential distance in the external-perspective task but negatively in the internal-perspective task. In contrast, the activation level in the anterior hippocampus positively correlated with sequential distance regardless of the observer's perspectives. These results suggest that the hippocampus stores the memory of the event sequences allocentrically in a perspective-agnostic manner. Conversely, the posterior parietal cortex retrieves event sequences egocentrically from the optimal perspective for the current task context. Such complementary allocentric and egocentric representations support both the stability of memory storage and the flexibility of time construals.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Molecular dynamics simulations show C1P interaction promotes a long to short transition and energetically stabilizes Mshort. Cryo-EM structures show C1P specifically binds Mshort at a conserved site bridging transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Disrupting Mshort-C1P interaction alters M subcellular localization, reduces interaction with Spike and E, and impairs subsequent virus-like particle cell entry.

Little is known about JCV pathogenesis, and no host factors required for cellular infection have been identified. Recently, we identified low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (Lrp1) as a host entry factor for two other bunyaviruses Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Oropouche virus (OROV). Here, we assessed the role of Lrp1 in mediating JCV cellular infection of neurons. Both neuronal and non-neuronal immortalized cell lines deficient for Lrp1 displayed reduction in infection with JCV, and early stages of infection such as binding and internalization were impacted by lack of Lrp1. In primary rat neurons, Lrp1 was highly expressed, and the neurons were highly permissive for JCV infection. Treatment of primary neurons with recombinant receptor-associated protein (RAP), a high affinity ligand for Lrp1, resulted in reduced infectivity with JCV. In addition, pretreatment of cells with RVFV Gn inhibited JCV infection, suggesting that the two viruses may share overlapping binding sites. These results provide compelling evidence that Lrp1 is an important cellular factor for efficient infection by JCV, and thus multiple bunyaviruses with varying clinical manifestations and tissue tropism are facilitated by the host cell Lrp1. Reliance of multiple bunyaviruses on Lrp1 makes it a promising target for pan-bunyaviral antivirals and therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527383

Here, we present a supervised machine learning framework to describe SCTLD progression in a major reef-building coral, Montastraea cavernosa, and its dominant algal endosymbiont, Cladocopium goreaui. Utilizing support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) in conjunction with differential expression analysis, we identify a subset of biologically relevant genes that exhibit the highest classification performance across three types of coral tissues collected from a natural reef environment: apparently healthy tissue on an apparently healthy colony, apparently healthy tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony, and lesion tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony. By analyzing gene expression signatures associated with these tissue health states in both the coral host and its algal endosymbiont (family Symbiodiniaceae), we describe key processes involved in SCTLD resistance and disease progression within the coral holobiont. Our findings further support evidence that SCTLD causes dysbiosis between the coral host and its Symbiodinaiceae and additionally describes the metabolic and immune shifts that occur as the holobiont transitions from a healthy to a diseased state.

The noncovalent complex of ribozyme fragments initiates low level aminoacylation of one of the fragments, which after loop-closing ligation generates a highly active covalently-linked chimeric ribozyme. The generation of this ribozyme is increasingly efficient over time due to the autocatalytic assembly cycle that sustains the ribozyme over indefinite cycles of serial dilution.

For brevity, we use the term GLP-1 RA to refer to both GLP-1 RA and dual GLP-1 RA/GIP medications.

ObjectiveTo describe recent trends in prescribing and dispensing of GLP-1-based medications in the US.

MethodsUsing a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the US, we identified people who were prescribed a GLP-1-based medication between January 01, 2018 and June 30, 2024. We describe prescribing volumes and patient characteristics over time, by medication, and by FDA-labeled use. Among the subset of patients for whom post-prescription dispensing data is available, we describe the proportion and characteristics of patients who were and were not dispensed a GLP-1 RA following their prescription.

Results1,162,662 patients were prescribed a GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and June 2024, with 4,815,135 total prescriptions during this period. Among first-time prescriptions for which use could be established, ADMs accounted for 83.0% and AOMs accounted for 17.0%. The most common first-time medication was semaglutide (n = 644,272). Among those with available data, 70.0% of first-time ADM prescriptions overall and 73.7% in March 2024 had a fill within 60 days. By comparison, 43.6% of first-time AOM prescriptions overall and 47.2% in March 2024 had a fill within 60 days.

Failure of this process, in compromised mitochondria, leads to kinase activation at the surface, and ultimately mitophagy. Analysis of PINK1-import within intact cells reveals an alternative pathway into the matrix. Structural modelling predicts that the trans-membrane-domain (TMD) of PINK1 forms either an alpha-helix or alpha/beta-hybrid at the interface between Tim17, of the TIM23-core-complex, and, respectively, either Romo1 or PARL. These mutually exclusive interactions both encapsulate a hydrated protein-channel. The alpha-helical-TMD form adopts a pose suggestive of translocation through the Romo1/Tim17-channel, while the alpha/beta-hybrid-TMD is retracted into the PARL active-site for cleavage, presumably after import through the adjacent rhomboid/Tim17-channel. We propose structural plasticity of the PINK1-TMD underlies alternative destinies for full-length matrix-import or cleavage/retro-translocation. The results reveal new insights of the role of PINK1 in mitochondrial function, quality-control and early-onset Parkinsons disease.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527384

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527384

Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD).

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were generally conserved across all three vaccines. Together, the data support the selection of JN.1- or KP.2-adapted vaccines for the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine formula.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527384

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527384

In mammals, DNA methylation is a biomarker for biological age, which may predict age more accurately than date of birth. However, limitations in mammalian models make it difficult to identify mechanisms underpinning age-related DNA methylation changes. Here, we show that the short-lived model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits a loss of epigenetic integrity during aging, causing heterochromatin DNA methylation decay and the expression of transposable elements. We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing lifespan, and that shoot apical meristems are protected from this aging process. We demonstrate that a program of transcriptional repression suppresses DNA methylation maintenance pathways during aging, and that mutants of this mechanism display a complete absence of epigenetic decay. This presents a new paradigm in which a gene regulatory program sets the rate of epigenomic information loss during aging.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527384

However, data on the type of antibiotics prescribed for such infections is only available for children <5 years in the UK. Understanding the contribution of RSV to antibiotic prescribing would facilitate predicting the impact of RSV preventative measures on antibiotic use and resistance.

ObjectivesTo estimate the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions in English general practice attributable to RSV by age and antibiotic class.

MethodsGeneralised additive models examined associations between weekly counts of general practice antibiotic prescriptions and laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections from 2015 to 2018, adjusting for temperature, practice holidays and remaining seasonal confounders. We used general practice records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and microbiology tests for RSV, influenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, human Metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae from Englands Second Generation Surveillance System.

ResultsAn estimated 2.1% of antibiotics were attributable to RSV, equating to an average of 640,000 prescriptions annually. Of these, adults [&ge;]75 years contributed to the greatest volume, with an annual average of 149,078 (95% credible interval: 93,733-206,045). Infants 6-23 months had the highest average annual rate at 6,580 prescriptions per 100,000 individuals (95% credible interval: 4,522-8,651). Most RSV-attributable antibiotic prescriptions were penicillins, macrolides or tetracyclines. Adults [&ge;]65 years had a wider range of antibiotic classes associated with RSV compared to younger age groups.

ConclusionsInterventions to reduce the burden of RSV, particularly in older adults, could complement current strategies to reduce antibiotic use in England.","NA","medrxiv",1731276527384

However, deriving specific phenotypes from MRI data requires time-consuming expert annotation, limiting scalability and does not exploit how information dense such image acquisitions are. In this study, we applied a 3D diffusion autoencoder to temporally resolved cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from 71,021 UK Biobank participants to derive latent phenotypes representing the human heart in motion. These phenotypes were reproducible, heritable (h2 = [4 - 18%]), and significantly associated with cardiometabolic traits and outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (P = 8.5 x 10-29) and myocardial infarction (P = 3.7 x 10-12). By using latent space manipulation techniques, we directly interpreted and visualised what specific latent phenotypes were capturing in a given MRI. To establish the genetic basis of such traits, we performed a genome-wide association study, identifying 89 significant common variants (P < 2.3x10-9) across 42 loci, including seven novel loci. Extensive multi-trait colocalisation analyses (PP.H4 > 0.8) linked these variants to various cardiac traits and diseases, revealing a shared genetic architecture spanning phenotypic scales. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) derived from latent phenotypes demonstrated predictive power for a range of cardiometabolic diseases and high risk individuals had substantially increased cumulative hazard rates across a range of diseases. This study showcases the use of diffusion autoencoding methods as powerful tools for unsupervised phenotyping, genetic discovery and disease risk prediction using cardiac MRI imaging data.","NA","medrxiv",1731276527384

We demonstrate that the small molecule not only rescues aberrant buildup of both axonal autophagic and lysosomal intermediates but also reduces secreted A{beta}42 levels in human iPSC-derived neurons lacking the lysosomal adaptor, JIP3. We thus demonstrate that restoring efficient axonal lysosome transport has an anti-amyloidogenic effect in human neurons and is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimers disease. Furthermore, we show that the small molecule enhances neuronal lysosome degradation, requires the lysosomal adaptor JIP4 to rescue the axonal lysosome pathology in the JIP3 KO neurons and increases levels of the JIP4-interacting lysosomal membrane protein, TMEM55B. Lastly, treatment with the small molecule led to a striking rescue of locomotor defects in JIP3 KO zebrafish larvae. Thus, we have identified a small molecule which can be impactful in neurodegenerative diseases that have a lysosomal pathology and have determined its molecular targets in modulating axonal lysosome abundance.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527384

Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered during flight like a flag in the wind. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.","NA","biorxiv",1731276527384

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1731276527384
