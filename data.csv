Existing automated methods for connectome reconstruction from high-resolution images of brain tissue introduce errors that require extensive and time-consuming manual correction, a critical bottleneck in the field. To address this, we developed PATHFINDER, an AI system that segments volumetric image data, identifies potential ways to assemble neuron fragments, and evaluates the plausibility of resulting shapes to reconstruct complete neurons. Using a dataset of all axons in an IBEAM-mSEM volume of mouse cortex, we show that PATHFINDER reduces the error rate in axon reconstruction by an order of magnitude over previous state of the art, leading to an improvement in proofreading throughput of up to 84x relative to prior estimates in the context of a whole mouse brain. By drastically reducing the manual effort required for analysis, this advance unlocks the potential for both large-scale connectome mapping and routine investigation of smaller volumes.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786660

Here, we established a systematic CRISPR-based protein-tagging approach that enables direct, unambiguous comparison of nuclear localization and genome-wide binding profiles of endogenous ZAD-ZnFs in developing Drosophila embryos. Evidence is provided that a subset of ZAD-ZnFs forms nuclear condensates through the stacking of the N-terminal ZAD dimerization surface. Disruption of condensation activity leads to misregulation of genome-wide binding profiles and lethality, underscoring its functional and physiological significance in development. Importantly, integrative ChIP-seq and Micro-C data analyses reveal that many ZAD-ZnFs colocalize with core insulator proteins such as CTCF and CP190 to strengthen the formation of topological boundaries. We suggest that the diverse molecular functions of ZAD-ZnFs have evolutionally arisen from their ancestral role as insulator-binding proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786660

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1747951786660

The proposed unequal stoichiometry is inherently incompatible with symmetry. The building of an asymmetric molecular model into density obtained by 11-fold symmetry averaging is inherently self-contradictory. This contradiction alone calls the validity of the derived structure into question. Our own data revealed that the complex primarily adopts an asymmetric open conformation in situ. We show that it was the incorrect symmetry imposition on the open conformation that led to the spoked wheel density reported by Lange et al.. Further validation by re-analysis of crosslinking- mass spectrometry data, and a test of in situ template matching all support a larger prohibitin complex architecture.

Regulation of cell death is mostly orchestrated by the activation of Caspases, proteases which were long thought to trigger an irreversible engagement in cell death. However, recent data in vivo and in vitro outline numerous non-apoptotic functions of caspases as well as quite ubiquitous sublethal activation of effector caspases during development. Yet, it remains unclear in many instances what drives the bifurcation between cell death engagement and cell survival upon caspase activation. The existence of a caspase activity threshold was generally considered to underpin this binary decision, but this was never assessed quantitatively in vivo especially at the single cell level. Using quantitative live imaging combined with machine learning and optogenetics in the Drosophila pupal notum (a single layer epithelium), we reveal for the first time the existence of a large heterogeneity of caspase sensitivity between cells, as well as the existence of distinct spatial domains with low or high sensitivity to caspases. Using correlative and perturbative experiments, we outline the central role of past exposure to sublethal caspase activity which sensitises cells for apoptosis for several hours. Integrating information about past caspase activation is sufficient to explain most of the global pattern of caspase sensitivity and predict at the single cell level which cells will engage in apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that past sublethal caspase activation in a subset of cells is sufficient to bias cell elimination at the clonal and single cell level, thus revealing an alternative mechanism of physiological cell competition. Altogether, this work reveals for the first time the existence of a new layer of apoptosis regulation in vivo downstream of effector caspases which can be developmentally regulated and bias clonal selection and the spatial pattern of cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786660

We identify 1,257 lead genetic variants associated with personality, including 823 novel variants. Common genetic variants explain 4.8%-9.3% of the variance in each trait, and 10.5%-16.2% accounting for measurement unreliability. Genetic effects on personality are highly consistent across geography, reporter (self vs. close other), age group, and measurement instrument, and we find minimal spousal assortment for personality in recent history. In stark contrast to many other social and behavioral traits, within-family GWAS and polygenic index analyses indicate little to no shared environmental confounding in genetic associations with personality. Polygenic prediction, genetic correlation, and Mendelian randomization analyses indicate that personality genetics have widespread, potentially causal associations with a wide range of consequential behaviors and life outcomes. The genetic architecture of personality is robust and fundamental to being a human.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Although the components involved in T4P assembly and dynamics are largely conserved across divergent clades of bacteria, the mechanisms underlying T4P function and regulation differ significantly and remain poorly characterized outside of a select few model organisms. One understudied characteristic of T4P includes the spatial organization of T4P envelope-spanning nanomachines and how organizational patterns contribute to single cell behaviors. The bacterial species Acinetobacter baylyi localizes its T4P nanomachines in a unique pattern along the long axis of the cell, making it a robust model to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of intracellular organization in single cell organisms. In this work, we find that the T4P regulatory protein FimX has been co-opted away from regulating T4P dynamics to instead control T4P positioning through a chemosensory Pil-Chp pathway. We show FimX directly interacts with the Pil-Chp histidine kinase ChpA which likely influences Pil-Chp signaling and the subsequent positioning of T4P machines. These data contribute to our understanding of how bacterial regulatory systems can evolve to function in diverse biological processes.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

However, path integration is prone to cumulative error, which can be amplified when body-derived information is inconsistent between encoding and retrieval paths. Drawing on evidence from sensorimotor reactivation during memory retrieval, we hypothesized that re-enacting encoding-related movement patterns could serve as a body-derived mechanism to counteract such errors. In a novel virtual reality task with motion tracking, participants learned unique, irregular step sequences linked to specific target distances during an encoding phase. They later reproduced these distances in complete darkness under three conditions: self-paced free retrieval, retrieval with encoding-congruent movements, and retrieval with encoding-incongruent, regular gait. During free retrieval, participants naturally re-enacted encoding-related movements associated with improved distance reproduction. As predicted, distance estimation was significantly more accurate during congruent retrieval than during incongruent retrieval. These behavioral findings are consistent with a neural network model in which retrieved encoding-related motor patterns correct path integration errors in grid cells. Together, these results provide converging behavioral and computational evidence that body-derived, encoding-related motor patterns can enhance distance estimation, possibly by filtering grid cell error accumulation, offering new insights into embodied mechanisms of path integration.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

While PGSxE regression is potentially more powerful than single-variant genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) due to the aggregation of genetic effects and reduced multiple testing burden, standard PGS reflect many different biological mechanisms, limiting interpretation and potentially diluting pathway-specific interaction signals. Previous work has uncovered significant genome-wide PGSxBMI signal for liver function, but there is an opportunity for additional and more interpretable discoveries. Here, we leverage pathway-specific polygenic scores (pPGS) to discover novel mechanism-specific gene-adiposity interactions. We tested for adiposity interactions impacting three liver-related biomarkers (ALT, AST and GGT) using (1) a standard, genome-wide PGS, (2) an array of pPGS containing variant subsets derived from KEGG pathways, and (3) a GWIS. For ALT, we identified 49 significant pPGSxBMI interactions at a Bonferroni corrected p < 2.7x10-4, 80% of which were not explained by genes close to the 8 loci found in the associated GWIS. Across all biomarkers, we found interactions of BMI with 83 unique pPGS-based on KEGG pathways. We tested alternate pathway collections, including Hallmark gene sets and the KEGG Medicus database, finding that the choice of pathway collection strongly impacts discovery. Our results support the use of pPGS for well powered and interpretable discovery of pPGSxE interactions with adiposity-related exposures for liver biomarkers and motivate future studies using a broader collection of exposures and outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1747951786661

Previous work demonstrated that spike patterns in cerebellar nuclei neurons were distinct between different movement disorder mouse models. However, often these changes arise from neural dysfunction in the cerebellar cortex, through misfiring, miswiring, or degenerating Purkinje cells. Even though Purkinje cells form the sole output from the cerebellar cortex, their information is relayed to other regions of the motor network via cerebellar nuclei cells. Purkinje cells make GABAergic synapses onto cerebellar nuclei cells, and it is often assumed that changes in Purkinje cell spike patterns result in inverse changes in nuclei cell spike patterns. Here, we test this hypothesis by answering the question of whether a reliable relationship between Purkinje cell and nuclei cell spike patterns exists. Single-cell, in vivo electrophysiology recordings of both cell types from six mouse models for cerebellar movement disorders were analyzed according to parameters relating to spike rate and irregularity. We investigated whether Purkinje cell spike patterns correlated with nuclei cell spike patterns. We found that some parameters for firing irregularity were positively correlated between Purkinje and nuclei cells but no -- and particularly no inverse - relationship was observed between Purkinje and nuclei cell spike rate. Overall, this study begins to illuminate that the relationship between Purkinje cells and nuclei cell spike activity in a disease state is more complex and unpredictable. The data suggest Purkinje cell spike activity changes cannot accurately predict nuclei cell changes, which ultimately drive cerebellar disease states. Our findings underscore the importance of studying cerebellar nuclei cell function in cerebellar disease, as lack of changes in Purkinje cell firing patterns can mask disease-causing firing patterns in these cerebellar output cells.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

This question has been challenged by the observation of emergent coexistence, where microbial communities contain species that cannot coexist in pairs, suggesting the presence of non-pairwise mechanisms. Instead, we show that emergent coexistence arises naturally in species-rich models with pairwise interactions. Strikingly, this phenomenon does not require additional mechanisms like intransitive or higher-order interactions; rather, coexistence arises from dense networks of indirect effects. As diversity increases, we show that indirect effects become so intricate that pairwise interactions no longer predict community composition, revealing a fundamental limit to reductionist explanations of coexistence.

We aimed to compare Germany-wide characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with diabetes in diabetes certified vs. non-diabetes certified hospitals.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both). However, among those with diabetes as the main diagnosis, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in diabetes certified hospitals (type 1 diabetes: 0.6% vs. 1.1% and type 2 diabetes: 2.3% vs. 2.9%, both p<0.001), despite a higher complication burden.

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden. These findings suggest that expanded use of DDG-certified departments, including consultation services for patients whose diabetes is a secondary diagnosis, may further improve clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1747951786661

Hfq is an RNA-chaperone conserved in many bacteria that undergoes condensation in response to diverse stresses. Using nitrogen (N) starvation in Escherichia coli as a model stress condition, we show that Hfq condensation occurs independently of any extracellular cues, cytoplasmic shrinkage that cells undergo during N starvation or the canonical NtrBC-dependent adaptive response to N starvation. However, we demonstrate that Hfq condensation is coupled to the inhibition of carbon assimilation in N-starved E. coli. Further, by comparing the transcriptomes of wild-type bacteria and bacteria unable to form Hfq-condensates, we reveal that Hfq-condensates contribute to the stabilisation of Hfq-associated non-coding regulatory RNAs. We propose that coordination of carbon and N metabolism during N starvation, critical for metabolic adaptation, is accompanied by preservation of non-coding regulatory RNAs via Hfq condensation.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

However, despite advances in long-read sequencing that have greatly improved the quality and completeness of bacterial genome assemblies, assembly tools remain prone to large-scale errors caused by repeats in the genome, leading to inaccurate detection of AMR gene content and consequent impact on resistance prediction. In this work we present Amira, a tool to detect AMR genes directly from unassembled long-read sequencing data. Amira leverages the fact that multiple consecutive genes lie within a single read to construct gene-space de Bruijn graphs where the k-mer alphabet is the set of genes in the pan-genome of the species under study. Through this approach, the reads corresponding to different copies of AMR genes can be effectively separated based on the genomic context of the AMR genes, and used to infer the nucleotide sequence of each copy. Amira achieves significant improvements in genomic copy number recall and nucleotide accuracy, demonstrated through objective simulations and comparison with alternative read and assembly-based methods on samples with manually curated truth assemblies. Applied to a dataset of 32 Escherichia coli samples with diverse AMR gene content, Amira achieves a mean genomic-copy-number recall of 98.4% with precision 97.9% and nucleotide accuracy 99.9%. Finally, we compare the number of fully (>90%) present genes with good read support by Amira and Flye with AMRFinderPlus across all E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. faecium nanopore datasets from the ENA (n=8593, 2469 and 420 respectively), quantifying the improvement in recall when handling heterogeneous data.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1747951786661

However, EHR data may be prone to misclassification and unmeasured confounding, requiring systematic mitigation to ensure robust findings.

MethodsIn VEBIS-EHR, a retrospective multi-country COVID-19 VE cohort study, we examined unmeasured confounding using a negative control outcome (death not related to COVID-19) and misclassification from varying data extraction intervals. The evaluation spanned two periods (November-December 2023, January-February 2024), encompassing up to 18.7 million individuals across six EU/EEA countries. Vaccine confounding-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

ResultsaHRs against non-COVID-19 mortality ranged from 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.44) to 0.70 (0.66-0.73) when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Delaying EHR data extraction modestly increased the capture of outcome and exposure events, with some variation by vaccination status. Site-level fluctuations in aHRs did not meaningfully alter the overall pooled VE, suggesting stable estimates despite misclassification related to extraction timing.

ConclusionsWe observed some evidence of unmeasured confounding when using non-COVID-19 deaths as a negative outcome, though the specificity of our negative control must be considered. This result may suggest overestimation of VE, but also the need for further analysis with more specific negative control outcomes and confounding-adjustment techniques. Addressing such confounding using richer data sources and more refined approaches remains critical to ensure accurate, timely VE estimates when using real-world EHR-based data. Extending the delay between the end of observation and data extraction modestly improves the completeness of exposure and outcome data, with limited effect on pooled VE estimates.

Key MessagesA Key Messages section should be added after the keywords and before the articles introduction, with the key messages of the paper made in 3 bullet points that succinctly describe:

O_LIWhat your research question was: Whether vaccine effectiveness estimates based on EHR data are internally valid according to analyses focused on two topics of concern related to EHR-based observational research - unmeasured confounding and misclassification.
C_LIO_LIWhat you found: We observed unmeasured confounding in our estimates when using non-COVID19 deaths as negative outcome, and timing of data abstraction from source EHRs was found to have a small influence on the capture and classification of exposure and outcome.
C_LIO_LIWhy it is important: Our results reinforce earlier evidence of the healthy vaccinee phenomenon indicating possible biases in the estimates of vaccine effectiveness estimates obtained from EHR data and that there appears to be little influence of EHR extraction timing on data completeness.

Eukaryotes and prokaryotes showed high contrast in need for phase-separating proteins and with a clear genome size-dependent correlation. Evolutionary success appears to hinge on the balance between functional condensation and avoiding harmful aggregation-prone biophysical signatures, such as certain amino acid homorepeats embedded in molecular grammar. We also identified potential phase separation-regulated signaling hubs across kingdoms by integrating phase-separation-positive proteins with protein abundance and interactome data across four model eukaryotic species. Consequently, we created PhaseHub (https://phasehub.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/), a user-friendly interface that explores key scaffold proteins and binders to pinpoint associated partners and potential multicomponent phase separation hubs.

Here, we investigate which level of brain organization--regions, networks, or validated whole-brain machine-learning signatures--best explains negative affective traits in a community sample of 458 adults performing the two most widely used affective fMRI tasks, viewing emotional faces and scenes. Neuroticism could not be predicted from brain activity, with Bayesian evidence against all theory-guided neural measures. However, preregistered whole-brain models successfully decoded vulnerability to stress, a lower-level facet of neuroticism, with results replicating in a hold-out sample. The neural stress vulnerability pattern demonstrated good psychometric properties and indicated that negative affective traits are best represented by distributed whole-brain patterns related to domain-general stimulation rather than localized activity. Together with results from a comprehensive multiverse analysis across 14 traits and 1,176 models-- available for exploration in an online app--the findings speak against simplistic neurobiological theories of negative affective traits, highlight a striking gap between predicting individual differences (r<.35) and within-person emotional states (r=.88), and underscore the importance of aligning psychological constructs with neural measures at the appropriate level of granularity.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

While oncogenic mutations in gliomas have been well-characterized, their impact on the tumor microenvironment remains poorly understood. To investigate how genomic alterations may influence the glioma microenvironment, we performed an integrative multiomic and spatial transcriptomic analysis of 93 glioma samples (46 IDH-mutant gliomas and 47 IDH-wildtype glioblastoma) from 69 patients representing both primary and recurrent stages. Using whole-genome sequencing, chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C), RNA-seq, and single-cell spatial transcriptomics (Xenium), we defined how major driver mutations influence spatial tumor organization. We found that IDH-mutant gliomas frequently harbored inflammatory microglia expressing CX3CR1 specifically within their astrocyte-like malignant neighborhoods. In contrast, glioblastomas demonstrated relatively higher T-cell infiltration and enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations. We further compared glioblastomas harboring EGFR amplifications due to extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) amplifications versus linear chromosomal 7 gains. Tumors with EGFR ecDNA displayed increased presence of mesenchymal-like malignant cells, and higher interactions between pericytes and mesenchymal-like malignant cells, likely driven by hypoxia-associated vascular proliferation. Our findings reveal that the mode of oncogene amplification (linear versus ecDNA) shapes distinct tumor architectures and transcriptional dynamics. Taken together, our study highlights the role of oncogenic drivers in shaping the glioma microenvironment, revealing subtype-specific cellular ecosystems that could inform targeted therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

However, the stereomicroscope transillumination design is suboptimal, as a single incident beam at the specimen plane is shared and transmitted via two laterally offset detection axes. This flaw limits life science applications due to the transparent nature of samples which results in poor contrast images. We use a single additional element in the illumination path to correct the illumination uniformity across the field of view and, by doing so, enhance image contrast and facilitate detection of refractive structures in transparent biological specimens. We designed and fabricated an integrated lens-biprism element using low-cost, consumer-grade 3D printing methods and consumables. This 3D printed lens-biprism distributed diverging rays from a single incandescent light source into two parallel beams that converged at the specimen plane and transmitted through the respective left and right detection axes of a stereomicroscope.

Following mitotic stress, the ubiquitin-specific protease 28 (USP28) and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) form a stable, heritable complex to stabilize the tumor suppressor p53, triggering cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Here we determine the mechanism by which USP28 stabilizes p53 and show that USP28 is required not only for an efficient stress response but also for maintaining basal p53 levels in some cancer cells. Loss of functional USP28 allows cells to evade mitotic stress and DNA damage responses in a manner that is specific to cell type and cancer context. We identify a prevalent, shorter USP28 isoform critical for p53 stabilization. Its C-terminal domain mediates PLK1-dependent binding to 53BP1, a dimerization-driven interaction necessary for mitotic stress memory, p53 stabilization, and cell cycle arrest. Cancer-associated missense mutations in this domain disrupt 53BP1 binding, impair nuclear localization, and destabilize USP28, compromising p53 stabilization. Notably, mutations in the 53BP1-binding domain occur more frequently in tumors than those in the catalytic domain, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and implications for therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

To gain a broad overview of the various pathways modulated by the MICOS complex, we examined its molecular neighbourhood. For this, we employed proximity biotinylation assays using APEX2 fused to four MICOS subunits (MIC10, MIC13, MIC26 and MIC27) in the respective mammalian knockout cells. These four MICOS-APEX2 fusion proteins integrated into the native MICOS complex and properly localised as revealed by electron microscopy combined with DAB staining and STED super-resolution nanoscopy.

We introduce BehaveAgent, an autonomous multimodal AI agent designed to automate behavior analysis from video input without retraining or manual intervention. Unlike conventional methods that require manual behavior annotation, video segmentation, task-specific model training, BehaveAgent leverages the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLM) to generalize across novel behavioral domains without need for additional training. It integrates LLMs, vision-language models (VLMs), and large-scale visual grounding modules, orchestrated through a multimodal context memory and goal-directed attention mechanism, to enable robust zero-shot visual reasoning across species and experimental paradigms, including plants, insects, rodents, primates, and humans. Upon receiving a video input, BehaveAgent autonomously identifies the correct analysis strategy and performs end-to-end behavior analysis and interpretation without human supervision. Leveraging vision-language representations, it performs general-purpose tracking, pose estimation and segmentation. We demonstrate BehaveAgents universal applicability to autonomously (1) identify the behavioral paradigm and develop an action plan specialized for the identified paradigm, (2) identify relevant subjects and objects, (3) track those features, (4) identify behavioral sequences with explicit reasoning, (5) generate and execute code for targeted analysis and (6) generate comprehensive research reports that integrate behavioral findings with relevant scientific literature.

In particular, nanoUHPLC/High-Resolution nanoESI-MS/MS enables the characterization of proteins in complex biological samples due to its high sensitivity, accuracy, and scalability. However, LC-MS/MS proteomics might still be susceptible to laboratory and sample-associated contaminants, which can significantly compromise the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, an accurate identification and annotation of such contaminants is crucial for the development of robust proteomics databases and spectral-libraries related search engines. This approach is of special interest in the field of secretome and extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-enclosed nanostructures that contain a variety of proteins crucial for cell-to-cell communication and translational applications. Results When working in ex vivo/in vitro settings, proteins from fetal bovine serum (FBS), commonly employed in standard cell culture media, may interfere with the proteome analysis. To address this issue, we conceived and designed SPROUTS_DB, Serum Protein Repository Of Unwanted Target(ed) Sequences DataBase, a dedicated resource to catalog serum-derived contaminants. Starting from media supplemented with EV-depleted FBS, we simulated cell growth conditions - in the absence of cells - followed by ultracentrifugation. LC-MS/MS analysis of these samples resulted in the identification of a novel set of 1,288 contaminant proteins, which has been deposited in the ProteomeXchange repository (identifier PXD044137). SPROUTS_DB contains primarily soluble proteins, mainly related to the Gene Ontology categories Extracellular Region and Extracellular Space, in line with the nature of the starting sample. In contrast, only a small fraction of the contaminants is classified as membrane-associated proteins, supporting the limited vesicle contamination in the complete medium, due to the use of EV-depleted FBS. Of note, we demonstrated that SPROUTS_DB outperforms existing contaminants databases, ensuring that only peptide spectra relevant to the examined sample are retained and identified as true positive data. Conclusions Considering that even proteins from phylogenetically distant organisms share extensive stretches of sequences, SPROUTS_DB is designed to discern contaminants from real sample proteins of interest, minimizing false positive identifications. To the best of our knowledge, SPROUTS_DB is the most updated database of contaminants useful for proteomics investigations of cellular secretomes and EV-containing samples.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Their carbon lattice structure, denoted by chiral (n,m) indices, determines the wavelength of their near infrared fluorescence emission. Commercially available SWCNT are polydisperse, containing many (n,m) species with overlapping fluorescence peaks, leading to spectral congestion. Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) has emerged as a valuable tool to sort SWCNT according to their chiral structure and promises improved nanosensor performance as well as unique opportunities for multiplexing. Previous applications of ATPE have enabled ratiometric sensors, but simultaneous detection of multiple analytes using distinct SWCNT chiralities has yet to be realized. This hurdle is largely due to the contrasting surface chemistries needed for ATPE sorting and those needed for biosensing applications. In this work, we introduce a method for purifying multiple chiralities of SWCNT which can be functionalized with molecularly specific antibodies to create a multiplexed sensor platform. We utilize aminated DNA (DNA-NH2), which serves as both a conduit for ATPE sorting and an intermediate linker for later antibody conjugation, to realize this goal. We demonstrate that chemically modified DNA enables ATPE sorting, supporting the broad future utility of the technique. We further show that chirality-sorted SWCNT-DNA-NH2 serve as excellent base constructs for antibody conjugation, forming highly specific sensors with enhanced optical properties (compared to unsorted SWCNT sensors). Importantly, one batch of monochiral base constructs can be functionalized with different antibodies towards different biological applications. Finally, we show that we can sort and functionalize two separate SWCNT chiralities and combine them together to create a multiplexed sensor platform where each peak responds distinctly to its target. There are vast opportunities for expansion of this work through the use of alternative DNA sequences to enable sorting, various SWCNT chiralities, and virtually any commercially available antibody for molecular recognition.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Recent studies which separate oscillatory and aperiodic components of electrophysiological power spectra have highlighted a relationship between aperiodic activity and functional brain states. Studies in both animal models and humans suggest that the aperiodic slope of electrophysiological power spectra reflects the local balance of excitatory:inhibitory (E:I) synaptic transmission. Aperiodic slope varies across individuals, brain states, and clinical populations, which may reflect important differences in E:I balance. However, there is currently a lack of evidence linking aperiodic slope to other measures of excitation and inhibition in the human brain. Here, we show that flatter (less steep) aperiodic slopes from human electroencephalography (EEG) are associated with higher concentrations of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate measured with 7 tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the occipital lobe at rest. This suggests that individual differences in aperiodic neural activity reflect cortical glutamate concentrations, providing important insight for understanding changes in neural excitation across brain states and neuropsychiatric populations (e.g., schizophrenia) where glutamatergic function may differ. Our results support the use of aperiodic slope as a non-invasive marker for excitatory tone in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Building on previous work, we have developed an algorithm tailored to converting functional scores from both multiplexed assays of variant effects (MAVEs) and computational variant effect predictors (VEPs) into ACMG/AMP evidence strengths. Our method is designed to deliver consistent performance across different genes and score distributions, with all variables adaptively determined from the input data, preventing selective adjustments or overfitting that could inflate evidence strengths beyond empirical support.

These potent norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors promote wakefulness, suppress appetite, enhance physical performance, and are purported to increase attentional abilities. Prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have yielded conflicting results about the effects of stimulants on the brain's attention, action/motor, and salience regions that are difficult to reconcile with their proposed attentional effects. Here, we utilized resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from the large Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to understand the effects of stimulants on brain functional connectivity (FC) in children (n = 11,875; 8-11 years old) using network level analysis (NLA). We validated these brain-wide association study (BWAS) findings in a controlled, precision imaging drug trial (PIDT) with highly-sampled (165-210 minutes) healthy adults receiving high-dose methylphenidate (Ritalin, 40 mg). In both studies, stimulants were associated with altered FC in action and motor regions, matching patterns of norepinephrine transporter expression. Connectivity was also changed in the salience (SAL) and parietal memory networks (PMN), which are important for reward-motivated learning and closely linked to dopamine, but not the brain's attention systems (e.g. dorsal attention network, DAN). Stimulant-related differences in FC closely matched the rs-fMRI pattern of getting enough sleep, as well as EEG- and respiration-derived brain maps of arousal. Taking stimulants rescued the effects of sleep deprivation on brain connectivity and school grades. The combined noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects of stimulants may drive brain organization towards a more wakeful and rewarded configuration, explaining improved task effort and persistence without direct effects on attention networks.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Plastic responses vary as a result of genetic differentiation within and among species, so accurate rangewide predictions require characterization of genotype-specific reaction norms across the continuum of historic and future climate conditions comprising a species' range. Natural hybrid zones can give rise to novel recombinant genotypes associated with high phenotypic variability, further increasing the variance of plastic responses within the ranges of the hybridizing species. Experiments that plant replicated genotypes across a range of environments can characterize genotype-specific reaction norms; identify genetic, geographic, and climatic factors affecting variation in climate responses; and make predictions of climate responses across complex genetic and geographic landscapes. The North American hybrid zone of Populus trichocarpa and P. balsamifera represents a natural system in which reaction norms are likely to vary with underlying genetic variation that has been shaped by climate, geography, and introgression. Here, we leverage a dataset containing 45 clonal genotypes of varying ancestry from this natural hybrid zone, planted across 17 replicated common garden experiments spanning a broad climatic range, including sites warmer than the natural species ranges. Growth and mortality were measured over two years, enabling us to model reaction norms for each genotype across these tested environments. Genomic variation associated with species ancestry and northern/southern regions significantly influenced growth across environments, with genotypic variation in reaction norms reflecting a trade-off between cold tolerance and growth. Using modeled reaction norms for each genotype, we predicted that genotypes with more P. trichocarpa ancestry may gain an advantage under warmer climates. Spatial shifts of the hybrid zone could facilitate the spread of beneficial alleles into novel climates. These results highlight that genotypic variation in responses to temperature will have landscape-level effects.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

The bacteria releases effector proteins some of which remodel the host autophagic-lysosomal pathways. One effector is RavZ, which delipidates ATG8 proteins, making Legionella-infected cells deficient in autophagy. Here we show that SidE effectors mediate the phosphoribosyl ubiquitination (PR-Ub) of autophagic SNARE proteins STX17 and SNAP29. STX17 modification induces recruitment of STX17+ membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum to Legionella-containing phagosomes to form replicative vacuoles. Using proximity labeling, biochemistry and Legionella infection studies, we have discovered a mechanism by which autophagy is hijacked by bacteria to recruit ER membranes to the bacterial vacuole which has autophagy markers but do not fuse with lysosomes. Mass spectrometric identification of PR-Ub sites and mutational studies show that PR-Ub modification of STX17 alters its interaction with ATG14L, which drives the recruitment of ER membranes to the bacterial vacuole in a PI3K dependent manner. On the other hand, PR-Ub of SNAP29 inhibits the formation of the autophagosomal SNARE complex (STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8) by steric hindrance, thereby preventing the fusion of bacterial vacuoles with lysosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Here, we focus on nitrogen (N2) fixation, one of lifes most critical and ancient metabolisms, to investigate the drivers of complexity in its associated genetic network. We used a large-scale comparative genomics framework to construct a comprehensive catalog of todays N2 fixation-associated genes and assessed their distribution across diverse microbial genomes and environmental backgrounds. Genomes enriched in N2 fixation genes generally have larger genome sizes, broader metabolic capabilities, wider habitat ranges, and are predominantly associated with mesophilic and aerobic lifestyles. Evolutionary reconstructions reveal a pattern of early gene gains in ancestral diazotrophs followed by lineage specific gene losses in later diverging taxa, suggesting evolutionary trade-offs shaped by changing environments. These findings demonstrate that the evolution of N2 fixation has been intertwined with the restructuring of its genetic network, driven by feedbacks between microbial evolution and changing environmental and ecological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

We recently reported that C. burnetii removes the lysosomal protease cathepsin B during infection of mammalian cells. Here, we aimed to determine if this virulence strategy was also employed by the intralysosomal pathogen, Leishmania mexicana. In contrast to C. burnetii, decreases in the activity of specific cathepsins were not detected in L. mexicana-infected host cells as determined using immunoblotting and protease activity-based probes. Co-infection of THP-1 macrophage-like cells with both pathogens resulted in a proteolytic and secretory phenotype consistent with C. burnetii infection, suggesting that C. burnetii-induced remodelling of the lysosome is not influenced by L. mexicana. The host cell proteome and secretome of L. mexicana infected cells was defined using mass spectrometry. This confirmed that, unlike C. burnetii, L. mexicana does not induce increased abundance of lysosomal proteins either intracellularly or in the extracellular milieu. Collectively, this study reveals that although C. burnetii and L. mexicana reside in a phagolysosomal intracellular niche, they employ divergent mechanisms to survive within this hostile compartment.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Different anti-amyloid antibodies have different in vitro binding characteristics to different synthetic A{beta} aggregates, leading to the assumption that they bind different species in the human brain. Lecanemab is hypothesized to bind ""protofibrils,"" but these are not well-characterized in human brain. It is also unknown how binding differences correlate with ARIA-E rates. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele increases ARIA-E risk, but how it affects antibody binding characteristics is unknown. Objectives: To determine whether anti-amyloid antibodies bind different species of human brain A{beta} and whether these binding properties to human brain A{beta} explains ARIA-E rates. Design: Cross-sectional study of 18 postmortem human brains. Setting: Single tertiary care hospital. Participants: Deceased patients with AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Main Outcomes and Measures: Equilibrium binding constants (KD) and total A{beta} binding (Bmax) of recombinant aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab equivalents to human brain soluble and insoluble amyloid plaque-enriched and CAA-enriched A{beta} aggregates. Results: Lecanemab did not bind with greater affinity to the soluble fraction of A{beta} compared to aducanumab. All three antibodies were bound essentially identical quantities of A{beta} across the 18 cases and fractions (Pearson's r 0.84 -- 0.97). Antibody preference for plaque vs CAA A{beta} did not differ in soluble fractions but differed slightly in insoluble extracts. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele led to a more soluble antibody-accessible A{beta} pool in a dose-dependent manner for all three antibodies. Conclusions and Relevance: The lecanemab binding target in human brain is unlikely to be distinctly ""protofibrillar"" compared to other antibodies. Differences in antibody preference for plaque vs CAA A{beta} are unlikely to fully explain differences in ARIA-E rates. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele may plausibly increase ARIA-E risk by making antibody-accessible A{beta} more soluble. These results have implications for improving the safety and efficacy of current and future anti-amyloid antibody therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Here, we identify Tomosyn-2 as a key regulator of {beta}-cell maturation. Tomosyn-2 expression declines with age in mouse islets, coinciding with enhanced biphasic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and reduced {beta}-cell proliferation. Genetic deletion of Tomosyn-2 improves glucose tolerance, elevates plasma insulin levels, and augments islet insulin secretion, without altering systemic insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, Tomosyn-2 interacts with syntaxin-1A (Stx1A) to inhibit insulin granule exocytosis by limiting SNARE complex formation. Transcriptomic and network analyses reveal that Tomosyn-2 loss reprograms gene expression to strengthen the coupling between insulin secretion and proliferative pathways. Its deletion also reduces {beta}-cell proliferation and mass expansion, suppresses cell cycle and Akt1 signaling, and promotes {beta}-cell identity, maturation, and altered islet architecture. These findings identify Tomosyn-2 as a crucial molecular switch that orchestrates the balance between proliferation and functional maturation during postnatal {beta}-cell development.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

Since plant cells are encased in cell walls and thus immotile, their individual fate-specification program is dependent on their relative position within the organism. It is assumed that the cell wall and its mechanical properties are under surveillance, linking cell wall state to intracellular gene-regulatory networks. However, the role of these cell wall signalling pathways in plant development and the contribution of cell wall properties to cell behaviour and identity are unclear. Here, we show that control of cell wall properties is essential for the perpetuation of stem cell populations and pattering in the shoot apical meristems. The expression of pectin methylesterases (PMEs), which modify homogalacturonan methylesterification and thereby modulate cell wall mechanics, is maintained at low levels in stem cells by the stem cell specifying transcription factor WUS. Low PME expression is required for stemness, auxin patterning and stem cell-specific mechanical properties. Conversely, WUS depletion reduces wall stiffness in the meristem centre, reinforcing its role in maintaining mechanical homeostasis. Together, our findings show that WUS-mediated control of cell wall-modifying enzymes is essential for sustaining stem cell identity and SAM organization. These results demonstrat that the plant cell wall is not only involved in cell differentiation, but also exerts feedback control on developmental transitions, contributing to our understanding how the immediate physical environment is able to guide cell fate decisions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Existing state-of-the-art models for both modeling and designing protein-DNA interactions primarily rely on structural information, facing limitations in scalability and efficiency for large-scale applications. Notable methods like AlphaFold 3 and RosettaTTAFold All-Atom exist, but they are inefficient and inherently struggle at modeling conformationally unstable proteins, such as transcription factors, which arguably represent the most important class of DNA-binding proteins. Here, we present DPAC1 (DNA-Protein binding Alignment via Contrastive learning), which leverages pre-trained protein and DNA language models via a contrastive loss to align the two modalities in a high-dimensional shared latent space. DPAC not only significantly accelerates the design process compared to current structure-based methods but also demonstrates a strong ability to differentiate real binders from non-binders. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.591 on a low identity set, outperforming state-of-the-art structure-based methods. Additionally, DPAC integrates simulated annealing for the design of new protein sequences with optimized DNA binding affinity, successfully recovering binding affinity in engineered sequences by up to 20% in in silico tests. Our results highlight DPACs potential for facilitating the design and discovery of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, paving the way for advancements in genomic research and biotechnology applications.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Here, we investigate a class of proprioceptors on the Drosophila leg called hair plates. Using calcium imaging in behaving flies, we find that a hair plate on the fly coxa (CxHP8) detects the limits of anterior leg movement. Reconstructing CxHP8 axons in the connectome, we found that they are wired to excite posterior leg movement and inhibit anterior leg movement. Consistent with this connectivity, optogenetic activation of CxHP8 neurons elicited posterior postural reflexes, while silencing altered the swing-to-stance transition during walking. Finally, we use comprehensive reconstruction of peripheral morphology and downstream connectivity to predict the function of other hair plates distributed across the fly leg. Our results suggest that each hair plate is specialized to control specific sensorimotor reflexes that are matched to the joint limit it detects. They also illustrate the feasibility of predicting sensorimotor reflexes from a connectome with identified proprioceptive inputs and motor outputs.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

As deforming membranes is energetically costly, biology has developed various protein systems to accomplish this task. The mechanisms providing the force to deform bacterial membranes to initiate division remain unknown. In vivo studies have shown the condensation of FtsZ filaments into a sharp ring is required to initiate cell division, an observation mirrored in vitro with FtsZ filaments encapsulated inside liposomes. Similarly, the force for membrane deformation in many eukaryotic deforming systems arises from the local crowding of proteins on the membrane surface. As any membrane deforming system works against the membrane tension, here we modulated the amount of lipid synthesis and thus membrane tension in Bacillus subtilis to examine: 1) if the condensation of FtsZ filaments by FtsZ bundling proteins serves to overcome the cellular membrane tension to deform the membrane inward and 2) how changes to the membrane tension affect the subsequent invagination of the septum. First, we developed methods to simultaneously measure and modulate membrane tension in live cells. Next, we determined how altering the membrane tension affected the cells ability to initiate division with reduced levels of FtsZ bundling proteins. While cells depleted of 2 FtsZ bundling proteins were unable to divide, reducing membrane tension to a given threshold restored their ability to initiate division. Likewise, cells with intermediate levels of FtsZ bundling proteins required a lesser decrease in membrane tension to initiate division. We also found that reductions in membrane tension increase the rate of Z ring constriction, with the constriction rate scaling linearly with the membrane tension. Interestingly, while the constriction rate in wild-type B. subtilis is limited by FtsZ treadmilling, the rate of constriction becomes independent of FtsZs treadmilling rate when membrane tension is reduced. These experiments give two major insights: First, the filament condensation caused by FtsZ bundling proteins works to overcome membrane tension and deform the membrane inward to initiate division. Second, the rate of septal constriction is limited by membrane tension, suggesting that membrane fluctuations at the tip of the growing septa limit the rate of cell wall synthesis. Finally, our measurements allow the estimation of several physical values of cell division, such as the force required to bend the membrane, but also that the cell membrane provides only 0.1%, a small amount of surface tension relative to the entire cell envelope, indicating 99.9% of the pressure drop occurs across the cell wall. These calculations also indicate that cell division occurs via comparatively very small membrane tension fluctuations relative to the high turgor pressure that exists across the entire cell envelope.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

We took advantage of high-density Neuropixels electrodes to record large populations of neurons across layers of macaque V1 and used a state-of-the-art non-linear dimensionality reduction approach on waveform shape to delineate nine putative cell classes, 4 narrow-spiking (NS), 4 broad-spiking (BS) and 1 tri-phasic (TP). Then, we performed targeted analyses of laminar organization, spike amplitude, multichannel spatial features, functional properties, and network connectivity of these cell classes, to discover four fundamental aspects of the V1 microcircuit predicted by anatomical studies, but never fully demonstrated before in vivo: First, NS neurons were most concentrated in layer 4 and more numerous than parvalbumin positive neurons, consistent with studies of potassium channel expression in excitatory neurons in V1. Second, a large amplitude NS cell class in layer 4B was strongly direction selective, with multichannel waveforms consistent with a stellate morphology, which is a likely functional correlate of anatomical descriptions of neurons that project between V1 and MT. Third, an NS cell class in layer 4B showed robust bursting activity and strong orientation selectivity. Finally, cross-correlation analysis of neuron pairs revealed distinct functional interactions between cell classes.

However, despite dozens of tools to identify signatures in cancer samples, there is not an established metric for statistically comparing mutational signature results and quantifying the overall significance of differences among complex mixtures of signatures. To close this methodological gap, we demonstrate that a signature-agnostic metric for measuring differences in mutation spectra - the aggregate mutation spectrum distance permutation method (AMSD) - can discover differences overlooked by signature analysis. First, we reanalyzed a study of carcinogen exposure in mice, identifying statistically significant shifts in mutation spectra caused by eleven of twenty tested carcinogens. Only three carcinogens were previously reported to induce distinct mutation signatures, suggesting that many carcinogens perturb mutagenesis by altering the composition of endogenous signatures rather than introducing unique signatures. Next, we used human tumor data to determine whether patient ancestry has a measurable impact on tumor mutation spectra, finding significant ancestry-associated differences across ten cancer types: for example, Africans have elevated SBS4 in lung adenocarcinomas, East Asians have elevated SBS16 in esophageal and liver cancers plus elevated SBS10a/b in uterine and colorectal cancers, and Europeans have elevated SBS17b in esophageal cancers plus elevated SBS2/13 in bladder cancers. These examples suggest that AMSD is a robust tool for detecting differences among tumor mutation spectra, complementing signature-based approaches and enabling the discovery of environmental and genetic influences on mutagenesis in large datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

In Arabidopsis, the RNA-binding protein RBP47b is a canonical SG marker, yet its functional contribution to thermotolerance remains unresolved. Here, we combined mTurboID proximity labeling with multi-omics profiling to define the RBP47b interactome and its physiological impact. mTurboID identified a stress-specific enrichment of 40S ribosomal subunits within RBP47b SGs, implicating these condensates in translational control. Surprisingly, quadruple mutant plants lacking all four RBP47 paralogues (rbp47abcc') displayed enhanced survival, attenuated growth delay, and faster recovery of photosynthetic efficiency after severe heat stress. Integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses revealed that this gain of thermotolerance is associated with (i) accelerated re-initiation of translation, (ii) constitutively elevated jasmonate and oxylipin pools, and (iii) reduced ROS accumulation during heat and recovery. We conclude that the RBP47 family acts as a negative regulator of heat tolerance by sequestering 40S subunits and limiting translational restart; loss of these SG scaffolds pre-primes jasmonate-dependent detoxification pathways and expedites proteome rebuilding, thereby conferring superior thermotolerance.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

Preserving locomotive capacity was likely essential for survival during the human hunter-gatherer period but surprisingly little is known about the molecular effects of energy deficit on human skeletal muscle, which is a key tissue for locomotion and metabolic health. Here we show that a 5-day 78% reduction in energy availability with concomitant aerobic exercise in healthy men leads to a profound modulation of skeletal muscle phenotype alongside increases in fat oxidation at rest and during exercise and a 2.1 {+/-}0.8 kg loss of fat free mass and 0.8 {+/-}0.6 kg of fat mass. We used stable isotope (D2O) labelling and peptide mass spectrometry to investigate the abundance and turnover rates of individual proteins. Abundance (1469 proteins) and synthesis rate (736 proteins) data discovered a shift toward a more oxidative phenotype and reorganisation of cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix structure during energy deficit. Mitochondrial components: TCA, electron transport chain and beta-oxidation, were prominently represented amongst proteins that increased in abundance and synthesis rate, as well as proteins related to mitochondrial proteostasis, remodelling and quality-control such as BDH1 and LONP1. Changes in muscle metabolic pathways occurred alongside a reduction in extracellular matrix proteins, which may counteract the age-related muscle fibrosis. Our results suggest that muscle metabolic pathways are not only preserved but positively affected during periods of concomitant low energy availability and exercise.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

In extreme cases, like for photosynthetic organisms, their energy source, light, can fluctuate dramatically in intensity over timescales of seconds to hours. While various photosynthetic electron flows (EF) are crucial for maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis, how EFs are modulated to respond to dynamic energy intake remains unclear. Here, we show in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that each EF is best suited to a specific domain of energetic fluctuation periodicity for which it can support the cells energetic needs, which we term bandwidth. By systematically exposing cells to a range of light periodicities, we show that while cyclic EF has a large bandwidth, pseudo-cyclic EF (PCEF) can only sustain the cells energetic needs for fast light fluctuations, and that the interplay between the chloroplast and the mitochondria (CMEF) has a limited bandwidth. We further show that the bandwidths of PCEF and CMEF, specialized for dynamic lights, are related to their capacity to generate ATP and protect the photosynthetic apparatus. Finally, we show that in wild-type cells, the activity level of PCEF and CMEF matches their bandwidth, and we propose that cells tune the relative activity of each AEF depending on the light fluctuation frequency. Our work opens an avenue of research to characterize the molecular mechanisms required for phototrophic growth in complex and dynamic energetic landscapes. It further provides a generalizable framework for understanding the physiological importance of molecular mechanisms in a dynamic environment.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

This process has been interpreted as a form of active sensing and is associated with faster responses and improved perceptual accuracy. While converging evidence suggests that respiration also shapes interoceptive processing at both neural and behavioural levels, it remains unclear whether individuals actively adjust their breathing to optimize interoceptive performance. In this study, we examined whether healthy participants modulated their respiration during an interoceptive (heartbeat discrimination) and an exteroceptive (tactile detection) task. We analysed respiration both in terms of time-locked activity and inter-trial phase coherence relative to stimulus onset and assessed their relationship with perceptual accuracy. Our results demonstrated that participants systematically adjust their breathing in both amplitude and phase, synchronizing respiration to the anticipated (i.e., cued) onset of stimuli in both tasks. Crucially, task performance was enhanced during exhalation compared to inhalation, suggesting that respiratory modulation supports the perception of both interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.

Significance statementThis study reveals that humans not only synchronize their breathing to anticipated external and internal stimuli, but also perform better when perceiving them during exhalation. By showing that respiration is modulated in both interoceptive and exteroceptive contexts, our findings extend the concept of active sensing to internal bodily awareness. This has important implications for understanding the dynamic interplay between physiology and perception and may guide interventions aimed at improving clinical outcomes in conditions where interoception is disrupted.","NA","biorxiv",1747951786661

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1747951786661

In this retrospective review, we evaluated the landscape of clinical trials (CTx) registered on ClinicalTrials.gov for the consideration of potential factors contributing to human heterogeneity in their design and analyses. Among CTx registered from 1995-2024, we observed a trend toward equality in including female participants, but lack of reporting of sex as a biological variable. Limited demographic diversity was observed with [~]93% White population participation. There was a substantial divergence in the diagnostic criteria and a wide range of tools employed to measure CC. Lastly, few studies considered cancer type and stage as clinical variables. Overall, a substantial gap remains in our knowledge of CC in non-white and female populations. Ultimately, these underreported data across CC CTx complicate the comparison and interpretation of CTx results, both within understudied populations and in specific cancer types. The current evolution of knowledge and new methodologies used for CC assessment reinforce the need for a constant revision of the CC consensus definition and diagnosis criteria to align with current advances in our understanding of human heterogeneity in CC.","NA","medrxiv",1747951786661

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.
