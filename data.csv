Average reported losses since the preceding spring exceeded 60%, with substantial variation among operations. Many colonies were still actively collapsing in January, 2025, when pooled and individual samples were collected then screened for levels of known honey bee pathogens and parasites. Deformed wing virus strains A and B, along with Acute bee paralysis virus, were found at unusually high levels, either in pooled colony samples or in individual bees exhibiting shaking behaviors and morbidity.

Differences between these two analyses suggest that direct collections of morbid bees provide a superior diagnostic for causal viruses, a suggestion borne out by confirmation of symptoms and morbidity following isolation and new inoculations. Since these viruses are known to be vectored by parasitic Varroa mites, mites from collapsed colonies were in turn screened for resistance to amitraz, a critical miticide used widely by beekeepers. Miticide resistance was found in all collected Varroa, underscoring the urgent need for new control strategies for this parasite. While viruses are a likely end-stage cause of colony death, other stressors such as nutritional stress and agrochemicals may have also played significant roles.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906706

However recent findings indicate that approaches to identify enhancers may not capture the full repertoire of active enhancers in mammalian genomes. Here, we combine massively parallel enhancer assays with chromatin structure and transcriptome profiling to functionally annotate enhancers genome-wide in human induced pluripotent stem cells. We find that a substantial fraction ([~]40%) of accessible chromatin regions with enhancer function lack key features associated with active enhancers, including the active enhancer mark histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and enhancer-associated RNAs. Perturbation of this class of non-canonical enhancers by CRISPR-mediated epigenome editing results in decreased levels of target gene expression and, in one instance, loss of pluripotent stem cell characteristics. Collectively, our data demonstrate enhancer activity for a class of gene regulatory elements that had until now only been associated with a neutral or inactive status, challenging current models of enhancer function.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906706

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

However, analyzing spatial transcriptomics data presents unique challenges due to their high dimensionality and complexity. Several competitive tools have emerged, each aiming to integrate spatial dependencies into their workflow. Yet, the overall performance of these approaches remains constrained by limitations in prediction accuracy and compatibility with specific data types. Here, we introduce the third version of the KODAMA algorithm, specifically tailored for spatial transcriptomics analysis. This upgraded version incorporates a novel approach that effectively reduces data dimensionality while preserving spatial information. At its core, the KODAMA algorithm employs parallel iterations that enforce spatial constraints throughout an embedded clustering process. Our method provides the flexibility to simultaneously analyze multiple samples, streamlining analysis workflows. Additionally, it extends beyond traditional 2D analysis to accommodate multidimensional datasets, including 3D spatial information. KODAMA seamlessly integrates into various pipelines, such as Seurat and Giotto. Extensive evaluations of KODAMA on 10x Visium, Visium HD, and image-based 3D datasets demonstrate its high accuracy in spatial domain prediction. Comparative analyses against alternative dimensionality reduction techniques and spatial analysis tools consistently validate and highlight KODAMAs superior performance in unraveling the spatial organization of cellular components across both single and integrated tissue samples.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906706

By integrating fluid-specific exercise signatures with tissue and disease atlases, we delineated the contribution of tissues and associations to various diseases. Network analysis across body fluids elucidated coordinated remodeling in the extracellular matrix and immune activation orchestrating exercise-induced networks. Many exercise-responsive plasma proteins were robust across age, sex, and exercise modalities, indicating a conserved systemic signature. Integration with genetic data established exercise-regulated proteins as modulators of metabolic traits and identified over 200 targeted by approved drugs, highlighting their impact on disease-relevant pathways.

However, current mutational signatures do not distinguish the two independent steps that generate SBSs: the initial DNA damage followed by erroneous repair. To address this modelling gap we developed DAMUTA, a hierarchical Bayesian probabilistic model that infers separate signatures for each process, and captures their sample-specific interaction. We applied DAMUTA to 18,974 pan-cancer whole genome sequencing mutation catalogues from 23 cancer types and show that tissue-specificity in mutation patterns is driven largely by variability in damage processes. We also show that misrepair processes are predictive of DNA damage response deficiencies. Unlike existing approaches, DAMUTA distinguishes damage from misrepair contributions, and we demonstrate significant improvements over a mutational-burden baseline or signatures from the COSMIC database. Our analysis reveals a shared pan-cancer pattern of early clonal transition-mutations which shifts to a more uniform substitution pattern consistent with increased reliance on translesion synthesis for damage tolerance. DAMUTA thus generates a compact set of signatures which resolves redundancies of current signature models, disentangles the effects of DNA damage and misrepair processes, and facilitates improved stratification of tumours, while providing a framework towards a unified pan-cancer model of the cellular response to DNA damage.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906706

Central to their energy metabolism is a membrane [ndash]bound, sodium-translocating methyltransferase complex: the Na+ tetrahydromethanopterin:CoM-S [ndash]methyltransferase (Mtr complex), which catalyzes the methyl transfer between two methanogen specific cofactors. This exergonic methyl transfer step is coupled with a vectorial sodium ion transport from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior and is the only energy conserving step in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Here, we present a 2.1 [A] single-particle cryo-EM structure of the full Mtr complex from Methanosarcina mazei. Our structural model encompasses the entire complex, reveals the arrangement of archaea phospholipids, the architecture of the sodium ion binding site, and the structure and interactions of all catalytic subunits. Most strikingly, we discover and characterize MtrI, a previously unannotated small open reading frame (small ORF), encoded protein (<100 aa) conserved across the order of Methanosarcinales. MtrI binds to the cytoplasmic domain of MtrA in response to oxygen exposure, suggesting a role in oxygen stress response and protection. By binding on top of the sodium channel and anchoring to the cobalamid cofactor in MtrA's cytoplasmic domain, MtrI might prevent sodium leakage and inhibit MtrA-CoM turnover. These findings offer new insights into methanogen energy conservation and uncover a potential adaptive response to oxygen exposure, expanding our understanding of methanogen survival strategies under oxidative stress.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906706

However, with the growth of complex lab experiments, large datasets, many analytical tools, and expansive literature, biomedical research is increasingly constrained by repetitive and fragmented workflows that slow discovery and limit innovation, underscoring the need for a fundamentally new way to scale scientific expertise. Here, we introduce Biomni, a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to autonomously execute a wide spectrum of research tasks across diverse biomedical subfields. To systematically map the biomedical action space, Biomni first employs an action discovery agent to create the first unified agentic environment -- mining essential tools, databases, and protocols from tens of thousands of publications across 25 biomedical domains. Built on this foundation, Biomni features a generalist agentic architecture that integrates large language model (LLM) reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code-based execution, enabling it to dynamically compose and carry out complex biomedical workflows -- entirely without relying on predefined templates or rigid task flows. Systematic benchmarking demonstrates that Biomni achieves strong generalization across heterogeneous biomedical tasks -- including causal gene prioritization, drug repurposing, rare disease diagnosis, microbiome analysis, and molecular cloning -- without any task-specific prompt tuning. Real-world case studies further showcase Biomni's ability to interpret complex, multi-modal biomedical datasets and autonomously generate experimentally testable protocols. Biomni envisions a future where virtual AI biologists operate alongside and augment human scientists to dramatically enhance research productivity, clinical insight, and healthcare. Biomni is ready to use at https://biomni.stanford.edu, and we invite scientists to explore its capabilities, stress-test its limits, and co-create the next era of biomedical discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906706

One of the major challenges to understanding the role of condensates is the lack of technologies to map condensate-scale protein architecture at subcompartmental or nanoscale resolution. To address this, we introduce HCR-Proxy, a proximity labelling technique that couples Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)-based signal amplification with in situ proximity biotinylation (Proxy), enabling proteomic profiling of RNA-proximal proteomes at subcompartmental resolution. We benchmarked HCR-Proxy using nascent pre-rRNA targets to investigate the distinct proteomic signatures of the nucleolar subcompartments and to uncover a spatial logic of protein partitioning shaped by RNA sequence. Our results demonstrate HCR-Proxys ability to provide spatially-resolved maps of RNA interactomes within the nucleolus, offering new insights into the molecular organisation and compartmentalisation of condensates. This subcompartment-specific nucleolar proteome profiling enabled integration with deep learning frameworks, which effectively confirmed a sequence-encoded basis for protein partitioning across nested condensate subcompartments, characterised by antagonistic gradients in charge, length, and RNA-binding domains. HCR-Proxy thus provides a scalable platform for spatially resolved RNA interactome discovery, bridging transcript localisation with proteomic context in native cellular environments.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1749074906706

Schizophrenia has been associated with impaired nervous system development and an excitation/inhibition imbalance in the prefrontal cortex. On a molecular level, schizophrenia is moderately heritable and genetically complex. Hundreds of risk genes have been identified, spanning a heterogeneous landscape dominated by loci that confer relatively small risk. Bioinformatic analyses of genetic associations point to a limited set of neurons, mainly excitatory cortical neurons, but other analyses suggest the importance of astrocytes and microglia. To understand different cell type roles in schizophrenia and reveal novel cell-type specific aetiologically relevant perturbations in schizophrenia, our study integrated genetic analysis with single nucleus RNA-seq of 536,618 nuclei from postmortem samples of dorsal prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 8/9) of 43 cases with schizophrenia and 42 neurotypical controls. We found no significant difference in cell type abundance. Gene expression in excitatory layer 2-3 intra-telencephalic neurons had the greatest number of differentially expressed transcripts and, together with excitatory deep layer intra-telencephalic neurons, conferred most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. Most differential expression of genes was found in specific cell types and was dominated by down-regulated transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets including transmembrane transport, mitochondrial function, protein folding, and cell-cell signaling whereas up-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets related to RNA processing, including RNA splicing in neurons. Co-regulation network analysis identified 40 schizophrenia-relevant programs across 13 cell types. A gene program largely shared between neuronal subtypes, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes was significantly enriched for schizophrenia risk, supporting an aetiological role for perturbed protein modification, ion transport, and mitochondrial function. These results were largely consistent with cell-type expression quantitative trait locus and transcriptome-wide association analyses. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing results, most prominently mitochondrial dysfunction, had multiple points of convergence with proteomic and long-read RNA sequencing results from samples from the same donors. Our study integrates genetic analysis with transcriptomics to reveal novel cell-type specific aetiologically relevant perturbations in schizophrenia.","NA","medrxiv",1749074906706

Here, we report the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein persistence in the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in otherwise healthy individuals, a set of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and a case of a 60-year-old man who developed a new onset of lupus nephritis seven months following mild COVID-19 disease. We have identified that N protein persistence in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) did not correlate with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood but is associated with significantly increased secretion of type I interferons (IFN) and presence of tubuloreticular structures in peripheral leukocytes. We further demonstrate that the N protein colocalizes in the mitochondrial fraction of PBMCs from individuals positive for N protein alongside mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). In vitro expression of the N protein in a monocytic cell line showed that the N protein itself was directly capable of interacting with MAVS in the absence of viral RNA, and this interaction was enhanced if the cell was exposed to oxidative stress. We show that the type I IFN signature in the presence of N protein expression was MAVS, but not STING signaling pathway-dependent. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the onset and promotion of type I IFN signature after COVID-19; in our model, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein can independently trigger sustained type I IFN production via direct activation of MAVS and its spontaneous oligomerization. This long-lasting type I IFN generation may create a chronic inflammatory milieu, favoring autoimmunity with SLE-like symptoms in susceptible individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906706

Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) already supplies nitrogen to legume crops and several avenues of research are underway to extend it to non-legume crops. In maize (Zea mays), aerial roots have been shown to contribute to BNF in some varieties, and both having many aerial roots and large aerial roots contributes to the fixation trait. However, much of the genetics controlling aerial root number and size is still unknown. Here we validate and quantify BNF in maize varieties from Southern Mexico under controlled conditions and evaluate a population of double haploids derived from the elite inbred PHZ51 crossed with these varieties. We find that most aerial root traits (root number, nodes with roots, root size) are reasonably heritable (h2 0.5-0.75) and generally uncorrelated with each other. QTL mapping identifies 5 QTL each affecting nodes with aerial roots and aerial root number per node; in both cases all but 1 QTL show an increase from the landrace allele. We also identify 11 QTL for aerial root diameter, with most positive QTL coming from PHZ51. Between the two populations, only a few QTL overlap, indicating a presumably high diversity of genes affecting aerial root morphology in landrace populations. Combining the best QTL into elite material may provide a path toward meaningful levels of BNF for maize, and additional work is needed to determine how viable this approach will be in field settings.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906706

We hypothesize that semantic memories are altered in a similar way when retrieval draws on a core dimension of conceptual knowledge: semantic granularity. Each level, from accessing a concept via unique perceptual features to its thematic context, shapes the retrieval route used to access semantic memories. This study tests whether semantic granularities used to retrieve a concept influences its reactivation during later recognition. Human participants learned and retrieved novel word-image pairs while undergoing fMRI. Following encoding, items were retrieved via one of three semantic levels: item, category, or theme. Later, participants accessed the memories in recognition and cued recall tests. Although behavioral memory performance was matched across conditions, neural activity during recognition varied based on prior retrieval history. Recognition patterns could be classified according to prior retrieval granularity in ventral temporal cortex for both remembered and non-remembered concepts, and in the hippocampus for remembered concepts only. A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed bilateral clusters along the ventral visual stream, from early visual cortex to fusiform gyrus, where retrieval history was decodable. Representational similarity analyses showed that category-level retrieval increased pattern consistency in early visual cortex and pattern reactivation in ventral temporal cortex, while item-level retrieval enhanced memory trace distinctiveness in visual word form area. Theme-level retrieval increased activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that how we access a concept leaves a detectable trace on subsequent neural reactivation, subtly shaping how conceptual knowledge is organized in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906706

Using global untargeted lipidomics and quantitative proteomics, we analyzed A549-ACE2 cells infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529) var-iants and compared them to cells infected with the ancestral WA1 strain.

By coupling cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and functional mutagenesis, we find that males of the silkmoth Bombyx mori distinguish between two quasi-identical compounds -bombykol, an alcohol, and bombykal, an aldehyde- by establishing a reversible covalent bond between the pheromone receptor and bombykal. Bombykol, instead, binds to the same receptor through hydrogen bonds, with significantly lower potency. The unique ability of aldehydes to establish a reversible covalent bond allows moths to unequivocally distinguish between compounds that differ only in the presence of a single hydrogen atom.

While the majority of paralogous TFs are dispersed across different chromosomes, some remain clustered raising the question of whether genomic proximity confers any evolutionary advantage for TF clusters. To address this, we investigated a [~]1 Mbp locus containing two ETS family paralogs, Ets1 and Fli1. Using a sub-diffraction sequential imaging technique called Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA), we traced the 3D organization of this region in single alleles of T cells from genetically engineered mice with targeted deletions of key regulatory elements. In wild-type T cells, the predominant chromatin conformation spatially links Ets1 to its proximal super-enhancer, segregating Ets1 from Fli1. This topology correlates with high Ets1 and low Fli1 expression. Deletion of the Ets1 super-enhancer abolishes this configuration, triggering locus-wide architectural rewiring that increases Ets1-Fli1 promoter-promoter interactions and subsequently the co-expression of two genes within individual cells. Remarkably, this compensatory interaction bypasses insulated chromatin domains, sustaining Ets1 levels necessary for T cell development despite enhancer loss. Our results reveal that genomic clustering of TF paralogs enables dynamic architectural plasticity: while a super-enhancer fine-tunes paralog expression balance in wild-type contexts, its deletion unmasks latent promoter-driven coordination, suggesting that proximity safeguards functional redundancy and transcriptional resilience critical for cellular fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

Much effort has been devoted to understanding TF activity in different tissues and how tissue-specificity is achieved. However, ultimately gene regulation occurs at the single cell level and the recent explosion in the availability of single cell gene expression data now makes it possible to understand TF activity at this granular level of resolution.

Here, we leverage a large collection of Human Cell Atlas (HCA) single cell data to explore TF activity by examining cell-type and tissue-specific sets of target genes, or regulons. We compile a regulon atlas, CellRegulon, and map the activity of TFs in an extensive set of healthy adult and foetal tissues spanning hundreds of cell types. Using CellRegulon, we describe dynamic patterns of co-regulation, associate TF-modules with different cellular functions and characterise the distribution of active TFs and TF families across cell types. We show that CellRegulon can link disease gene expression signatures to cell types and TFs relevant to the disease. Finally, using a newly generated multiome dataset of the adult lung, we show how CellRegulon can be extended into an enhancer-gene regulatory network (eGRN) to improve cell-type associations with genetic risk loci for diseases, such as childhood onset asthma, COPD and IPF, and to identify high risk gene modules. Our database for easy download and interactive exploration allows researchers to understand key gene modules activated at cell type transitions and will therefore be valuable for tasks such as cell type engineering (https://www.cellregulondb.org).","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), the development of place selectivity, manifested as place fields, is believed to result from dendritic integration of spatially distributed inputs combined with behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP). BTSP involves dendritic spikes that temporally regulate synaptic potentiation and depotentiation. However, the role of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synaptic distributions in the emergence of place specificity in CA1 PNs remains unclear, due to the lack of detailed synaptic reconstructions in vivo. Here, we present full synaptic reconstructions from individual CA1 PNs in the mouse hippocampus, revealing that these neurons receive approximately 10,000-15,000 E synapses and 900-1,400 I synapses. Computational modeling of biologically relevant E and I synaptic distributions shows that spatial tuning is preserved with co-tuned, spatially clustered E synapses, but disrupted when E distributions are randomized. Moreover, synapse clustering has a different contribution to spatial tuning in apical vs. basal domains. Our results reveal a complex and finely-tuned interplay between presynaptic input patterns and the spatial organization of their postsynaptic targets in dictating neuronal output in CA1 PNs.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

In this study, we propose that regions of the language network are coupled to one another through subspaces of shared linguistic features. To test this idea, we developed a model-based connectivity framework to quantify stimulus-driven, feature-specific functional connectivity between language areas during natural language comprehension. Using fMRI data acquired while subjects listened to spoken narratives, we tested three types of features extracted from a unified neural network model for speech and language: low-level acoustic embeddings, mid-level speech embeddings, and high-level language embeddings. Our modeling framework enabled us to quantify the stimulus features that drive connectivity between regions: early auditory areas were coupled to intermediate language areas via lower-level acoustic and speech features; in contrast, higher-order language and default-mode regions were predominantly coupled through more abstract language features. We observed a clear progression of feature-specific connectivity from early auditory to lateral temporal areas, advancing from acoustic connectivity to speech- and finally to language-driven connectivity. These findings suggest that regions of the language network are coupled through feature-specific communication channels to facilitate efficient and context-sensitive language processing.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

One of these approaches is close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR), a type of method that uses genetic data to identify kin pairs and estimates population size from these pairs. Although CKMR methods are promising, a major limitation to using them more broadly is a lack of CKMR models that can deal with spatial heterogeneity both in population density and sample effort. We introduce a simulation-based approach to CKMR that uses spatially explicit individual-based simulation in concert with a deep convolutional neural network to estimate population sizes. Using extensive simulation, we show that our method, CKMRnn, is highly accurate, even in the face of spatial heterogeneity, and demonstrate that it can account for potential confounders such as unknown population histories.

They are positively associated with inflammatory diseases within the human microbiome, yet their mechanisms for interacting with the human host and contributing to diseases remain unknown. This study investigated interactions between a Saccharibacterium (Nanosynbacter lyticus), its host-bacteria (Schaalia odontolytica), and oral epithelial cells. The host-bacteria induced proinflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells, while Saccharibacteria were immune silent. Remarkably, Saccharibacteria dampened cytokine responses to host-bacteria during coinfection. This effect was driven by Saccharibacteria-induced clustering of TLR2 receptors, a process likely facilitated by type IV, ultimately leading to reduced TLR2-mediated cytokine signalling. High resolution imaging showed that Saccharibacteria were endocytosed by oral epithelial cells, and colocalized with endosome markers, eventually trafficking to lysosomes. Moreover, a subset of the Saccharibacteria survive endocytosis long-term, and retains their capability to reinfect host-bacteria, highlighting a mechanism for persistence in the oral microbiome and a vital role in mammalian immune system modulation.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

Here, we show that the histone variant H2A.Z is a novel sex-specific regulator of AD in human patients and AD model mice. Specifically, H2A.Z binding in chromatin declines in female and increases in male AD patients, indicating opposite patterns of AD-related H2A.Z dysregulation each sex. These sex differences were recapitulated in the 5xFAD model of AD, in which females accumulated H2A.Z at early disease stages and lost H2A.Z as the disease progressed, suggesting that H2A.Z occupancy shifts with advancing disease. Males showed no change in H2A.Z binding in early disease, but exhibited increased binding as disease progressed, albeit to a lesser extent than females. Consistent with sex-specific H2A.Z dysregulation, H2A.Z depletion produced sex-specific changes in gene expression, whereby H2A.Z was more repressive in female than in male mice and in 5xFAD than in WT males, suggesting that H2A.Zs role in transcription varies with sex and disease. Moreover, H2A.Z depletion improved memory and AD pathology in females, while impairing memory and worsening pathology in male mice. Together, these data suggest that H2A.Z is protective in males and detrimental in females with AD, with key implications for sex-specific therapeutic targeting of chromatin factors.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

These variations can render retention time prediction models inaccurate and dramatically reduce the value of predictions for identification, validation, and DIA spectral library generation. To date, mitigation of these issues has been attempted through calibration or by training bespoke models for specific experimental setups, with only partial success. We here demonstrate that transfer learning can successfully overcome these limitations by leveraging pre-trained model parameters. Remarkably, this approach can even fit highly performant models to substantially different peptide modifications and LC conditions than those on which the model was originally trained. This impressive adaptability of transfer learning makes it a highly robust solution for accurate peptide retention time prediction across a very wide variety of imaginable proteomics workflows.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

Here, we introduce a new idtracker.ai that reframes multi-animal tracking as a representation learning problem rather than a classification task. Specifically, we apply contrastive learning to image pairs that, based on video structure, are known to belong to the same or different identities. This approach maps animal images into a representation space where they cluster by animal identity.

However, targeting specific cellular features within large, complex organs remains challenging. Here we present a series of technical improvements significantly enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of the Serial Lift-Out and SOLIST (Serialized On-grid Lift-In Sectioning for Tomography) procedures that are revolutionizing the field. We were able to extend the cryo-FIBSEM session from 24 hours to 5 days without interruptions. In addition, we describe a modified silver-plated EasyLiftTM needle that eliminates the need of the copper or gold block between the original tungsten needle and the sample. Moreover, we describe a strategy that significantly reduces curtaining effects. Finally, we report a precise routine to target a lamella with a precision of approximately 1 micrometer in X,Y and Z. Together, these modifications considerably reduce contamination risk and preparation time, making cryo-lift-out techniques more accessible for routine structural biology applications on any type of tissue. Here, we demonstrate the power of our technique by targeting several specific wall structures that are of crucial importance for root function in plants and that were previously inaccessible to cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). High-pressure freezing (HPF) of plant tissues presents unique challenges for cryo-electron microscopy sample preparation due to the overall sample size, the individual cells size, their rigid cell wall and finally, their large vacuoles, which contain large amounts of rather diluted water solutions compared to cytosol. The internal root structures targeted are the Casparian strip (CS), suberin lamellae (SL), as well as secondary wall of xylem vessels, requiring reaching a targeting precision of 5 micrometers in a 3 millimeters long and 80-120 micrometers thick root tip. Our technological improvements for the cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) workflow enabled successful, targeted cryo-ET in plant roots. We noticed that, despite ice formation in vacuoles and to some degree in the cytosol, the plasma membranes and cell walls are remarkably well preserved, providing stunning insights into the native, hydrated nano-structure of plant cell walls, previously only observable with contrasting agents and in a dehydrated state.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

However, therapeutic resistance, especially in the metastatic context, limits its long-term efficacy. While significant progress has been made in elucidating mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance, the role of cell-to-cell communication in modulating treatment response remains largely unexplored. Here, we combined microfluidic technology with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to directly compare the transcriptional responses of cells in communication versus those in isolation. Upon dox treatment, we observed robust activation of the p53 pathway in communicating cells, whereas this response was markedly impaired in isolated cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of caveolar-mediated endocytosis mimics the loss of p53 activation, further implicating this pathway in the communication-dependent regulation of chemotherapy response. This finding uncovers a previously unrecognized and essential role for paracrine signalling in mediating p53-dependent responses to chemotherapy. Our study highlights the critical importance of cell-to-cell communication in shaping therapeutic outcomes and opens new avenues for understanding and potentially overcoming chemotherapy resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1749074906707

However, the associated molecular changes across endocrine and non-endocrine compartments remain largely unexplored. Here, using longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) on islets from C57BL/6 mice subjected to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding for 8, 16, and 24 weeks, along with age-matched controls on regular chow, we mapped dynamic changes in islet cell composition and transcriptional states. Beta cells demonstrated pronounced stress-induced reprogramming, with the emergence of proliferative and dysfunctional subsets. Alpha and delta cell fractions declined under HFD, despite increased polyhormonal biosynthesis, suggesting functional rather than numerical adaptation. Immune profiling showed robust expansion of proinflammatory M1 macrophages and upregulation of NF-{kappa}B and chemotaxis pathways, particularly at 16 weeks. Notably, cell-cell communication analyses revealed diet-specific disruption in signaling networks. Under HFD conditions, intercellular communication among beta cells, macrophages, and delta cells was markedly altered, leading to the disruption of key signaling pathways such as the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). Notably, C-C motif chemokine ligand 27A (Ccl27a) expression and chromatin accessibility were significantly altered in a distinct subpopulation of beta cells under HFD condition, indicative of a niche-specific regulatory mechanism. Integration with human islet datasets from obese and type 2 diabetes (T2D) donors confirmed conserved shifts in beta cell identity and immune activation. This study presents a comprehensive high-resolution atlas of islet remodeling under metabolic stress, identifying key communication nodes and transcriptional programs pertinent to T2D pathogenesis.

In angiosperms, a double fertilization process results in the formation of a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm, both of which develop within maternal sporophytic integuments. Thus, the seed of angiosperms is a combined structure of three genetically distinct components: embryo, endosperm, and maternal integuments. It has long been assumed that the maternal plant influences embryo development, but there is limited molecular evidence for a direct pathway through which the maternal sporophyte aYects embryogenesis. Here we show that secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated upon exosome impairment lead to embryo abortion through a maternal sporophytic eYect. Depletion of the core subunit of the RNA-processing exosome RRP45B (CER7) causes globular embryo arrest connected to ectopic post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Seed coat expression of CER7 suppresses seed abortion, demonstrating a maternal sporophytic control of embryo development through an RNA decay safeguard pathway. Our data support a model in which a primary siRNA trigger originates in the maternal integuments of the cer7 seed coat and drives PTGS amplification in reproductive tissues after fertilization, ultimately leading to seed abortion. In addition, our genetic and molecular data suggest that overloading of AGO1 with siRNAs impairs miRNA function, likely leading to embryo arrest. Our data highlight the complex interplay between maternal and embryonic gene regulation, reinforcing the importance of controlled RNA decay in plant development.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

It is unclear how hallucinatory proneness changes across the lifespan, with prior questionnaire-based studies showing mixed results. As factors such as multi-sensory acuity loss and relatively increased reliance on prior knowledge may increase as we age, and these are considered risk factors for hallucination proneness, we hypothesised that reported decreases in hallucinations might reflect stigma-related underreporting. We therefore sought to measure hallucination proneness in 44 healthy adults spanning the adult lifespan (younger age group; n=22; age 19-39 years, mean 27.2 {+/-} 5.5; older age group n=22; age 59-79 years, mean 68.0 {+/-} 5.8), quantifying the tendency to experience complex and simple hallucinations in an experimental environment designed to elicit hallucinations. We find that reports of complex hallucinations (those representing objects, scenes, etc) are lower in older adults than in younger adults, both in real time and retrospectively. None of our measured cognitive or sensory measures (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, perceptual reorganisation, imagery vividness, memory inhibition, and suggestibility) mediate this relationship. We conclude that reduced complex hallucination proneness appears normative in ageing, and that experiencing hallucinations in older individuals may signal underlying pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

EnrichMap is demonstrated to be generalisable across a variety of ST platforms, including Visium, Xenium, MERFISH and imaging mass cytometry, maintaining consistent performance despite differences in spatial resolution and detection chemistry. Our method offers a platform-agnostic, spatially and biologically meaningful representation of gene set activity across complex tissue landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

In the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, the rhythm generated by a molecular pacemaker is converted into a global transcriptional oscillation by the central regulator RpaA. Mutants in RpaA and other components have been instrumental in elucidating the clocks molecular architecture and physiological role. Extensive evidence suggests that one of the central functions of circadian regulation is to prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during nighttime. However, circadian mutants are unable to grow under natural day/night cycles and require constant illumination, hindering our ability to study the clock function during the night, a phase where circadian regulation is critical for redox homeostasis. Here, we show that the darkness lethality phenotype of circadian mutants can be overcome by high CO2 levels. When grown under a 3% CO2 atmosphere, RpaA-null mutants exhibited growth rates similar to the wt. An analysis of the ROS levels under different CO2 and light intensity conditions revealed carbon scarcity to be the most significant contributor to redox stress. Nighttime ROS accumulation can be modulated by CO2 abundance, an observation that will allow the characterization of heretofore lethal mutants in circadian regulation. The dispensability of the circadian clock in a high CO2 environment suggests that the clock may have evolved as an adaptation to the decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels that occurred after the Great Oxygenation Events, in the Paleoproterozoic era.

IMPORTANCECyanobacterial circadian clocks are considered essential for survival under natural day/night conditions, and many circadian mutants are lethal under diel cycles. Results presented here challenge this assumption, showing that these mutants grow normally when CO2 is abundant. This suggests that the major adaptive role of the clock is to manage the redox stress caused by carbon limitation. By separating the effects of carbon availability from circadian control, we identify a key environmental factor that shaped the evolution of biological timekeeping. Using high CO2 to bypass clock dependency will allow the study of circadian function in otherwise lethal mutants. These findings reframe the clock as a specific adaptation to atmospheric carbon, stressing its key role in the regulation of the redox balance.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

Independent participants evaluated the moment-to-moment presence of twenty moral dimensions in the film. Correlation and consensus cluster analyses revealed four independent main moral dimensions: virtue, vice, hierarchy, and rebellion. While each dimension exhibited unique neural activation patterns, the temporoparietal junction and inferior parietal lobe were activated across all types of moral inference.

Magnetoencephalog- raphy (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that captures brain activity at high tem- poral resolution. However, its spatial resolution is insufficient to accurately localize neural activation, and thus cannot capture the interactive nature of human brain ac- tivity. To resolve this issue, various MEG source estimation models have been pro- posed. In particular, models incorporating prior information from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which offers superior spatial resolution, have improved source estimation accuracy. However, these models typically ignore the similarity of activity across different brain areas, and still fall short in tracking dynamic brain activity pattern at a sufficient spatial scale. In this study, we developed a block-structured model that integrates information about functional areas and the interareal relationships of the human brain into MEG source estimation based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We evaluated our model performance using simulation data with sequential activation across multiple brain areas. Results showed that our model outperformed conventional approaches in source estimation accuracy, suggesting that incorporating the functional areal information and inter-areal relationships may enhance MEG source estimation, enabling human neuroimaging at high spatiotemporal resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

Along with laboratory characterisation and electron microscopy, we generated a complete Noodlococcus genome sequence using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore data. The genome consisted of a single, circular, 2732108 bp chromosome that shared 97.5% Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) with the Kocuria rhizophila type strain TA68. We identified genomic features involved in replication (oriC), carotenoid synthesis (crt), and genome defence (CRISPR-Cas), and discovered four novel mobile elements (ISKrh4-7). Despite its environmental ubiquity and relevance to food production, bioremediation, and human medicine, there have been few genomic studies of the Kocuria genus. We conducted a comparative, phylogenetic, and pangenomic examination of all 257 publicly available Kocuria genomes, with a particular focus on the 56 that were identified as K. rhizophila. We found that there are two phylogenetically distinct clades of K. rhizophila, with within-clade ANI values of 96.7-100.0% and between-clade values of 89.5-90.4%. The second clade, which we refer to as K. pseudorhizophila, exhibited ANI values of <95% relative to TA68 and constitutes a separate species. Delineation of the two clades would be consistent with the rest of the genus, where all other species satisfy the 95% ANI threshold criteria. Differences in the K. rhizophila and K. pseudorhizophila pangenomes likely reflect phenotypic as well as evolutionary divergence. This distinction is relevant to clinical and industrial settings, as strains and genomes from both clades are currently used interchangeably, which may lead to reproducibility issues and phenotype-genotype discordance. Investigating an innocuous laboratory contaminant has therefore provided useful insights into the understudied species K. rhizophila, prompting an unexpected reassessment of its taxonomy.

Impact statementBacterial genome sequence databases are dominated by a relatively small number of medically relevant genera, while most of the global bacterial populations diversity is largely uncharacterised. Kocuria is a widespread bacterial genus with industrial and medical relevance. Despite its ubiquity, only 22 complete and 235 draft Kocuria genomes were publicly available at the outset of this study. Our phylogenetic and pangenomic examination of all available Kocuria genomes was the first for this genus, providing insights into its diversity and taxonomy. Most notably, we found that Kocuria rhizophila is comprised of two clades that are sufficiently divergent to constitute different species, but are frequently used interchangeably in experimental and genomic research. The complete, high-quality Noodlococcus genome generated and characterised here can serve as a reference for true K. rhizophila, particularly while there is only a draft genome sequence available for type strain TA68.

Data summarySequencing reads and the assembled Noodlococcus genome are available from NBCI BioProject accession PRJNA835814 and BioSample accession SAMN28111796. The complete sequence of the Noodlococcus chromosome can be found in the GenBank nucleotide database under accession number CP097204.1.

Here, we evaluate a modified Orbitrap Astral Zoom mass spectrometer (MS) prototype and compare its performance to the standard Orbitrap Astral MS. Across a range of acquisition methods and sample inputs, the prototype instrument outperformed the standard Orbitrap Astral MS in precursor and protein identifications, ion accumulation efficiency, and reproducibility of measurements. To enable meaningful cross-platform comparisons, we implemented an ion calibration framework that converts signal intensity from arbitrary units to absolute ion counts (ions/sec). This benchmarking strategy showed that the prototype sampled 30% more ions per peptide than the original Orbitrap Astral MS. This increase in the ion beam utilization resulted in improved sensitivity and quantitative precision. To make these metrics broadly accessible, we added new metrics to the Skyline document grid to report ion counts directly from data-independent acquisition (DIA) data.

Male mice become sexually satiated after successful matings, and their motivation to mate gradually recovers over a week. Using deep-brain fluorescence-lifetime imaging in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), we found that tonic dopamine transmission - which regulates mating drive - also declined after mating and re-emerged over a week. Two mechanisms regulated dopamine transmission. First, successful mating transiently reduced tonic firing of hypothalamic dopamine-releasing neurons, thereby inhibiting dopamine release and mating behavior. Second, mating reduced the ability of these neurons to produce and release dopamine, and this ability gradually returned over the week-long recovery time course. Therefore, fast and slow mechanisms of neuronal plasticity cooperate to control the early and late phases of motivational dynamics, respectively.","NA","biorxiv",1749074906707

The identification of both intergenic and coding repertoire-associated variants indicates genetic modulation of gene usage via diverse mechanisms.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals.

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden. These findings suggest that expanded use of DDG-certified departments, including consultation services for patients whose diabetes is a secondary diagnosis, may further improve clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1749074906707

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1749074906707

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1749074906707

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
