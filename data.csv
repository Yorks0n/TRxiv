Estimates of long COVID risk after a first COVID-19 infection vary, and data on risk following reinfections remain lacking.

ObjectiveTo estimate and compare long COVID risk and severity with first COVID-19 infection versus reinfections among healthcare workers (HCWs).

DesignRetrospective cohort study based on an electronic survey among Quebec HCWs conducted between May 16 and June 15, 2023. A short telephone survey among randomly selected non-respondents further assessed potential response bias.

SettingPopulation-based study in Quebec, Canada.

Participants397 222 HCWs were invited to participate in the electronic survey and 10 500 in the telephone survey.

Main outcomes and measuresWe defined long COVID cases as HCWs self-reporting COVID-19-attributed symptoms lasting [&ge;]12 weeks, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on perceived symptom intensity. We compared self-reported symptoms and functional limitations of cases to COVID controls (infected participants without long COVID) and non-COVID controls (uninfected participants). Risk and prevalence were estimated by number of infections, likely infecting variant and perceived acute COVID-19 severity. We conducted symptom clustering analyses using unsupervised learning techniques.

ResultsEstimated long COVID risk following any COVID-19 infection was similar among 22 496 online survey participants (17.0% [95%CI, 16.3%-17.6%] and 3 978 telephone survey participants (15.9% [14.6%-17.2%]. The cumulative risk increased with the number of infections, but reinfections were associated with three times lower risk of long COVID than first infections.

Pre-Omicron infections and severe acute COVID-19 episodes correlated with higher long COVID risk and severity. Among prevalent long COVID cases, 43% were moderate and 33% severe. Compared to controls, dyspnea, neurocognitive symptoms, post-exertional malaise and smell/taste disturbances were most strongly associated with long COVID. Cluster analysis identified seven symptom groups with systemic, neurocognitive, pulmonary, and mood-related clusters being the most prevalent. Severe long COVID cases exhibited multiple symptom clusters and greater functional limitations.

ConclusionsLong COVID is a common and disabling condition among HCWs. Societal and healthcare burden remains important and will continue to accrue given ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and long COVID risk with reinfections.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes the risk and severity of long COVID differ for first COVID-19 infections versus reinfections among healthcare workers in Quebec, Canada?

FindingsThe risk of long COVID was [~]15% with first COVID-19 infection, but three-fold lower with reinfections. Risk was higher with COVID-19 infections due to ancestral strains and with more severe acute episodes. Long COVID risk and severity compromised self-rated health, physical capacity and cognitive function.

MeaningLong COVID is a common and disabling condition among workers. Societal and healthcare burden remains important and will continue to accrue given ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and long COVID risk with reinfections.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

Yet, these neural signatures are dissociable at the single-cell level: Specific cells within these visuo-oculomotor areas are exclusively involved in either motor preparation or covert attention. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that many cells in visuo-oculomotor areas are involved in both motor preparation and covert attention, and consequently their neural signatures should functionally overlap to a large degree. Here, we put this proposal to the test: we combined EEG with sensitive decoding techniques to investigate whether the neural signatures of preparatory overt and covert attention are dissociable across large-scale neuronal populations. We found that neural decoding reliably discerned whether overt or covert attention was shifted well before saccade initiation. Further, inverted encoding modeling revealed sharper spatially tuned activity in preparatory overt than in covert attention. We then asked whether preparatory overt attention achieved sharper spatially-tuned activity by using ""more-of-the-same"" covert attention, or by recruiting additional spatially selective neural processing. Cross-decoding results demonstrated that preparatory overt attention recruited at least one additional, frontal process. This additional spatially selective process emerged early and likely reflects motor preparation or predictive remapping. To summarize, we found that the neural signatures of overt and covert attention overlap, yet diverge rapidly, in part because overt attention employs an additional spatially selective neural process. Extending beyond a dissociation on the single-cell level, our findings demonstrate that population-level neural activity dissociates preparatory overt from covert attention.","NA","biorxiv",1747260452535

We found significant alterations in DNA methylation patterns in genes related to neurodevelopmental pathways that overlap with cellular processes hijacked by viruses for their own replication. The alterations were further confirmed in cord blood mononuclear cells. Subsequently, we determined the functional consequences of epigenetic rewiring due to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection without fetal infection and found that fetal exposure to mediators driven by maternal infection, results in an altered responsiveness of the infants immune cells upon subsequent cell activation in vitro.

The analysis incorporated imputation for missing data on race and parametric bootstrapping to account for sampling and imputation uncertainty. We found that legal intervention injury rates remained relatively stable over time, with Black individuals consistently experiencing rates over five times higher than White individuals, and Latinx individuals showing moderately higher rates than Whites with some evidence of decline. These findings suggest that, despite heightened public scrutiny and advocacy following nationwide protests against racialized policing, rates of nonfatal injuries from law enforcement have remained high and unequally distributed by race.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

In coral reefs, dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by benthic primary producers such as algae fuels heterotrophic microbial growth, which can be detrimental to corals. While this microbialization process has been associated with the abundance and replication strategies of bacteriophages, the direct relationship between reef DOM composition and bacteriophage communities remains unclear. Here, we combine metabolomics, metagenomes, and viromes to demonstrate that phage abundances have significant relationships with DOM composition on the reefs of Curacao, Southern Caribbean. By constructing co-occurrence networks between free or cell-associated viruses and exometabolites, we identified thousands of statistically significant associations between phages and organic compounds. While total viral abundances did not significantly correlate with overall dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, cell-associated phages had significantly more positive associations with compounds that had a reduced nominal oxidative state of carbon (NOSC). Furthermore, temperate phages were more frequently correlated with metabolites exhibiting higher Gibbs energy than lytic phages. Six of the ten viruses with the highest number of positive associations with metabolites were temperate (i.e., encoded an integrase or were identified as a prophage), despite this network consisting of approximately 90% lytic viruses. These temperate viruses were predicted to infect members of the genus Sphingobium. Together, these findings reveal a connection between phage replication strategies and DOM energy availability with potential implications for coral reef biogeochemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1747260452535

Here, we quantify the nonlinear, flow-dependent resistance of ETTs with and without a bronchoscope by analyzing pressure-flow relationships across multiple tube-bronchoscope configurations. We find that with bronchoscope insertion, tube resistance increases with the inverse fifth power of the effective tube diameter, defined as the diameter of a circular tube with the same cross-sectional area as the remaining lumen. Using an intensive care ventilator in combination with an active lung simulator, we demonstrate that the increased resistance during bronchoscopy causes dynamic hyperinflation and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) buildup in volume-controlled modes, and reduced tidal volumes in pressure-controlled modes. Numerical simulations using a simple scaling law relating resistance to effective tube diameter accurately reproduce the observed impairments. This demonstrates that the impact of tube narrowing during bronchoscopy can be reliably predicted from ventilator settings and patient respiratory mechanics. We present a predictive model that allows clinicians to anticipate and manage ventilation impairments, supporting evidence-based selection of endotracheal tubes and bronchoscopes. In addition, we provide proof of principle that combining pressure-controlled ventilation with automatic tube compensation can fully prevent these impairments, pointing to a technically feasible solution to an underrecognized clinical problem.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 is notable for its strong adhesiveness and potential as a biocatalyst for toluene degradation; however, its toluene metabolic pathway has not been fully elucidated. In this study, genomic analysis identified a cluster of genes in Tol 5 highly similar to the well-known tod operon of Pseudomonas putida, encoding enzymes responsible for toluene metabolism. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these tod genes, unusual among Acinetobacter species, were likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that todF and todC1 are co-transcribed, while the adjacent fadL2 gene, encoding a putative outer membrane transporter corresponding to P. putida todX, is independently transcribed. Functional characterization using gene-knockout mutants revealed that TodC1, the large subunit of dioxygenase, is essential for growth on toluene, whereas FadL2 is not essential. Growth experiments further showed that the todC1 knockout mutant could metabolize benzoate, but not toluene or benzene, confirming that the TOD pathway is the primary route for toluene and benzene degradation in Tol 5. The identification of the functional TOD pathway, which is unique within Acinetobacter, provides genetic and biochemical insights for the development of Tol 5 as an efficient immobilized biocatalyst for the bioremediation and bioconversion of aromatic compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1747260452535

We develop MDmis, a method that uses biophysical features extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of IDRs to predict pathogenicity. We find that pathogenic variants in Long IDRs manifest differently, with transient order and depleted solvent access, compared to those in Short IDRs. Using MD simulations of sequences with single missense variants, we identify stronger evidence for pathogenic effects in Long IDRs compared to Short IDRs. MDmis, when combined with conservation information, achieves strong predictive accuracy of pathogenicity of variants in Long IDRs.

They responded to three behavioural economic tasks: a simulated COVID-19 Vaccine Purchase Task (CVPT), HIV Vaccine Purchase Task (HVPT), and the Monetary Probability Discounting Task (MPDT). Demand curves were fitted using an exponentiated model with both purchase tasks demonstrating excellent fit (R2 = .98). Multiple regression analyses examined relationships between behavioral economic indices and demographic factors. Nigerian participants showed significantly higher price sensitivity for both COVID-19 ({beta} = 1.10, p < .001) and HIV vaccines ({beta} = 0.90, p = .001) compared to U.S. participants, while baseline demand intensity and risk tolerance were similar between countries. Monetary risk-taking behavior predicted HIV vaccine demand ({beta} = -1.10, p = .02), and higher socioeconomic status was associated with lower price sensitivity ({beta} = -1.09, p = .04). The study demonstrates the utility of behavioral economic frameworks in modeling vaccine demand across cultures, revealing cross-cultural differences in price sensitivity and the potential relationship between COVID-19 and future HIV vaccine acceptance.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

The disease mechanism of ME/CFS is unknown, with no effective curative treatments. In this study, we present a multi-site ME/CFS whole-genome analysis, which is powered by a novel deep learning framework, HEAL2. We show that HEAL2 not only has predictive value for ME/CFS based on personal rare variants, but also links genetic risk to various ME/CFS-associated symptoms. Model interpretation of HEAL2 identifies 115 ME/CFS-risk genes that exhibit significant intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. Transcriptome and network analyses highlight the functional importance of these genes across a wide range of tissues and cell types, including the central nervous system (CNS) and immune cells. Patient-derived multi-omics data implicate reduced expression of ME/CFS risk genes within ME/CFS patients, including in the plasma proteome, and the transcriptomes of B and T cells, especially cytotoxic CD4 T cells, supporting their disease relevance. Pan-phenotype analysis of ME/CFS genes further reveals the genetic correlation between ME/CFS and other complex diseases and traits, including depression and long COVID-19. Overall, HEAL2 provides a candidate genetic-based diagnostic tool for ME/CFS, and our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of ME/CFS, yielding novel insights into therapeutic targets. Our deep learning model also offers a potent, broadly applicable framework for parallel rare variant analysis and genetic prediction for other complex diseases and traits.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

We propose Joint Pleiotropic and Epigenomic Partitioning (J-PEP), a clustering framework that integrates pleiotropic SNP effects on auxiliary traits and tissue-specific epigenomic data to partition disease-associated loci into biologically distinct clusters. To benchmark J-PEP against existing methods, we introduce a metric--Pleiotropic and Epigenomic Prediction Accuracy (PEPA)--that evaluates how well the clusters predict SNP-to-trait and SNP-to-tissue associations using off-chromosome data, avoiding overfitting. Applying J-PEP to GWAS summary statistics for 165 diseases/traits (average N=290K), we attained 16-30% higher PEPA than pleiotropic or epigenomic partitioning approaches with larger improvements for well-powered traits, consistent with simulations; these gains arise from J-PEPs tendency to upweight correlated structure--signals present in both auxiliary trait and tissue data--thereby emphasizing shared components. For type 2 diabetes (T2D), J-PEP identified clusters refining canonical pathological processes while revealing underexplored immune and developmental signals. For hypertension (HTN), J-PEP identified stromal and adrenal-endocrine processes that were not identified in prior analyses. For neutrophil count, J-PEP identified hematopoietic, hepatic-inflammatory, and neuroimmune processes, expanding biological interpretation beyond classical immune regulation. Notably, integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility data refined bulk-based clusters, enhancing cell-type resolution and specificity. For T2D, single-cell data refined a bulk endocrine cluster to pancreatic islet {beta}-cells, consistent with established {beta}-cell dysfunction in insulin deficiency; for HTN, single-cell data refined a bulk endocrine cluster to adrenal cortex cells, consistent with a GO enrichment for neutrophil-mediated inflammation that implicates feedback between aldosterone production in the adrenal gland and local immune signaling. In conclusion, J-PEP provides a principled framework for partitioning GWAS loci into interpretable, tissue-informed clusters that provide biological insights on complex disease.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

Here, we aimed to establish whether  monogenic liver diseases are associated with a spectrum of liver phenotypes in adulthood.

MethodsWe identified 99 genes where pathological mutations cause significant liver disease in children. For each, we used population-level data from over 1.5 million adults to identify associations with biomarkers of liver injury (e.g. ALT). These observations were validated using six external cohorts of adults with clinical liver disease and transcriptomics. Finally, we illustrated the importance of the JAG1-NOTCH pathway on the ductular reaction in adult liver disease using immunohistochemistry and transcriptomics.

ResultsWe identified 89 genome-wide (p<5x10-8) associations with biomarkers of liver injury in 46% (45/99) of genes. Variants in ABCC2, ADK, ASL, BCS1L, HFE, and SERPINA1 were also linked with presence of clinical liver disease in adults. For example, rs2862926C>T encoding p.Ile1324= in ABCC2 (which causes Dubin-Johnson syndrome) was associated with lower ALT (p=7.1x10-12) and lower risk of MASLD (p-FDR=0.03). Transcriptional expression of 30% of genes was associated with severity of MASLD. p.Pro871Arg in JAG1 causes a subtle form of Alagille syndrome with higher bilirubin (9.7x10-10) and hypertension (p=4.2x10-14). JAG1 and NOTCH2 were expressed in injured bile ducts but not adjacent unaffected ducts and transcriptional expression of JAG1 correlated with fibrosis stage in primary sclerosing cholangitis.

ConclusionsPathways affected by severe childhood liver disease also influence risk and severity of liver disease in adulthood.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

Standard wastewater surveillance workflows typically involve wastewater concentration, nucleic acid extraction, and pathogen quantification. While various concentration methods are used, most comparisons of concentration methods have focused primarily on SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the need for further research to guide method selection for monitoring a suite of diverse pathogens. In this study, a head-to-head comparison of six different concentration methods was performed, including direct extraction (with and without bead beating), electronegative (HA) filtration, solids concentration, and magnetic bead-based concentration (using Nanotrap particles; with and without bead beating). Methods were assessed for sensitivity, inhibitor removal, and recovery rates of fourteen microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, and fungal pathogens. The cost of each method was also estimated. Results showed that the concentration method selection significantly impacts the sensitivity and economic costs of the wastewater monitoring workflow. Based on the results, a concentration approach that combines HA filtration and solids concentration is recommended to optimize detection across various pathogens. This study provides data-driven insights to enhance the reliability and cost-effectiveness of wastewater surveillance systems that can support public health responses for a broad range of diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

However, tumors with low intraepithelial T-cell infiltration, often referred to as ""cold"" tumors, are expected to yield poor responsiveness to ICB. We investigated the potential of low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) to enhance ICB responses in 25 patients with multimetastatic immune-excluded solid tumors through a multi-cohort phase I clinical trial (RACIN). Primary endpoint was to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of a backbone treatment, comprising nivolumab, ipilimumab, aspirin/celecoxib, and low-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) in association with escalated LDRT. Secondary endpoints included among others disease control rate (DCR) and overall survival (OS). Exploratory endpoints included biomarkers and molecular correlates of response. The combination treatment showed a manageable safety profile, with Grade 3 or higher adverse events in 12% to 21% of patients across cohorts. The overall DCR was 42%. Progression free survival (PFS) across all cohorts was 2.1 months (95% C.I.: 1.8 - 4.2 months), with the highest PFS observed in cohort 1 which received 0.5 Gy (5.7 months, (95% C.I.: 1.9 - 11.3 months). Median OS was 14.0 months (95% CI: 8.5-24.6 months), with one patient with ovarian cancer still maintaining a complete response at three years follow-up. Site-paired tumor biopsies collected for each patient at baseline and after LDRT +/- Cy enabled the comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of excluded tumor microenvironments (TME) at the single cell level. Response to LDRT and ICB was associated with DNA damage and repair responsiveness and the presence of detectable intratumoral PD1+CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at baseline. Our data revealed that LDRT amplified CD8+ TIL functionality in responding patients offering mechanistic insights on how LDRT improves ICB effectiveness. In contrast, we observed a radiosensitivity of TILs in tumors of non-responders. Detailed single cell immune profiling before LDRT also highlighted a lack of key immune stimulatory myeloid cells that can therefore limit ICB efficacy in excluded tumors. Collectively, this study represents the most comprehensive profiling of longitudinal samples of cancer patients treated with LDRT. Our findings highlight several genetic, transcriptomic and TME parameters associated with response to combinatorial LDRT and ICB in advanced immune-excluded solid cancers, generating rationale for their validation in larger cohorts.

Few data are available on the combined effect of concurrent underlying conditions on risk of severe outcomes from RSV disease among inpatients.

ObjectiveTo identify underlying condition profiles associated with increased risk of severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with RSV.

DesignWe applied Bayesian profile regression, an outcome-informed statistical clustering model, to identify profiles of conditions associated with increased risk of RSV-associated severe outcomes separately among adults aged 18-59 and [&ge;]60 years. Seventeen underlying conditions were selected after excluding those with rare prevalence ([&le;]1%) or high pairwise tetrachoric correlation ([&ge;]0.7).

Setting26 hospitals in 20 U.S. states

ParticipantsProspectively enrolled adults hospitalized with RSV disease admitted January 2022-July 2024

Main Outcomes and MeasuresRisks of ICU admission, acute organ failure, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death

ResultsWe analyzed data from 1111 adults hospitalized with RSV (median age [IQR] = 66 [53-75]). Among 397 adults aged 18-59 years, two profiles were identified characterized by (1) fewer underlying conditions (""minimal prevalence"" profile; 308 cases [78%]; median number of conditions = 1; IQR 1-2) with a posterior median ICU admission risk of 20.5% (95% credible interval = [16.1{square}25.0]), and (2) a cardiorenal/diabetes profile (89 cases [22%]) with frequent heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and increased ICU admission risk (37.1% [27.3{square}47.6]). Among 714 adults aged [&ge;]60 years, four profiles were identified: (1) minimal condition prevalence (460 cases [64%]; ICU admission risk = 21.6% [18.4{square}25.5]), (2) cardiorenal/diabetes (183 cases [26%]; 27.3% [21.4{square}33.6]), (3) hematologic malignancy and transplant receipt (52 cases [7%]; 11.8% [5.7{square}21.0]), and (4) chronic pulmonary disease with home oxygen dependence (19 cases [3%]; 44.0% [24.5{square}65.8]). Similar differences in risk were observed for acute organ failure and IMV or death.

Conclusion and RelevanceDistinct underlying condition profiles with varying risks of severe outcomes were identified in adults hospitalized with RSV. These findings could support recognition of high-risk patients to inform RSV prevention strategies and suggest that the role of multimorbidity in increasing severe RSV disease risk warrants further attention.

Key pointsQuestion: How does multimorbidity influence risk of severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with RSV?

Findings: In this cohort study of 1,111 U.S. adults hospitalized with RSV during 2022-2024, approximately one in four patients aged 18-59 and [&ge;]60 years had a profile of frequent heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and elevated risk of ICU admission and acute organ failure.

A 90% year on year increase from 2022 to 2023 in prevalence of blaNDM in clinical isolates was identified in a clinical microbiology laboratory serving Merseyside, UK hospitals and GP practices in 2023. We analysed isolates identified to disclose the species and plasmid diversity and to understand the mechanism of dissemination of blaNDM across Merseyside hospitals.

MethodsData regarding the sample type, the isolation date and location of samples was collected and analysed to establish initial transmission hypotheses; 64 Gram-negative bacterial isolates which tested positive for blaNDM using routine diagnostics underwent short read whole-genome sequencing. The samples were derived from seven Merseyside hospitals and a Merseyside GP practice, of these, 24 were also long-read sequenced to produce local reference assemblies and enable us to confidently resolve resistance gene locations and plasmids.

ResultsOverall, six species were identified, including Enterobacter hormaechei (n=22) Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=21), Escherichia coli (n=15) Citrobacter freundii (n=3), Citrobacter brakii (n=1) and Enterobacter kobei (n=1). Most multi-isolate species belonged to a number of sequence types (IQR, 1-10), apart from K. pneumoniae where 18/21 were ST101. Four variants of blaNDM were identified: blaNDM-1 (n=43), blaNDM-5 (n=12), blaNDM-6 (n=1), blaNDM-14 (n=1), and in six isolates blaNDM was not identified by sequencing. Long-read sequencing of 24 representative isolates found that blaNDM-1 was commonly encoded by a IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid (82.4%, n=14) whereas blaNDM-5, (n=4) was encoded on different plasmids in each isolate but had the same conserved gene cassette including blaNDM-5 in all instances. Potential evidence of transposition events was noted in two isolates, where blaNDM-1 was found on a small (8.5kbp) untypable plasmid.

ConclusionsThis study captures an outbreak of blaNDM positive Enterobacterales in Merseyside hospitals and highlights the complex epidemiology of spread mediated both by expansion of successful lineages (K. pneumoniae ST101) and plasmids. A dominant IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid that has disseminated blaNDM-1 across different species and subsequently led to small clonal outbreaks within-hospitals. This highlights the cross-species movement of AMR elements as an important factor in AMR dissemination, and the importance of both species-specific surveillance to monitor local outbreaks, but also species-agnostic surveillance to include plasmids spreading across species.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

Deep proteomic profiling of plasma is hindered by the dominance of high-abundant proteins that mask the detection of low-abundant proteins. To overcome this, we compared five plasma protein enrichment methods, MagNet, ENRICHplus, ENRICHiST, EasySep, and EXONET, against neat plasma using LC-MS proteomics. All five methods substantially increased protein identifications, with MagNet, ENRICHplus, EasySep, and EXONET yielding up to 4200 proteins per sample, over 7-fold more than neat plasma, using a 44-minute gradient on the Evosep One and data-independent acquisition on the timsTOF Pro 2. These methods enriched extracellular vesicle-associated proteins while effectively depleting high-abundant proteins. We further optimized the cost-effective MagNet protocol by increasing the plasma-to-bead ratio and automated the workflow, including Evotip loading, on the Biomek i5 liquid handler. Automated MagNet demonstrated high reproducibility and a remarkably low total cost of just a few dollars per sample. This streamlined enrichment strategy enables scalable, high-throughput LC-MS plasma proteomics, supporting biomarker discovery across large clinical cohorts.","NA","biorxiv",1747260452535

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

Nasal anti-CD3 treats animal models of progressive MS by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and lessen clinical disease.

MethodsTen patients with non-active secondary progressive MS (naSPMS) that continued to progress on B cell therapy were treated with nasal anti-CD3 (foralumab) for a minimum of six months in an open label study. Safety monitoring included otolaryngology evaluation and neurologic assessments including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC-4), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and Low Contract Visual Acuity (LCVA). MRI and microglial translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging with [F-18]PBR06 were conducted. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic biomarkers and single cell RNA sequencing of blood was performed to evaluate foralumab-induced immunomodulation. The endpoints of our study were safety, clinical effects, microglial signal and immune measures.

ResultsAll patients stabilized on EDSS scores and three of four patients treated continuously for 12 months had improvement on EDSS. Six of 10 patients had improvement in fatigue on the MFIS scale. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe AEs and no new T2 lesions were observed on MRI. There was a reduction in TSPO-PET signal over six months (p<0.05). Changes in peripheral blood gene expression occurred as early as three months and affected antigen presentation, interferon responses and regulatory pathways in multiple cell types including FoxP3+ Tregs, CD4+ Tcm cells, CD8+ Tem cells, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and B cells. TGF{beta} expression was increased across cell multiple subsets.

InterpretationThese findings identify a novel, non-toxic immune based therapy for the treatment for PIRA that acts by the induction of a regulatory immune responses and dampens microglial inflammation. Double blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted to explore nasal foralumab for the treatment of naSPMS.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535

Sex and gender mandates were introduced in grant competitions to increase womens health research. This study aimed to understand what type of womens health research is being funded and prioritized in open grant competitions in Canada.

MethodsPublicly available funded Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) project grant abstracts from 2020 and 2023 were coded for the mention of sex, gender, two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer plus (2S/LGBTQ+), and female-specific research and assessed for changes in research representation and funding. A deeper analysis of funded female-specific grant abstracts from 2023 and 2009-2020 was conducted to assess if grant abstracts focused on the 11 areas of global disease burden and death that disproportionately affect females, and if this has evolved over time.

ResultsThe percentage of abstracts mentioning sex, gender and 2S/LGBTQ+ doubled or quadrupled from 2020 to 2023, but remained at under 10% of overall funded abstracts. In contrast, female-specific research representation did not change over time, and remained at [~]7% of all research. Importantly, female-specific research largely focused on cancers (breast, gynecologic) or pregnancy. We also examined research funding representation for the top 11 global burden of disease or death for females across the 13 years and observed that cancer accounted for 2.07% of funding, whereas the other top 10 collectively accounted for 2.21% across 13 years.

ConclusionsDespite mandates for integrated sex and gender based analyses in Canada, research acknowledging which population is explored remains under 10%. Mandates are not affecting the percentage of funding for womens health grants. More efforts and support beyond sex and gender mandates are needed to increase funding for and to diversify female-specific research beyond pregnancy and cancer. Research devoted to womens health factors is key to achieving personalized medicine and improved health outcomes for everyone.","NA","medrxiv",1747260452535
