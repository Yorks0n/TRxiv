To date, the only species with complete connectomes are worms1-3 and sea squirts4 (103-104 synapses). By contrast, the fruit fly is more complex (108 synaptic connections), with a brain that supports learning and spatial memory5,6 and an intricate ventral nerve cord analogous to the vertebrate spinal cord7-11. Here we report the first adult fly connectome that unites the brain and ventral nerve cord, and we leverage this resource to investigate principles of neural control. We show that effector cells (motor neurons, endocrine cells and efferent neurons targeting the viscera) are primarily influenced by local sensory cells in the same body part, forming local feedback loops. These local loops are linked by long-range circuits involving ascending and descending neurons organized into behavior-centric modules. Single ascending and descending neurons are often positioned to influence the voluntary movement of multiple body parts, together with endocrine cells or visceral organs that support those movements. Brain regions involved in learning and navigation supervise these circuits. These results reveal an architecture that is distributed, parallelized and embodied (tightly connected to effectors), reminiscent of distributed control architectures in engineered systems12,13.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01NS121874;RF1MH117808;U24NS126935;RF1MH117815;U19NS118246;K99NS129759;R00NS117657;R01NS102333;RF1NS128785;UM1NS132253;U24NS139927;RF1MH128840;R01NS121911;U01NS131438;T32GM144273;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""222782/Z/21/Z;""},{""name"":""Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05j95n956"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Smith Family Odyssey Award;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PJ100000343;GT15790;HHMI Investigator;""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Robertson Neuroscience Investigator Award;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZA1296/1-1;EXC2151-390873048;PA787/7-3;PA787/9-3;""},{""name"":""NV INBRE"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM103440;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2127379;2014862;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KAKENHI 25K00370;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ASPIRE JPMJAP2302;CRONOS JPMJCS24K2;""},{""name"":""Max Planck Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01hhn8329"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Shanahan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Alice and Joseph Brooks Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990762

Meaning that signals flow from early sensory areas to later regions and back. Yet, between connected areas there exist some but not all pathways. How does this structure, somewhere between feedforward and fully recurrent, shape circuit function? To address this question, we designed a new recurrent neural network model in which a set of weight matrices (i.e. pathways) can be combined to generate every network structure between feedforward and fully recurrent. We term these architectures partially recurrent neural networks (pRNNs). We trained over 25,000 pRNNs on a novel set of reinforcement learning tasks, designed to mimic multisensory navigation, and compared their performance across multiple functional metrics. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, many architectures match or exceed the performance of fully recurrent networks, despite using as few as one-quarter the number of parameters; demonstrating that partial recurrence enables energy efficient, yet performant solutions. Second, each pathways functional impact is both task and circuit dependent. For instance, feedback connections enhance robustness to noise in some, but not all contexts. Third, different pRNN architectures learn solutions with distinct input sensitivities and memory dynamics, and these computational traits help to explain their functional capabilities. Overall, our results demonstrate that partial recurrence enables robust and efficient computation - a finding that helps to explain why neural circuits are sparse and bidirectional, and how these principles could inform the design of artificial systems.

One of these cues, carbon dioxide (CO2), gates odorant and heat pathways and activates host-seeking behavior. The neuronal circuits underlying processing of CO2 information remain unclear. We used automated serial-section transmission electron microscopy (EM) to image and reconstruct the circuitry of the glomeruli that are innervated by the Ae. aegypti maxillary palp, including the glomerulus that responds to CO2. Notably, CO2-sensitive olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) make high levels of recurrent synaptic connections with one another, while making a low density of feedforward synapses. At some of these contacts between CO2 OSNs, we observe ribbon- like presynaptic structures, which may further enhance recurrent signaling. We compared both feedforward and recurrent connectivity with all olfactory glomeruli in Drosophila melanogaster, and we found more recurrent connections between the Ae. aegypti CO2-responsive OSNs than in any D. melanogaster glomeruli. We developed a computational circuit model that demonstrates recurrent synapses are necessary for robust CO2 detection under normal physiological conditions. Together, elevated levels of recurrent connectivity and ribbon-like structures may amplify sensory information detected by CO2-sensitive OSNs to support mosquito activation and sensitization by CO2, even in the presence of high levels of other odorants in the environment. We propose that this circuit organization supports the salience of CO2 as a mosquito host cue.

We introduce a previously undescribed communication display in two cuttlefish species: Sepia officinalis and Sepia bandensis. The four ""arm wave signs"" are stereotyped arm movements consisting of long-lasting, expressive, and repeated sequences of undulations of the arms, which can be combined and expressed following specific patterns. Using non-invasive behavioral experiments, we tested the hypothesis that they represent multimodal communication displays. To assess the role of visual cues, we recorded videos of animals signing and played them back to individual cuttlefish participants. When seeing the movies, cuttlefish waved back at the display. Most importantly, they were more likely to wave back when the movie was in upright (original) configuration as opposed to flipped upside-down, similar to the manner in which humans perceive faces and other socially relevant displays. In addition to their visually striking display, arm wave signs produce mechanical waves in the water, prompting us to explore the possibility that they may also be perceived via mechanoreception. Using playback experiments similar to those adopted in vision, we obtained preliminary evidence to support this hypothesis, indicating that arm wave signs may represent multimodal signals involving vision and mechanoreception. Our new result on communication with arm wave signs opens up novel possibilities for understanding vibration-mediated communication through the lateral line and/or the statocysts in a cephalopod species as an example of convergent evolution with vertebrates.","[{""name"":""PSL Research University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013cjyk83"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""L'Oréal (France)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

Multipass transmembrane proteins have increased propensity to be targeted by the RQC, raising the question of whether problems in transmembrane domain insertion and assembly can also cause RQC-eliciting translational arrests. Here, we investigate RQC-mediated quality control of CFTR, a large transmembrane protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. Reporter assays show that although a sizeable fraction of nascent CFTR expressed in HEK293 cells arrests during translation and activates the RQC, multiple interventions compromising CFTR folding and membrane insertion do not exacerbate this response. CFTR translation abortion was also largely unaffected by regulators of translation kinetics such as codon usage, the ribosome collision sensor GCN1, and the SRP ER targeting complex. We propose that the RQC can be triggered by the inherent difficulties in synthesizing transmembrane segments, resulting from their inappropriate interaction with the protein synthesis machinery. Our study uncovers a novel physiological role for the RQC and points to new therapeutic targets for cystic fibrosis.","[{""name"":""Fritz Thyssen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00f3sc705"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""10.22.2.029MN;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""540625656;CRC1678 project number 520471345;""},{""name"":""Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JRG-05 and CAP-33;""},{""name"":""Köln Fortune Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cologne"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""376/2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

Through the Allen Institute's OpenScope Brain Observatory, data in mice performing a visual oddball task during multi-area laminar recording was used to test predictive processing hypotheses in the spectral domain. Histological labeling of the cortical laminae enabled a fine-grained examination of their roles in the task, and frequency bands capturing both feedforward and feedback effects were analyzed. Gamma-band local-field potential (LFP) oscillations conveyed feedforward prediction errors in lower sensory areas of cortex; alpha/beta-band oscillations weakened in unpredictable conditions compared to predictable ones; and theta-band oscillations additionally signalled slower, longer-scale temporal prediction errors.

Here, we conclude that it does not require much at all. It does not require knowing secondary structures; it does not require aligning the sequences; and it does not require many parameters. We selected a probabilistic model of palindromes (a stochastic context-free grammar or SCFG) with a total of just 21 parameters. Using standard deep learning techniques, we estimate its parameters by implementing the generative process in an automatic differentiation (autodiff) framework and applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We define and minimize a loss function that does not use any structural or alignment information. Trained on as few as fifty RNA sequences, the rules of RNA base pairing emerge after only a few iterations of SGD. Crucially, the sole inputs are RNA sequences. When optimizing for sequences corresponding to structured RNAs, SGD also yields the rules of RNA base-pair aggregation into helices. Trained on shuffled sequences, the system optimizes by avoiding base pairing altogether. Trained on messenger RNAs, it reveals interactions that are different from those of structural RNAs, and specific to each mRNA. Our results show that the emergence of canonical base-pairing can be attributed to sequence-level signals that are robust and detectable even without labeled structures or alignments, and with very few parameters. Autodiff algorithms for probabilistic models, such as, but not restricted to SCFGs, have significant potential as they allow these models to be incorporated into end- to-end RNA deep learning methods for discerning transcripts of different functionalities.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01-GM144423;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UWSC13223;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

High genomic instability of these cancers leads to chromosomal breaks (breakpoints), which disrupt the physical connection between genes and adjacent regulatory elements. Standard molQTL methods are unable to accommodate breakpoint information and would therefore indiscriminately test associations across breakpoints, leading to spurious signals and reduced biological relevance. To address these challenges, we developed SegmentQTL, a segmentation-aware molQTL analysis tool, designed to improve the accuracy of association testing in unstable cancer genomes by incorporating sample-specific breakpoint information. Results: SegmentQTL applies an integrated purifying filtering step that removes associations spanning breakpoints, ensuring that only variants within the same segment as the phenotype are tested. This prevents false discoveries and reduces background noise. We evaluated SegmentQTL on selected genes from stable and unstable genomic regions and compared its results with a previously published state-of-the-art tool. In stable regions, SegmentQTL produced similar results, validating its approach. In unstable regions, however, the filtering step refined detected associations by shifting peak locations and removing artefactual signals that would arise if genomic instability were not properly accounted for.

Here, we unify these concepts into a general mathematical framework and show that it can produce diverse spatial patterns across one-, two-, and three-dimensional domains. Using numerical simulations and stability theory, we characterize the emergence, geometry, and formation speed of these patterns.

First, TIME_ACT scores accurately identify tumors with activated immune microenvironments across cancer types. Analysis of spatial features of the tumor microenvironment revealed that TIME_ACT-high regions exhibit dense lymphocyte infiltration near tumor cells, indicating localized immune activation. Second, in 15 anti-PD1 transcriptomic cohorts spanning six cancer types, TIME_ACT outperforms 22 established signatures and methods, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76 and a clinically meaningful mean odds ratio of 6.11. Thirdly, TIME_ACT scores can be accurately inferred from tumor histopathology slides. Finally, slide-inferred TIME_ACT scores predict ICB response across eight unseen cohorts, achieving a mean AUC of 0.72 and a mean odds ratio of 5.02. These findings establish TIME_ACT as a robust, pan-cancer, and low-cost predictor of ICB response.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

To address this challenge, we developed ARTIC HELP (Homebrew Enzymes for Library Preparation), a practical, open-source adaptation of the widely adopted ARTIC nanopore sequencing protocol for viral genomic surveillance. We describe generic, cost-effective alternatives to all enzyme mixes used in tiling multiplex RT-PCR amplification of the virus genome, and the nanopore native barcoding workflow, including end-prep (EP), barcode ligation (BL), and adapter ligation (AL), making it broadly applicable to any laboratory. Through systematic evaluation, we identified a wild-type M-MLV reverse transcriptase and two types of proofreading DNA polymerases as effective alternatives when standard reagents are unavailable due to high cost or limited supply: B-family Pfu-based polymerases with a fused Sso7d DNA-binding domain, and blends combining A-family (Taq-based) and B-family (Pfu-based) polymerases. Validation on clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII confirmed that the HELP workflow achieves genome coverage comparable to the ARTIC LoCost protocol. For SARS-CoV-2 samples (Ct [&le;]28), the wild-type M-MLV RT combined with selected Pfu or A+B polymerases, along with optimised HELP mixes (EP, BL, AL), achieved genome coverage of 84.0-99.6%. For Norovirus GII (Ct [&le;]32), the HELP workflow using one of the Pfu polymerases achieved genome coverage of >85% for six out of eight genotypes tested. Notably, several of the other polymerases tested showed reduced performance at higher Ct values. However, they still achieved strong coverage at Ct <24, supporting their use as emergency alternatives in rapid outbreak-response sequencing when viral input is high and RNA quality is sufficient. Our approach, ARTIC HELP, provides a framework which can be implemented to address supply chain disruptions, while maintaining robust genomic sequencing capabilities. A cost analysis highlights the well-known significant global disparities in reagent pricing, driven not by protocol differences but by import fees and supply barriers. Thus, our findings highlight the need for fairer global pricing models and support for local sourcing strategies like HELP, to promote equity in genomic research and ensure preparedness for future public health challenges.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""206298/B/17/Z;313694/Z/24/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

The Amazonian tree flora is the most species-rich on Earth, and largely arose as a result of rapid evolutionary radiations. While polyploidy is an important catalyst of rapid radiations, it remains poorly studied in tropical tree radiations. We examined ploidy variation across Inga (Fabaceae), a characteristic Amazonian tree radiation, using DNA sequence data from 1305 loci for 189/282 Inga species. We then tested whether polyploid species experience more positive selection than diploids, particularly in loci underlying chemical defence against herbivory, which is a key ecological pressure affecting rainforest tree diversification. We show that tetraploidy occurs in 14% (N=27) of the Inga species we sequenced, with several widespread species showing geographical ploidy variation, alongside minimal phylogenetic signal in ploidy which suggests recurrent polyploidisation. Interestingly, we found more loci under selection in polyploids than diploids, most notably in chemical defence loci. Our results show that polyploidy has arisen independently in several Inga species, and that polyploidisation can lead to elevated selection in chemical defence, helping to shape ecological interactions and influence diversification in Inga.","[{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/V012258/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/P022898/1;BB/S019669/1;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DEB-0640630;DEB-1135733;DBI-2410238;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""218247/Z/19/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

While typically silenced by epigenetic mechanisms, mounting evidence indicates TEs can regulate gene expression and chromatin architecture. However, their regulatory roles under various environmental exposures remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the regulatory functions of TEs in mouse liver tissue following early-life exposure to environmental toxicants, including arsenic (As), lead (Pb), bisphenol A (BPA), tributyltin (TBT), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5). These toxicants are linked to various health issues, including neurodevelopmental deficits, metabolic and immune dysfunction, and increased cancer risks. Integrative analysis of 351 multi-omics datasets from liver tissues of 5-month-old mice indicated that early-life environmental exposures significantly altered chromatin accessibility and expression of TEs in later life stage, revealing distinct exposure-specific signatures and sex-dependent responses. 6,699 TEs were identified with altered chromatin accessibility, mostly in non-coding regions, suggesting potential impact on gene regulation. Within these TEs, LINE elements were enriched in genes involved in metabolic pathways, while LTR elements, particularly the ORR1E subfamily, were predominantly associated with immune-related genes. Additionally, we identified 140 TE-gene chimeric transcripts with TE-derived novel transcription start sites, highlighting TE-contributed transcriptional plasticity. Our findings depict a comprehensive landscape of TE regulation under early-life toxicant exposures, offering insights into TEs biology and their impact on health and disease.","[{""name"":""National Institute Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U24ES026699;R35GM142917;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

Although many trees have white bracts, there is consumer demand for novel pigmentation in the bracts combined with other traits of interest. Because the genetic basis of all traits in flowering dogwood is unknown, combining them using traditional breeding efforts is time, labor, and space-intensive. We developed foundational genomic resources to establish marker-assisted selection within flowering dogwood breeding. We generated diploid, chromosome-scale, annotated genome assemblies for one pink-bracted and red-leafed tree and one white-bracted and green-leafed tree. Additionally, a phenotyping protocol for bract color and presence/absence diagnostic SNPs for bract and leaf color were established. We leveraged these resources to evaluate linkage associations and differential gene expression related to anthocyanin biosynthesis to identify candidate genes regulating bract and leaf pigmentation. Within a 14Mb locus we identified 14 anthocyanin-related candidate genes. Two genes, with MYB (g19533) and RING finger (g19556) binding domains, had both differential gene expression and variants with the expected segregation pattern.

In plants, this is exemplified by the deeply conserved CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIPIII) family of TFs. HD-ZIPIII activity is controlled by inputs at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. As part of their multidomain architecture, HD-ZIPIII TFs contain a StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, a ubiquitously distributed evolutionary module that binds various types of lipophilic ligands. Here, we show that HD-ZIPIII and HD-ZIPIV proteins contain a cryptic, deeply conserved START domain which we term the disorder-containing START domain (dSTART). The dSTART domain is required for HD-ZIPIII developmental function, controlling their subcellular localization and DNA-binding properties. The dSTART domain also helps discriminate responsive from non-responsive binding sites across the HD-ZIPIII shared genetic network. Finally, we identify candidate ligands of the dSTART domain including several species of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. The identification and functional characterization of a cryptic START domain provides new mechanistic insights into a deeply conserved family of TFs with roles in nearly all aspects of plant development.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2310356;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R35GM158110;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

Existing approaches face challenges with channel quality variability, neuron-specific waveform drifts, and nonlinear changes in spike shapes that depend on neuronal morphology and electrode proximity. We introduce KIASORT (Knowledge-Integrated Automated Spike Sorting), which integrates knowledge from channel-specific classifiers trained on clustered spike waveforms to sort the data. KIASORT evaluates channel quality, automatically excludes noisy recordings, and identifies spike classes using a hybrid dimensionality reduction approach combining linear with nonlinear embeddings.

KIASORTs geometry-free, per-neuron tracking approach overcomes these limitations without assumptions about cluster shape or temporal stability. Specifically, KIASORT identified significantly greater number of high-quality units than Kilosort4 in ground-truth simulations with neuron-specific drift, while maintaining real-time processing capability.

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood2,3. To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

Horizontal transfer of transposons (HTT) is important for their long-term persistence, but has only been systematically studied in animals, and thus the abundance, impact, and factors that shape HTTs in lineages outside animals is unknown. Fungi are at least as ancient and diverse as animals and are characterized by extensive genome size variation caused by transposons. Here, we screened 1,348 genomes across fungal biodiversity, genome sizes, and lifestyles to detect extensive HTTs, that generated on average 7% but up to 70% of the transposon content in some taxa. We in total identified at least 5,518 independent HTTs, mostly involving Tc1/Mariner DNA transposons. While the majority of HTTs occur between closely related taxa, irrespective of their lifestyles, HTTs were particularly common in Mucoromycotina, Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Leotiomycetes. Importantly, species lacking fungal-specific defense mechanisms against transposons and those with gene-sparse and repeat-rich genomic compartments are involved in significantly higher number of HTTs, unveiling ecological and genomic factors shaping HTTs. Our findings thus illuminate the dynamic landscape of HTTs in fungi, providing the framework to further study the impact of HTTs on genome evolution and the processes that mediate transposon transfers within and between eukaryotic lineages.","[{""name"":""Utrecht University, Incentive Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

The current global pandemic preparedness initiatives have promoted also the preclinical evaluation of a new group of Coronavirus vaccines. In the present work a nasal vaccine candidate based on two highly conserved Sarbecovirus proteins, S2 and nucleocapsid (N), is evaluated in two different mice strains. The vaccine preparation, containing a CpG ODN as adjuvant, was able to generate high antibody titers against both antigens, in sera and bronchoalveolar lavages. This antibody response results cross-reactive to S2 from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and to N from SARS-CoV-1. However, a very low neutralizing capacity was found in the sera of the immunized mice when a pseudoviral system assay was used. On the other hand, the vaccine preparation induces, at systemic compartment, IFN {gamma} secretion, and a marked IgG2a response, specific against both proteins; a profile consistent with the development of a Th1 pattern.

This study evaluates the immunogenicity in non-human primates of two broad-spectrum nasal vaccine candidates called PanCoV. The vaccine preparations are based on highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2, specifically the nucleocapsid (N) and the S2 subunit from Spike protein, which include several relevant T-cell epitopes and have the potential to form virus-like particles. PanCoV1 candidate contains the N protein, while the PanCoV2 comprises a chimeric protein containing the C-terminal domain of N protein fused to a fragment of S2 subunit. Both vaccine candidates also include the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from Spike protein and the ODN-39M as CpG adjuvant. The results demonstrate that both nasal vaccine candidates can boost the anti-RBD immune response and induce anti-N immunity, this systemic response shows cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H-CoV antigens. In addition, a neutralizing response against SARS-CoV-2 that persisted for almost three months after the last dose was induced. A mucosal-specific and cross-reactive IgA response was also observed, mainly in monkeys vaccinated with PanCoV2. Furthermore, the specific IFN{gamma}-secreting response observed in the vaccinated groups peripheral blood mononuclear cells highlights the ability of these candidates to stimulate cellular immunity with a Th1 bias.

SARS-CoV-2 (a Sarbecovirus and member of the Betacoronavirus genus responsible for the pandemic) virus was first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019. Effective mRNA vaccines based on the viral Spike protein were designed from the earliest isolates and available by December of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve in the human population, accruing neutralizing antibody resistance mutations that have necessitated updating the vaccine periodically to better match contemporary variants. Neutralizing antibody cross-reactivity is generally very limited among the diverse members of the betacoronavirus genus that are of clinical importance in people. Here, we present an alternative vaccine strategy based on eliciting T-cell responses targeting four highly conserved regions shared across the betacoronavirus proteomes. We hypothesized that cross-reactive responses to these regions could temper disease severity. Focusing immune responses on highly conserved epitopes could be beneficial as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, or if a novel betacoronavirus should enter the human population. Vaccination with these highly conserved regions induced robust T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques. Vaccinated hamsters were significantly protected against weight loss and lung inflammation after challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. After a SARS-CoV-2 Delta challenge in rhesus macaques, 3 out of 4 animals in the control group had infectious virus in their bronchoalveolar lavage samples, while the 4 animals in the vaccinated group did not.","[{""name"":""Bisciotti Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Lya and Harrison Latta Fund for the Advancement of Pathology"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""COVID-19 Preclinical Discovery Awards"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

However, achieving precise control over tissue mechanics to direct specific morphogenetic outcomes remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a strategy to program tissue shape transformations through the nematic organization of cellular forces. By precisely controlling nematic order and topological defects, we generate millimeter-scale tissues programmed with specific multicellular tension fields. Using a theoretical framework that integrates contractile nematics with thin sheet mechanics, we explore the role of nematically guided tensions in shape morphogenesis. Experimentally, upon tissue detachment, nematically guided tension fields drive out-of-plane deformations, generating reproducible 3D shapes. By integrating tissue contractility and nematic patterning, our approach offers a robust framework for the rational design of shape-programmable living surfaces.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs.

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD115268;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","[{""name"":""Levy-Longenbaugh Donor-Advised Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DBI-2321666;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0019749;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM157729;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks.

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations.

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6. Our study explains how phages commonly evade bacterial immune signaling, and offers a structure-guided analytical approach for discovery of viral immune-manipulating proteins in any database of choice.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

Identifying phage triggers is crucial to our understanding of immune signaling, however, they are challenging to predict. Here we used an expansive plasmid library that expressed 400 phage protein-coding genes from 6 different phages to identify novel triggers of known and undiscovered antiphage systems. We transformed our library into 72 diverse strains of E. coli. Each strain natively harbors a different suite of antiphage systems whose activation typically inhibits growth. By tracking plasmids that were selectively depleted, we identified over 100 candidate phage trigger-E. coli pairs. Two phage trigger proteins were investigated in detail, revealing a novel antiphage system that detects multiple phage tail fiber proteins and identifying major capsid protein as the activating ligand of the antiphage system Avs8. These experiments provide a unique dataset for continued definition of the molecular details of the bacterial immune system.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Pew Charitable Trusts"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xhk2825"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Boettcher Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0277pn602"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

The mechanisms that initiate endocytic actin assembly are incompletely understood. In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, actin assembly is initiated by Dip1, an Arp2/3 activator. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of actin assembly has remained a mystery. Here we show that S. cerevisiae Ldb17, the homolog of Dip1, functions as an on-switch for endocytic actin assembly. Unexpectedly, the regulation of Ldb17 is more complicated than that of constitutively active Dip1. Ldb17 is controlled by a coat protein, Sla1, via separate recruitment and activation steps. This regulation was likely lost in the S. pombe lineage and this simplification may be related to other changes in actin assembly between these species. Our findings add a key missing piece in the understanding of endocytosis in S. cerevisiae and reveal an intriguing evolutionary tinkering of the actin on-switch.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""212288;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

We combined chemically imposed immune activation with single-cell transcriptomics to profile ETI responses across all leaf cell types in Arabidopsis. Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions. Our findings uncover a layered immune architecture in plants, challenges the assumption of uniform immune execution, and provides a framework for exploring cell-type-specific resistance logic in multicellular hosts.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101039824;""},{""name"":""Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.193.104;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF-842-2015;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

SINEs retain sequence features recognized by the POL III machinery and constitute a substantial portion of vertebrate genomes. Despite their impact on genome stability and evolution, the mechanisms governing SINE transcription remain poorly understood. Although DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation have been implicated in their repression, we find these pathways play only a minor role in mouse embryonic stem cells. Instead, we identify the ChAHP complex as a key repressor of SINE B2 elements. ChAHP directly inhibits POL III transcription by blocking TFIIIB recruitment without affecting TFIIIC binding. This selective interference prevents transcription initiation and highlights a distinct regulatory mechanism. Our findings establish ChAHP as a non-canonical repressor of POL III-dependent SINE transcription, offering new insights into the control of this pervasive class of non-coding genomic elements.","[{""name"":""Novartis Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""n.a.;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""grant 10.001.858;""},{""name"":""EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 705-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763

However, the regulatory logic and specific gene networks that define cell identities remain poorly resolved across the animal tree of life. As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures. To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer ontogenetic relationships among cell types. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types. Our results reveal the regulatory complexity underlying cell differentiation in a morphologically simple animal and highlight conserved principles in animal gene regulation. This work provides a foundation for comparative regulatory genomics to understand the evolutionary emergence of animal cell type diversity.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-StG 851647;""},{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2021-124757NB-I00;FPI Severo Ochoa PhD fellowship;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie INTREPiD co-fund agreement 75442;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie grant agreement 101031767;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754258990763
