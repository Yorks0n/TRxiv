There exists a paucity of genetic studies that can shed light on potential mechanisms leading to Long COVID. Using consented and genotyped data from 23andMe adult research participants, we conducted the largest multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of Long COVID across European (42,899 cases, 94,721 controls), Latinx (8,631 cases, 20,351 controls), and African-American (2,234 cases, 5,596 controls) genetic ancestry groups. GWAS of Long COVID identified three genome-wide significant loci (HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB, ABO, BPTF:KPAN2:C17orf58). Functional analysis of these genes points to underlying immune and thrombo-inflammatory mechanisms. We present evidence of shared genetic architecture (genetic correlation p-value < 0.001) of Long COVID with thirteen phenotypes of similar symptomatology or pathophysiology. We identified potential causal roles from liability to chronic fatigue (Mendelian randomization OR=1.59, 95% CI[1.51,1.66]), fibromyalgia (OR=1.54, 95% CI[1.49,1.60]), and depression (OR=1.53, 95% CI[1.46,1.61]) with Long COVID, which replicated in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative data, and which are unlikely to originate from collider bias. These findings can help identify populations vulnerable to Long COVID and inform future therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1728857339806

Here, we describe intranasal booster strategy with unadjuvanted recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) following initial mRNA-LNP vaccination, Prime and HA. This regimen establishes highly protective HA-specific mucosal immune memory responses in the respiratory tract. Intranasal HA boosters provided significantly reduced viral replication compared to parenteral mRNA-LNP boosters in both young and old mice. Correlation analysis revealed that slightly increased levels of nasal IgA are significantly associated with a reduced viral burden in the upper respiratory tract. Intranasal boosting with an antigenically distinct H1 HA conferred sterilizing immunity against heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. Additionally, a heterosubtypic intranasal H5 HA booster elicited cross-reactive mucosal humoral responses. Our work illustrates the potential of a nasal HA protein booster as a needle- and adjuvant-free strategy to prevent infection and disease from influenza A viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

Despite the central importance of signaling in biomedical research, our ability to quantify it in individual cells over time remains limited. Here, we introduce INSCRIBE, an approach for reconstructing signaling history in single cells using endpoint fluorescence images. By regulating a CRISPR base editor, INSCRIBE generates mutations in genomic target sequences, at a rate proportional to signaling activity. The number of edits is then recovered through a novel ratiometric readout strategy, from images of two fluorescence channels. We engineered human cell lines for recording WNT and BMP pathway activity, and demonstrated that INSCRIBE faithfully recovers both the intensity and duration of signaling. Further, we used INSCRIBE to study the variability of cellular response to WNT and BMP stimulation, and test whether the magnitude of response is a stable, heritable trait. We found a persistent memory in the BMP pathway. Progeny of cells with higher BMP response levels are likely to respond more strongly to a second BMP stimulation, up to 3 weeks later. Together, our results establish a scalable platform for genetic recording and in situ readout of signaling history in single cells, advancing quantitative analysis of cell-cell communication during development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

Despite this, no studies have employed proteomics to characterize host immune responses to severe pediatric vLRTI in both the lower airway and systemic circulation. To address this gap, gain insights into vLRTI pathophysiology, and test a novel diagnostic approach, we assayed 1,305 proteins in tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma from 62 critically ill children using SomaScan. We performed differential expression (DE) and pathway analyses comparing vLRTI (n=40) to controls with non-infectious acute respiratory failure (n=22), developed a diagnostic classifier using LASSO regression, and analyzed matched TA and plasma samples. We further investigated the impact of viral load and bacterial coinfection on the proteome. The TA signature of vLRTI was characterized by 200 DE proteins (Padj<0.05) with upregulation of interferons and T cell responses and downregulation of inflammation-modulating proteins including FABP and MIP-5. A nine-protein TA classifier achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.90-1.00) for identifying vLRTI. In plasma, the host response to vLRTI was more muted with 56 DE proteins. Correlation between TA and plasma was limited, although ISG15 was elevated in both compartments. In bacterial coinfection, we observed increases in the TNF-stimulated protein TSG-6, as well as CRP, and interferon-related proteins. Viral load correlated positively with interferon signaling and negatively with neutrophil-activation pathways. Taken together, our study provides fresh insight into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI, and identifies novel protein biomarkers with diagnostic potential.

IMPORTANCEWe describe the first proteomic profiling of the lower airway and blood in critically ill children with severe viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI). From tracheal aspirate (TA), we defined a proteomic signature of vLRTI characterized by increased expression of interferon signaling proteins and decreased expression of proteins involved in immune modulation including FABP and MIP-5. Using machine learning, we developed a parsimonious diagnostic classifier that distinguished vLRTI from non-infectious respiratory failure with high accuracy. Comparative analysis of paired TA and plasma specimens demonstrated limited concordance, although the interferon-stimulated protein ISG15 was significantly upregulated with vLRTI in both compartments. We further identified TSG-6 and CRP as airway biomarkers of bacterial-viral coinfection, and viral load analyses demonstrated positive correlation with interferon-related protein expression and negative correlation with the expression of neutrophil activation proteins. Taken together, our study provides new insight into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

We report genome-wide data from 248 ancient individuals from the largely unsampled period 100-800 CE and co-analyze them with previously reported data. In the Roman era, we document profound demographic transformation, with an influx of people with ancestry from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean in all the areas under study and of North Africans, especially in central and southern Iberia. Germanic (Buri, Suebi, Vandals & Visigoths) and Sarmatian (Alans) took over political control beginning in the 5th century, and although we identify individuals with Germanic-associated ancestry at sites with Germanic-style ornaments and observe that such individuals were closely related across large distances as in the case of two siblings separated by 700 km, for Iberia as a whole, we observe high continuity with the previous Hispano-Roman population. The demographic patterns in Iberia contrast sharply with those in Britain, which showed the opposite pattern of little change in the Roman period followed by great change in the Migration period, and also from demographic patterns in the central Mediterranean where both periods were associated with profound transformation, raising broader questions about the forces that precipitated change over this time.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

While small animals vocalize at higher pitch than large ones due to the smaller size of their vocal apparatus, the rules governing vocalization rhythms throughout the animal kingdom remain unknown. Vocal rhythms serve as a natural information parser, and one possibility is that they are constrained by the neural rhythms of transmitter and receiver, known to be relatively conserved across species and independent of their size. In this study, we quantified acoustic rhythms across taxa and investigated their evolutionary history with regard to phylogeny and selective pressure. In 98 species from six classes, we tested the main factors likely to influence their communication rhythms: morphology, physiology, social complexity, mastication and detectability. Phylogenetic modeling did not confirm the influence of these species-specific factors, but rather point to a scenario where acoustic communication rhythms have been maintained around an optimum at around 3Hz in the biological (neuronal) delta range (1-4Hz) well before the mammals split. These results suggest that the rhythm of acoustic communication signals, unlike their pitch, has a universal neural determinant that has been conserved throughout evolution, allowing for intra- and cross-species signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

Here, we imaged tick-borne flavivirus replication in human cells using cryo-electron tomography. We find that the RO membrane bud is shaped by a combination of a curvature-establishing coat and the pressure from intraluminal template RNA. A protein complex at the RO base extends to an adjacent membrane, where immature virions bud. Naturally occurring furin site variants determine whether virions mature in the immediate vicinity of ROs. We further visualize replication in mouse brain tissue by cryo-electron tomography. Taken together, these findings reveal a close spatial coupling of flavivirus genome replication, budding, and maturation.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

Many proteins exert their functions through interactions with other proteins, and a significant challenge is designing these interactions effectively. While most efforts have focused on larger, more stable proteins, shorter peptides offer advantages such as lower manufacturing costs, reduced steric hindrance, and the ability to traverse cell membranes when cyclized. However, less structural data is available for peptides and their flexibility makes them harder to design. Here, we present a method to design both novel linear and cyclic peptide binders of varying lengths based solely on a protein target sequence. Our approach does not specify a binding site or the length of the binder, making the procedure completely blind. We demonstrate that linear and cyclic peptide binders of different lengths can be designed with nM affinity in a single shot, and adversarial designs can be avoided through orthogonal in silico evaluation, tripling the success rate.

We also conducted regional assessments of species numbers, which allowed us to refine global estimates by providing an accurate overview of the taxonomic deficit in different latitudinal locations on the planet. Our results allow us to propose a conservative estimation of global diversity of the order of 30,000 species. This means that the 5,679 species and subspecies already described represent at best around 20% of the global number of earthworm species. Considering the current rate of new species description, we calculate that it would take at least 120 years to describe all the species existing on Earth.

By the use of a bunch of techniques and libraries, such as Shiny, htrr, dplyr, tibble, rvest or visNetwork, we have developed an application that provides a well-designed user-oriented interface with all the facilities to assess their data and start analyzing it directly from the scratch through a few steps. The software, as mentioned, allows an exhaustive exploration of KEGG pathways and Gene Ontologies, facilitating the analysis of complex biological processes. To achieve this, functions described in the scripts integrate data manipulation methods and web scraping techniques in order to extract the necessary information from online official databases, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGGs) and QuickGo. Furthermore, those functions are computed by parallel processing, resulting in efficient petitions to the database servers and allowing the user to get quick results from a large dataset. A fundamental feature in the app is the capability, by the techniques explained above, to obtain ancestral information for KEGG pathways and gene ontologies, making easier to understand the hierarchy of those and how each of the samples in a dataset are classified through it; offering users a way to study the dataset in different levels of taxonomy directly from the raw data. Additionally, the ability to create interactive networks is implemented, with the aim of representing all the experimental data to be able to see the relationships between the groups and the ontologies, without disregarding the classification created, being the main tool to understand the meaning of the relations that will be seen around the system displayed. As a result of all these attributes, the software represents a key tool for the analyst involved in the study of KEGG pathways and Gene Ontologies, as providing an intuitive interface with advanced data processing techniques, allowing researchers to puzzle out the intricacy of the biological functions and obtain insights the relationships between genes or molecular components.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

Here, we present a complementary, data-driven method to retrieve the tuning properties of visual neurons. Exploiting deep generative networks and electrophysiology in monkeys, we first used a method to reconstruct any stimulus from its evoked neuronal activity in the inferotemporal cortex (IT). Then, by arbitrarily perturbing the response of individual cortical sites in the model, we generated naturalistic and interpretable sequences of images that strongly influence neural activity of that site. This method enables the discovery of previously unknown tuning properties of high-level visual neurons that are easily interpretable, which we tested with carefully controlled stimuli. When we knew which images drove the neurons, we activated the cells with electrical microstimulation and observed a predicable shift of the monkey perception in the direction of the preferred image. By allowing the brain to tell us what it cares about, we are no longer limited by our experimental imagination.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

Characterizing transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is essential for understanding TF functions and identifying TF target genes, but many predicted TFBSs lack clear biological significance. We generated an atlas of TFBSs across ten flowering plants and demonstrated that conserved TFBSs are strongly enriched for genomic and epigenomic signatures of functional regulatory elements. We uncovered conserved properties of TFBSs, including TF family-specific clustering of binding sites in distinct promoter and gene body locations. By integrating this atlas with single nuclei RNA and chromatin profiles, we elucidated conserved TF activity underlying development and stress responses and annotated key cell type-specific regulatory pathways. Finally, we found that TF ortholog binding specificity is preserved over long evolutionary times, suggesting that divergence of regulatory sequences, rather than TFs, is a primary driver of regulatory evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects.

Despite its importance in human development, gastrulation remains difficult to study. Stem cell-based embryo models, including those that recapitulate different aspects of pre- and peri-gastrulation human development5-15, are emerging as promising tools for studying human embryogenesis16-18. However, it remains unclear whether existing human embryo models are capable of modeling the development of the trilaminar embryonic disc structure, a hallmark of human gastrulation. Here we report a transgene-free human embryo model derived solely from primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which recapitulates various aspects of peri-gastrulation human development, including formation of trilaminar embryonic layers situated between dorsal amnion and ventral definitive yolk sac and primary hematopoiesis. We term this model the peri-gastrulation trilaminar embryonic disc (PTED) embryoid. The development of PTED embryoid does not follow natural developmental sequences of cell lineage diversification or spatial organization. Instead, it exploits both extrinsic control of tissue boundaries and intrinsic self-organizing properties and embryonic plasticity of the diverse peri-gastrulation-stage cell lineages, leading to the emergence of in vivo-like tissue organization and function at a global scale. Our lineage tracing study reveals that in PTED embryoids, embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm cells, as well as embryonic and extraembryonic endoderm cells, share common progenitors emerging during peri-gastrulation development. Active hematopoiesis and blood cell generation are evident in the yolk sac-like structure of PTED embryoids. Together, PTED embryoids provide a promising and ethically less challenging model for studying self-organizing properties of peri-gastrulation human development.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

Treatment aimed mainly at pain reduction, which may not target the underlying pathophysiology, is frequently ineffective. Another impediment to the effective management of SFN may be the significant between-patient heterogeneity. Accordingly, we launched this study to gain insights into the symptomatic variability of SFN and determine if SFN patients can be sub-grouped based on clinical characteristics.

MethodsTo characterize the phenotype and investigate how patients with SFN differ from those with large fiber involvement, 105 patients with skin-biopsy proven SFN and 45 with mixed fiber neuropathy (MFN) were recruited. Using unsupervised machine learning, SFN patients were clustered based upon symptom concurrence and severity. Demographics, clinical data, symptoms, and skin biopsy- and laboratory findings were compared between the groups.

ResultsMFN- as compared to SFN patients, were more likely to be male, older, had a lower intraepidermal nerve fiber density at the ankle and more frequent abnormal immunofixation. Beyond these differences, symptom prevalence and intensities were similar in the two cohorts. SFN patients comprised three distinct phenotypic clusters, which differed significantly in symptom severity, co-occurrence, localization, and skin biopsy findings. Only one subgroup, constituting about 20% of the patient population, was characterized by intense neuropathic pain, which was always associated with several other SFN symptoms of similarly high intensities. A pauci-symptomatic cluster comprised patients who experienced few SFN symptoms, generally of low to moderate intensity. The largest cluster was characterized by intense fatigue, myalgias and subjective weakness, but lower intensities of burning pain and paresthesia.

DiscussionThis data-driven study introduces a new approach to subgrouping patients with SFN. Considering both neuropathic pain and pernicious symptoms beyond pain, we identified three clusters, which may be related to distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Although additional validation will be required, our findings represent a step towards stratified treatment approaches and, ultimately, personalized treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1728857339806

While traditional approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely related (~11 MY divergence) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals, and we demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This contrasts with patterns of viral adaptation in humans, which may contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

We used de novo protein design to first generate binders to individual IR extracellular domains, and then to fuse these together in different orientations and with different conformational flexibility. We describe a series of synthetic agonists that signal through the IR that differ from insulin and from each other in the induction of receptor autophosphorylation, MAPK activation, intracellular trafficking, and cell proliferation. We identify designs that are more potent than insulin causing much longer lasting reductions in glucose levels, and that retain signaling activity on disease-causing receptor mutants that do not respond to insulin. These results inform our understanding of how changes in receptor conformation and dynamics are transmitted to downstream signaling, and our synthetic agonists have considerable therapeutic potential for diabetes and severe insulin resistance syndromes.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

Projections from the LHA to the lateral habenula (LHb) shape internal states, with excitatory estrogen receptor 1-expressing (Esr1+) LHA-LHb neurons driving aversive responses and sustained negative states. Here, we identify and functionally characterize a specific projection from the nucleus accumbens (ACB) that targets Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons. Using cell-type-specific tracing of monosynaptic inputs, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and neuroanatomical mapping, we demonstrate that the Esr1+ LHA-LHb pathway receives a major input from a striosomal Tac1+/Tshz1+/Oprm1+ ACB neuron subtype. Intersectional cell-type-specific and input-output defined optogenetic manipulation of this ACB-LHA-LHb pathway revealed its role in signaling aversion after repeated activation, with the negative behavioral state being dependent on recruitment of Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons. Importantly, we found that activation of the D1+ ACB-LHA pathway drives reward-independent compulsive-like seeking behaviors, expressed as compulsive digging or poking behaviors. We found that these complex yet stereotyped behaviors compete with highly motivated states and can override the need for natural rewards or social stimuli. Our findings reveal a discrete striosomal Tac1+ ACB projection targeting the aversive Esr1+ LHA-LHb pathway as a key circuit that promotes compulsive seeking behaviors over goal-directed actions.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339806

In this study, we used PacBio long-read sequencing, CUT&RUN sequencing, DNA methylation analysis, and RNA sequencing to generate genomic and epigenomic maps of these regions. We find that centromeric regions are primarily occupied by 120-mer Minor satellites, with other Minor Satellite length variants, 112-mers and 112-64-dimers, localized at centromere-pericentric junctions. Pericentromeric regions are mainly composed of homogeneous Major satellites, while pericentric-chromosomal junctions contain a higher density of divergent satellites. Additionally, the density of non-satellite repeats increases progressively from centromeres to pericentromeres, and further toward chromosomal arm junctions. We found that 120-mer Minor satellites in the core centromere are highly enriched with CENP-A, while the 112-mers and 112-64-dimers show lower CENP-A levels. Homogeneous Major satellites are more enriched with H3K9me3 heterochromatin, whereas divergent Major satellites are preferentially associated with H3K27me3.

Tremendous progress in sample preparation, imaging and data processing over the past decade has contributed to the identification and determination of large biomolecular complexes. However, the majority of proteins are of a size that still eludes identification in cellular cryo-EM data, and most proteins exist in low copy numbers. Therefore, novel tools are needed for cryo-EM to identify the vast majority of macromolecules across multiple size scales (from microns to nanometers). Here, we introduce and validate novel nanogold probes that enable the detection of specific proteins using cryo-ET (cryo-Electron Tomography) and resin-embedded correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM). We demonstrate that these nanogold probes can be introduced into live cells, in a manner that preserves intact molecular networks and cell viability. We use this system to identify both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins by room temperature EM, and resolve associated structures by cryo-ET. We further employ gold particles of different sizes to enable future multiplexed labeling and structural analysis. By providing high efficiency protein labeling in live cells and molecular specificity within cryo-ET tomograms, we establish a broadly enabling tool that significantly expands the proteome available to electron microscopy.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

However, the lack of three-dimensional (3D) characterization of ovary elasticity limits our understanding of localized elasticity patterns and their connection to the tissue composition. Here, we developed an integrated approach to link ovarian tissue elasticity, volume, and cell-matrix composition using quantitative micro-elastography (QME), a label-free, non-invasive approach to study the 3D microscale elasticity in conjunction with immunofluorescence microscopy. QME revealed distinct spatial elasticity patterns in ovarian compartments, namely follicles and corpora lutea (CLs), and local elasticity alterations in different age cohorts. For example, CL elasticity significantly increased during ovarian ageing while follicle elasticity changed minimally. CLs showed size-dependent elasticity changes, while follicles exhibited distinct spatial variations in elasticity correlated with the emergence of theca cell layers during follicle development. These findings have the potential to guide the development of novel diagnostic tools and identify therapeutic targets, improving women's reproductive health and longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Given the relatively small number of signaling pathways, the existence of multiple related ligands for many of these pathways is thought to represent a key evolutionary innovation for encoding complexity into cell-cell signaling. Relatedly, crosstalk and other interactions between pathways is another critical feature which allows a modest number pathways to ultimately generate an enormously diverse range of outcomes. It would thus be useful to have genetic tools to identify and manipulate not only those cells which express a given signaling ligand, but also those cells that specifically co-express pairs of signaling ligands. Here, we present a collection of split-Gal4 knock-in lines targeting many of the ligands for highly conserved signaling pathways in Drosophila (Notch, Hedgehog, FGF, EGF, TGF, JAK/STAT, JNK, and PVR). We demonstrate that these lines faithfully recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of their targets, and that they can be used to specifically identify the cells and tissues that co-express pairs of signaling ligands. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the 4th chromosome TGFligands myoglianin and maverick are broadly co-expressed in muscles and other tissues of both larva and adults, and that the JAK/STAT ligands upd2 and upd3 are partially co-expressed from cells of the midgut following gut damage. Together with our previously collection of split-Gal4 lines targeting the seven Wnt ligands, this resource allows Drosophila researchers to identify and genetically manipulate cells that specifically express pairs of conserved ligands from nearly all the major intercellular signaling pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

To investigate interactions in the mycobacterial oxidative phosphorylation machinery, we prepared inverted membrane vesicles from Mycobacterium smegmatis and enriched for vesicles containing complexes of interest by affinity chromatography. Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) of these vesicles revealed that malate-quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo), an enzyme from the Krebs cycle, physically associates with the electron transport chain Complex III2IV2 (CIII2CIV2) supercomplex. Analysis of the Mqo:CIII2CIV2 interaction shows that CIII2CIV2 is necessary for malate-driven, but not NADH- driven, electron transport chain activity and oxygen consumption. Further, the association of Mqo with CIII2CIV2 enables electron transfer from malate to CIII2CIV2 with millisecond kinetics.

Though many studies have uncovered significant molecular distinctions between astrocytes from different brain regions, how this regionalization unfolds over development is not fully understood. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize the molecular diversity of brain cells across six developmental stages and four brain regions in the mouse and marmoset brain. Our analysis of over 170,000 single astrocyte nuclei revealed striking regional heterogeneity among astrocytes, particularly between telencephalic and diencephalic regions, at all developmental time points surveyed in both species. At the stages sampled, most of the region patterning was private to astrocytes and not shared with neurons or other glial types. Though astrocytes were already regionally patterned in late embryonic stages, this region-specific astrocyte gene expression signature changed dramatically over postnatal development, and its composition suggests that regional astrocytes further specialize postnatally to support their local neuronal circuits. Comparing across species, we found divergence in the expression of astrocytic region- and age-differentially expressed genes and the timing of astrocyte maturation relative to birth between mouse and marmoset, as well as hundreds of species differentially expressed genes. Finally, we used expansion microscopy to show that astrocyte morphology is largely conserved across gray matter forebrain regions in the mouse, despite substantial molecular divergence.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Gs-coupled GPCRs are thought to achieve this by internalizing and allosterically activating cognate G proteins again on the endosome membrane. Here we demonstrate that the -opioid receptor (MOR), a Gi- coupled GPCR, increases endosomal G protein activity in a different way. Leveraging conformational biosensors, we resolve the subcellular activation dynamics of endogenously expressed MOR and Gi/o-subclass G proteins. We show that MOR activation triggers a transient increase of active-state Gi/o on the plasma membrane that is followed by a prolonged increase on endosomes. Contrary to the Gs-coupled GPCR paradigm, however, we show that the MOR- induced increase of active-state Gi/o on endosomes requires neither internalization of MOR nor activation of MOR in the endosome membrane. We propose a distinct and additional cellular mechanism for GPCR-triggered elevation of G protein activity on endosomes that is mediated by regulated trafficking of the activated G protein rather than its activating GPCR.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

While molecular docking has long been employed for epitope identification, it requires substantial expertise. With the advent of AI driven tools, epitope identification has become more accessible to a broader community increasing the risk of models misinterpretation. In this study, we critically evaluate the nanobody epitope prediction performance of two leading models: AlphaFold3 and AlphaFold2-Multimer (v.2.3.2), highlighting their strengths and limitations. Our analysis revealed that the overall success rate remains below 50% for both tools, with AlphaFold3 achieving a modest overall improvement. Interestingly, a significant improvement in the performance of AlphaFold3 was observed within a specific nanobody class. To address this discrepancy, we explored factors influencing epitope identification, demonstrating that accuracy heavily depends on CDR3 characteristics, such as its 3D spatial conformation and length, which drive binding interactions with the antigen. Additionally, we assessed the robustness of the confidence metrics of AlphaFold3, highlighting their potential for broader applications. Finally, we evaluated different strategies aimed at improving prediction success rate. This study can be extended to assess the accuracy of emerging deep learning models adopting a similar approach to AlphaFold3.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

A key feature of the transition to MASH involves oxidative stress resulting from defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here, we show that pathological alterations in the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) directly instigate electron transfer inefficiency to promote oxidative stress. Specifically, cardiolipin (CL) was downregulated across four mouse models of MASLD. Hepatocyte-specific CL synthase knockout (CLS-LKO) led to spontaneous MASH with elevated mitochondrial electron leak. Loss of CL interfered with the ability of coenzyme Q (CoQ) to transfer electrons, promoting leak primarily at sites IIF and IIIQ0. Data from human liver biopsies revealed a highly robust correlation between mitochondrial CL and CoQ, co-downregulated with MASH. Thus, reduction in mitochondrial CL promotes oxidative stress and contributes to pathogenesis of MASH.

Because interareal alpha synchrony is thought to facilitate long-range communication in healthy brains, coherence measures of resting-state alpha oscillations may provide insights into a patients capacity for higher-order cognition beyond channel-wise estimates of alpha power. In multi-channel EEG, global coherence methods may be used to augment standard spectral analysis methods by both estimating the strength and identifying the structure of coherent oscillatory networks. We performed global coherence analysis in 95 separate clinical EEG recordings (28 healthy controls and 33 patients with acute or chronic DoC, 25 of whom returned for follow-up) collected between two academic medical centers. We found that posterior alpha coherence is associated with recovery of higher-level cognition. We developed a measure of network organization, based on the distance between eigenvectors of the alpha cross-spectral matrix, that detects recovery of posterior alpha networks. In patients who have emerged from a minimally conscious state, we showed that coherence-based alpha networks are reconfigured prior to restoration of alpha power to resemble those seen in healthy controls. This alpha network measure performs well in classifying recovery from DoC (AUC = 0.78) compared to common representations of functional connectivity using the weighted phase lag index (AUC = 0.50 - 0.57). Lastly, we observed that activity within these alpha networks is suppressed during positive responses to task-based EEG command-following paradigms, supporting the potential utility of this biomarker to detect covert cognition. Our findings suggest that restored alpha networks may represent a sensitive early signature of cognitive recovery in patients with DoC. Therefore, network detection methods may augment the utility of EEG assessments for DoC.","NA","medrxiv",1728857339807

Here, we report that the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora enters apple leaves through naturally-occurring wounds caused by the abscission of trichomes during the course of leaf development. Through macroscopic and microscopic observations, we depicted a clear invasion path for E. amylovora cells, from epiphytic growth on glandular trichomes (GT) and non-glandular trichomes (NT), to entry through wounds caused by abscised trichomes, into the epithem, and subsequent spread through xylem. We further observed that GT and NT undergo an abscission process, and that the amount of naturally-occurring wounds during abscission is associated with the increase in E. amylovora population. Key genes important for the colonization of GT and NT were identified. Contribution of the type III secretion system and amylovoran biosynthesis during GT colonization was validated.

However, most of these studies have been limited by their focus on mammalian systems. Here, we aimed to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that are active during lung growth and tissue repair in amphibians, specifically Xenopus tropicalis (X. tropicalis). First, we analyzed the stem cell composition and signaling pathways that are active in epithelial and mesenchymal cells during lung growth. Then, we established a protocol for lung injury to assess the types of stem cells underlying tissue repair. In mammals, Sftpc+ (AT2) cells are alveolar stem cells that can differentiate to Krt8+ cells during lung homeostasis and post-injury repair. In this study, we identified Sftpc+ cells and Krt8+ cells, along with the activity of key developmental signaling pathways, Hippo and Wnt, during lung maturation at post-metamorphosis stages. We then established a protocol for lung injury using chemically induced injury with bleomycin, which damages the lung through oxidative stress. The results show an elevation in collagen post-injury, indicating bleomycin's effect in causing lung fibrosis. X. tropicalis froglets survived 42 days post-injury, with a continuous decrease in fibrosis. To explore this effect, we analyzed the distribution of lung stem cells; Sox9 protein levels and Sftp gene expression were downregulated at the alveoli 42 days post-injury. The decrease in stem cell marker expression 42 days post-injury suggests they are differentiating as part of the healing process. Nevertheless, we could still detect them after a few weeks of healing. These results suggest that X. tropicalis has a regenerative capacity for lung tissue repair and that the same signaling pathways and stem cells are active in both amphibians and mammalian lungs during lung growth, regeneration, and healing. These findings show for the first time the physiological similarities between the anuran and the mammalian lung during growth and tissue repair processes, suggesting X. tropicalis as a potential animal model to study lung regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

In the field of invertebrate acoustic communication, reconstructing the acoustic properties of sound-producing forewings in crickets has been based on two very divergent methods, finite element modelling (FEM) and vibrometric measurements from preserved specimens. Both methods, however, make strong simplifying assumptions which have not been tested and the reliability of inferences made from either method remains in question. Here we rigorously test and refine both reconstruction methods using the well-known Teleorgryllus oceanicus model system and determine the appropriate conditions required to reconstruct the vibroacoustic behaviour of male forewings. We find that when using FEM it is not necessary to assume simplified boundary conditions if the appropriate parameters are found. When using preserved specimens, we find that the sample needs to be rehydrated for reliable reconstruction, however, it may be possible to accomplish rehydration in silico using FEM. Our findings provide a refined methodology for the reliable reconstruction of cricket songs, whether from fossils or preserved specimens from museums or field collections.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Major bodies of ecological theory have emerged, largely independently, to address temperature and resource effects. It remains a major challenge to unite these ideas and determine the interactive effects of temperature and resources on ecological patterns and processes, and their consequences across ecological scales. Here, we propose a simple, physiologically motivated model capturing the interactive effects of temperature and resources (including inorganic nutrients and light) on the growth of microbial ectotherms over multiple ecological scales. From this model we derive a set of key predictions. At the population level, we predict (i) interactive effects of resource limitation on thermal traits, (ii) consistent differences in the temperature sensitivity of auto- and heterotrophs, and (iii) the existence of specific tradeoffs between traits that determine the shape of thermal performance curves. At the community level, we derive predictions for (iv) how limitation by nutrients and light can change the relationship between temperature and productivity. All four predictions are upheld, based on our analyses of a large compilation of laboratory data on microbial growth, as well as field experiments with marine phytoplankton communities. Collectively, our modeling framework provides a new way of thinking about the interplay between two fundamental aspects of life -- temperature and resources -- and how they constrain and structure ecological properties across scales. Providing links between population and community responses to simultaneous changes in abiotic factors is essential to anticipating the multifaceted effects of global change.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

However, their evolutionary conservation and functional roles remain largely unexplored. Comparative genomics, particularly through sequence conservation analysis, offers a promising approach to infer lncRNA functions. Traditional methods focusing on protein-coding genes (PCGs) fall short due to the rapid evolutionary divergence of lncRNA sequences. To address this, a workflow combining syntenic methods and motif analysis via the Mercator- Pecan genome alignment was developed and applied across 13 vertebrate species, from zebrafish to various amniotes and birds. Further analyses to infer functionality revealed co-expression patterns through 17 shared tissues between human and chicken but also functional short-motif enrichment across the 13 species using the LncLOOM tool, exemplified by the human OTX2-AS1 and its counterparts in other species. The study expanded the catalog of conserved lncRNAs, providing insights into their evolutionary conservation and information related to potential functions. The workflow presented serves as a robust tool for investigating lncRNA conservation across species, supporting future research in molecular biology to elucidate the roles of these enigmatic transcripts.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Over the past five decades, numerous methodologies have been employed to elucidate the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated tumor control. While significant progress has been made in elucidating the interactions between NK cells and tumor cells, the regulatory factors governing NK cell-mediated tumor cell destruction are not yet fully understood. This includes the diverse array of tumor ligands recognized by NK cells and the mechanisms that NK cells employ to eliminate tumor cells. Methods In this study, we employed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening approach in conjunction with functional cytotoxicity assays to delineate the proteins modulating the susceptibility of colon adenocarcinoma HCT-116 cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Results Analysis of guide RNA (gRNA) distribution in HCT-116 cells that survived co-incubation with NK cells identified ICAM-1 as a pivotal player in the NKp44-mediated immune synapse, with NKp44 serving as an activating receptor crucial for the elimination of HCT-116 tumor cells by NK cells. Furthermore, disruption of genes involved in the apoptosis or IFN-{gamma} signaling pathways conferred resistance to NK cell attack. We further dissected that NK cell-derived IFN-{gamma} promotes mitochondrial apoptosis in vitro and exerts control over B16-F10 lung metastases in vivo. Conclusion Monitoring ICAM-1 levels on the surface of tumor cells or modulating its expression should be considered in the context of NK cell-based therapy. Additionally, considering the diffusion properties of IFN-gamma, our findings highlight the potential of leveraging NK cell-derived IFN-gamma to enhance direct tumor cell killing and facilitate bystander effects via cytokine diffusion, warranting further investigation.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Zymoseptoria tritici, an important fungal pathogen of wheat, has a compartmentalized and rapidly evolving genome. In the genome of the reference isolate Z. tritici IPO323, 8 of the 21 chromosomes are accessory. In spite of the profound impact on genome organization, the origin of accessory chromosomes in Z. tritici is still poorly understood. Combining genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics, we discovered a new chromosome in Z. tritici isolates infecting wild grasses from the genus Aegilops, and we use this discovery to study the origin of accessory chromosomes. The newly identified chromosome presents similar characteristics to known accessory chromosomes in Zymoseptoria species, including presence-absence variation, low gene expression in vitro and in planta, and enrichment with heterochromatin-associated histone methylation marks (H3K27me3). Interestingly, we found an orthologous chromosome in Zymoseptoria ardabiliae, a closely related fungal species also infecting wild grasses. This ortholog chromosome also presents accessory chromosomes characteristics, but lacks the enrichment of heterochromatin-associated methylation marks. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the orthologous chromosome in Z. ardabiliae harbors active transposable elements (TEs) congruent with lower signatures of host-genome defense mechanisms against TE expansion and spread (quantified as repeat-induced-point (RIP) mutation signatures). Our findings suggest that the chromosome has been exchanged between Z. tritici and Z. ardabiliae by introgressive hybridization events underlining the relevance of hybridization in the evolution of new accessory chromosomes. We speculate that the regulation of TEs has not yet occurred on this new accessory chromosome in Z. ardabiliae, contributing to its rapid evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Using the Olink inflammatory panel, we measured the expression of 92 proteins in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (n=55) and non-COVID-19 individuals (n=23). We identified distinct inflammatory proteomic signatures in acute severe COVID-19 individuals (n=22) compared to asymptomatic or mild/moderate COVID-19 cases (n=33), and non-COVID-19 controls. Levels of SLAMF1, CCL25, IL2RB, IL10RA, IL15RA, IL18 and CST5 were significantly upregulated in patients with critical COVID-19 illness compared to individuals negative for COVID-19. The cohort was followed for an average of 20 months, and 23 individuals developed Long COVID, based on the WHOs case definition, while 32 COVID-19 patients recovered fully. Whereas upregulated levels of SLAMF1, TNF, TSLP, IL15RA, IL18, ADA, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL17C, and NT3 at the acute phase of the illness were associated with increased Long COVID risk, upregulated expression of TRANCE was associated with a reduced risk of developing Long COVID.

Bi-directional transcription of the repeat expansion generates sense and antisense repeat RNAs that can then be translated in all reading frames to produce six distinct dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins with unique termini. The precise site of translation initiation of these proteins within the C9ORF72 repeat expansion remains elusive. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and steric-blocking antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to investigate the contribution of different AUG codons in the antisense repeat RNA to the production of DPR proteins, poly(GP) and poly(PR) in C9ORF72 expansion carrier motor neurons and lymphoblast cells. We then utilized ASOs targeting C9ORF72 sense repeat RNA to examine whether sense or antisense RNA is the major source of the poly(GP) protein - a question for which conflicting evidence exists. We found that these ASOs reduced the intended sense RNA target, but also the antisense RNA, thus preventing the production of poly(PR). Our data highlights the importance of the sequences preceding the antisense CCCCGG repeat expansion for the synthesis of antisense DPR proteins and supports the use of sense C9ORF72 ASOs to prevent the accumulation of both sense- and antisense-dependent DPR proteins in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Animals often use cues to assess reward availability and to make predictions about future outcomes. The gustatory region of the insular cortex (IC), the so-called gustatory cortex, has a well-established role in the representation of predictive cues, such that IC neurons encode both a general form of outcome expectation as well as anticipatory outcome-specific knowledge. Here, we used Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) in male rats to assess if the IC is also required for predictive cues to exert both a general and specific influence over instrumental actions. Chemogenetic inhibition of IC abolished the ability of a reward-predictive stimulus to energize instrumental responding for reward. This deficit in general transfer was evident whether the same or different outcomes were used in the Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning phases. We observed a similar deficit in specific PIT, such that rats with IC inhibition failed to use a reward-predictive stimulus to guide choice toward actions that deliver the same food reward. Finally, we show that rats with IC inhibition also fail to show outcome-selective reinstatement. Together, these data suggest a crucial role for IC in the representation of appetitive outcomes, and particularly in using this representation to guide instrumental action.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

They are formed by two or more alpha helices that wind around a central axis to form a buried hydrophobic core. Various forms of coiled-coil bundles have been reported, each characterized by the number, orientation, and degree of winding of the constituent helices. This variability is underpinned by short sequence repeats that form coiled coils and whose properties determine both their overall topology and the local geometry of the hydrophobic core. The strikingly repetitive sequence has enabled the development of accurate sequence-based coiled-coil prediction methods; however, the modeling of coiled-coil domains remains a challenging task. In this work, we evaluated the accuracy of AlphaFold2 in modeling coiled-coil domains, both in modeling local geometry and in predicting global topological properties. Furthermore, we show that the prediction of the oligomeric state of coiled-coil bundles can be achieved by using the internal representations of AlphaFold2, with a performance better than any previous state-of-the-art method (code available at https://github.com/labstructbioinf/dc2_oligo).","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

We purified three single domain heavy chain antibodies (VHHs) after immunization of an alpaca with the ectodomain of ACE2. These VHHs bound ACE2 with nanomolar affinity and specifically detected membrane-anchored ACE2.

When administrated prophylactically and intranasally, B07-Fc induced a strong dose-dependent protection of mice expressing human ACE2 (K18-hACE2) from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. Hamsters were weakly protected due to low binding of B07-Fc to hamster ACE2.

Confidently identifying lipids in samples is a prerequisite for understanding the multiple functions lipids fulfill in health and disease. However, the accurate identification of molecular lipid species based on tandem mass spectrometry data is still a key challenge in lipidomics. Most current approaches rely on using a custom pipeline to process and match the measured spectra against an in-house spectra reference library, which hinders the comparability of results. To address this challenge, a transformer model called LipiDetective was developed and trained on a dataset composed of reference spectra measured from lipid standards, spectra from databases, and published experiments, utilizing both shotgun as well as liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. LipiDetective demonstrates, for the first time, that artificial neural networks can learn the characteristic lipid fragmentation patterns to automatically and accurately annotate molecular lipids species in tandem mass spectra independently of the experimental setup. The model can even correctly predict lipid species for which it has never seen a spectrum before as it is able to generalize the learned lipid fragmentation patterns. Analysis of the integrated gradients reveals that LipiDetective focuses on relevant peaks that can be matched to known fragments and are thus humanly interpretable. Therefore, LipiDetective has the potential to be a valuable tool to aid in the lipid identification process and support the comparability of results from different sources. Aside from Lipidetective as a ""ready-to-use"" application, this work primarily offers a deeper understanding of how the model functions and how future deep learning models for lipid identification in mass spectra could be improved.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Expression of RamT and RamA caused a decrease in binding of the host single strand binding protein SsbA to ssDNA.

These findings reveal how ICEBs1 can modulate key host processes, including the SOS response and homologous recombination, highlighting the complex interplay between mobile genetic elements and their bacterial hosts in adaptation and evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Current state-of-the-art models are primarily evaluated using two categories of in silico metrics: sequence-based metrics, such as amino acid recovery (AAR), and structure-based metrics, including root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), predicted alignment error (pAE), and interface predicted template modeling (ipTM). While metrics such as pAE and ipTM have been shown to be useful filters for experimental success, there is no evidence that they are suitable for ranking, particularly for antibody sequence designs. Furthermore, no reliable sequence-based metric for ranking has been established. In this work, using real-world experimental data from seven diverse datasets, we extensively benchmark a range of generative models, including LLM-style, diffusion-based, and graph-based models. We show that log-likelihood scores from these generative models correlate well with experimentally measured binding affinities, suggesting that log-likelihood can serve as a reliable metric for ranking antibody sequence designs. Additionally, we scale up one of the diffusion-based models by training it on a large and diverse synthetic dataset, significantly enhancing its ability to predict and score binding affinities.

As yet, the mechanisms governing these cell fate decisions are not well understood. Here, we report an unexpected role for the atypical E3 ligase HOIL-1 in safeguarding the ribosome. We find HOIL-1 mutations associated with cardiomyopathy broadly sensitize cells to nutrient and translational stress. These signals converge on the ribotoxic stress sentinel ZAK. Mechanistically, mutant HOIL-1 excludes a ribosome quality control E3 ligase from its functional complex and remodels the ribosome ubiquitin landscape. This quality control failure renders glucose starvation ribotoxic, precipitating a ZAK-ATF4-xCT-driven noncanonical cell death. We further show HOIL-1 loss exacerbates cardiac dysfunction under pressure overload. These data reveal an unrecognized ribosome signaling axis and a molecular circuit controlling cell fate during nutrient stress.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

We develop a combined CRISPR-screening approach using endogenous RNA and RE-reporters as readouts. Applied to the Xist locus, crucial for X-chromosome inactivation in females, this method allows us to comprehensively identify Xist-controlling TFs and map their TF-RE wiring. We find a group of transiently expressed TFs that regulate proximal REs, driving the binary activation of Xist expression. These basal activators are more highly expressed in cells with two X chromosomes, potentially driving female-specific Xist upregulation. A second set of developmental TFs is upregulated later during differentiation and targets distal REs. This regulatory axis is crucial to achieve high levels of Xist RNA, which is necessary for X-chromosome inactivation. Our findings support a model for developmental gene regulation in which factors targeting proximal REs drive binary ON-OFF decisions, while factors interacting with distal REs control the transcription output.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central tenets of medical entomology. Here, we show that male Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder when reared under dehydration conditions with no toxic effects. Mosquitoes with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates when dehydrated compared to wild-type controls. While conventionally reared males ignore a human host, dehydrated males are attracted to and attempt to probe, with some success, although they cannot access host capillaries. However, they will take blood from a vertebrate host wound. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male mosquitoes can become infected with and orally transmit the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. These data suggest that under some circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, and that their role in maintaining pathogen transmission cycles should be re-examined.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Here, we ask whether drug resistance and invasiveness coevolve to drive metastasis. Selection experiments involving pulsed carboplatin exposure established isogenic chemoresistant variants of lines, which typify high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the most aggressive type of EOC. Time-lapse imaging showed enhanced migration of resistant single cells and their collectives. Resistant cell spheroids spread faster on Collagen I substrata than sensitive controls. The resistant OVCAR-3 transcriptome was ontologically enriched for migration and showed overlap with previously reported markers of resistance in EOC patients and other evolved lines. Gene set enrichment predicted transition between epithelial, mesenchymal, and amoeboid states is higher in resistance compared to control lines. Lower matrix adhesion, weak focal adhesion, and highly deformable and translatory dynamics of cell collectives indicated that resistant cancer cells displayed a unique collective amoeboid-like migration. When injected intraperitoneally into immunodeficient mice, resistant cells colonized to a greater extent on parietal mucosae. Ex vivo, suspended resistant cells formed moruloids associated with quicker peritoneal adhesion, clearing human coelomic mesothelial monolayers with higher efficiency. Knockdown in resistant OVCAR-3 cells of two upregulated proteins, E-cadherin and LGALS3BP, had distinct consequences. E-cadherin knockdown partially restored sensitivity to carboplatin but did not affect invasion. In contrast, silencing LGALS3BP decreased invasion but not resistance. Our results suggest that drug resistance and invasiveness could coevolve through the upregulation of distinct trait drivers in EOC.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

This gating mechanism has been proposed to involve extracellular tether proteins that may transfer force from the matrix to the channel7, the so-called force from tether model8. The molecular nature of such tethers has, however, remained elusive. Here we identify the type II membrane protein Teneurin-4 (TENM4) as an essential component for mechanosensory transduction in the vast majority of cutaneous mechanoreceptors, including fast conducting nociceptors. Sensory neuron specific genetic ablation of Tenm4 in mice led to profound touch insensitivity. We devised a strategy to rapidly and reversibly disassemble the TENM4 protein at sensory endings, demonstrating its direct involvement in sensory transduction. TENM4 has been primarily studied in the context of neural development, but here we provide evidence that it transfers force to mechanically activated channels like PIEZO2 and ELKIN1, with which it associates.

Prediction and analysis of essential genes/proteins are crucial for uncovering the mechanisms of cells. Using bioinformatics and high throughput technologies, forecasting essential genes/proteins by Protein Protein Interaction (PPI) networks have become more efficient than traditional approaches which use expensive and time consuming experimental methods. Previous studies have found that the essentiality of genes closely relates to their properties in PPI network. In this work, we propose a supervised deep model for predicting human essential genes using neighboring details of genes/proteins in the PPI network. Our approach implements a weight-biased random walk on PPI network to get the node network context. Then, some different measures are used to get some feature vectors for each node (gene/protein) that preserve the network structure as well as the gene's properties in the PPI network. These feature vectors are then fed to a Relational AutoEncoder to embed the genes' features into latent space. At last, these embedded features are put into a trained classifier to predict the human essential genes. The prediction results on two human PPI networks show that our model achieves better performance than those that only refer to genes' centrality properties in the network.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Essential or highly expressed proteins evolve more slowly, and within a protein, different amino acid sites evolve at different rates. Accurately modeling this variation is critical for identifying structurally or functionally important amino acid sites. Standard methods such as Rate4Site assume independent substitution rates across sites, and the most conserved ones are widely distributed in protein tertiary structure. This is biologically unrealistic because functional sites often cluster together. Here, we developed CONSTRUCT, an improved strategy for identifying functional and structurally important regions in protein tertiary structure. Given a set of orthologous sequences, CONSTRUCT first calculates site-specific substitution rates using the Rate4site model, which are then weighted by the rates of neighboring amino acid sites within a range of window sizes. The optimal window size is determined by the strongest spatial correlation, if present. This method can be analyzed using either C atoms or the center of mass of amino acid sites to account for side chain orientation. Validation on 14 functionally characterized proteins of different size, conservation level and kingdom/domain of species has demonstrated the relevance of CONSTRUCT.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

However, it is largely unclear how these reference genome updates may impact DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis. Results: Compared to the previous GRCh38 assembly, we found an average increase of 7.4% (range 5.4%-9.9% across samples and sequencing methods) in the number of CpGs genome-wide using T2T-CHM13 with data from four commonly used short-read sequencing DNAm profiling methods. The increase in number of CpGs facilitated discovery of 88 new differentially methylated CpGs within cancer driver genes in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of colon cancer. Further, by aligning probe sequences from the commonly used and recently released Illumina DNAm arrays to T2T-CHM13 and GRCh38, we showed the enhanced utility of T2T-CHM13 for evaluation of potential probe cross-reactivity (i.e., where probes match multiple regions) and mismatch (i.e., where probes do not perfectly match the target region), resulting in the identification of new and more reproducible sets of unambiguous probes (i.e., probes uniquely mapping to the target region) (HM450K, n = 430,719; EPIC, n = 777,491; EPICv2, n = 859,216). In EWASs of 24 cancer types, an average of 945 additional differentially methylated CpG sites were identified in the new unambiguous probe set rather than in the GRCh38-based unambiguous probe set, with enrichments in cancer driver genes and cancer signaling pathways. Moreover, the pangenome called 4.5% more CpGs on average in short-read sequencing data than T2T-CHM13 and identified cross-population and population-specific unambiguous probes in DNAm arrays, owing to its improved representation of genetic diversity. These additional CpGs were overlapped with the promoters and gene bodies of various biologically and medically relevant genes and pangenome-based unambiguous probes can potentially facilitate the discovery of DNAm alterations in more than 200 cancer driver genes in each cancer type. Conclusions: Use of T2T-CHM13 and pangenome references can benefit epigenome-wide association studies by including CpGs previously unobserved in short-read sequencing data and by improving the identification of unambiguous probes for DNAm arrays, thus expanding biologically relevant information. This study highlights the practical applications of T2T-CHM13 and pangenome for genome biology and provides a basis for expansion of epigenetics investigations.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that functions to activate interferon response upon detecting viral DNA in the cytoplasm. cGAS contributes to inflammaging by responding to endogenous signals such as damaged DNA or LINE1 (L1) cDNA which forms in aged cells. While cGAS knockout mice are viable their aging has not been examined. Unexpectedly, we found that cGAS knockout mice exhibit accelerated aging phenotype associated with induction of inflammation. Transcription of L1 elements was increased in both cGAS knockout mice and in cGAS siRNA knockdown cells associated with high levels of cytoplasmic L1 DNA and expression of ORF1 protein. Cells from cGAS knockout mice showed increased chromatin accessibility and decreased DNA methylation on L1 transposons. Stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) showed that cGAS forms nuclear condensates that co-localize with H3K9me3 heterochromatin marks, and H3K9me3 pattern is disrupted in cGAS knockout cells. Taken together these results suggest a previously undescribed role for cGAS in maintaining heterochromatin on transposable elements. We propose that loss of cGAS leads to loss of chromatin organization, de-repression of transposable elements and induction of inflammation resulting in accelerated aging.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

In this study, we investigated selective neural tracking of the attended speaker under adverse listening conditions. Using EEG recordings in a multi-talker speech perception task with varying SNR, participants' speech perception was assessed through a repeated-word detection task, while neural responses were analyzed to decode the attended talker.

Here, we address this gap using radiotelemetry to track social interactions in a population of wild mice over 10 years, from 2013 to 2023, and interpret these interactions in the context of passive acoustic monitoring data collected from August 2022 until November 2023. Using deep convolutional neural networks, we identify 1.3 million individual vocalizations and align them in time with continuously collected telemetry data recording social interactions between individually identifiable mice. We find that vocalization is seasonal and correlated with long-term dynamics in features of social groups. In addition, we find that vocalization is closely associated in time with entrances to and exits from those groups, occurs most often in the presence of pups, and is correlated with how much time pairs of mice spend together. This work identifies seasonal patterns in the vocalizations of wild mice and lays a foundation to investigate the social role of acoustic communication in wild populations of a classic laboratory model organism.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Although commensal bacteria display host preference, their beneficial impact on their cognate host and mechanisms of species selection by the plant are still unclear. We use bacterial culture collections derived from the two model species Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and Lotus japonicus (Lj) to design synthetic communities (SynComs) and test their protective function upon exposure of At Col-0 to the detrimental root-colonizing Pseudomonas isolate R401. Lj-derived SynComs were fully protective, whereas At-derived SynComs displayed full protective activity only towards a R401 mutant impaired in the production of inhibitory exometabolites. The protective phenotypes were associated with a reduced titer of the R401 opportunistic pathogen. In vitro antagonist assays, in planta and in vitro bacterial community profiling, as well as strain-swapping and strain-dropout experiments revealed that competition among commensal Pseudomonas strains and R401 determines the success of the opportunist, independent of the original host or the phylogeny of the commensals. Furthermore, we determine the carbon utilization potential of these isolates, which may explain the competition with the detrimental strain and the role of host-secreted compounds. Our results provide evidence that intra-genus interactions within SynComs modulate plant health and disease, and that an individual beneficial strain can be sufficient to outcompete an opportunistic relative. This has implications for the successful development of beneficial microbial consortia for agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

A typical human cell expresses over 200 different SLCs, yet their collective influence on cell phenotypes is not well understood due to overlapping substrate specificities and expression patterns. To address this, we performed systematic pairwise gene double knockouts using CRISPR-Cas12a and -Cas9 in human colon carcinoma cells. A total of 1,088,605 guide combinations were used to interrogate 35,421 SLC-SLC and SLC-enzyme double knockout combinations across multiple growth conditions, uncovering 1,236 genetic interactions with a growth phenotype. Further exploration of an interaction between the mitochondrial citrate/malate exchanger SLC25A1 and the zinc transporter SLC39A1 revealed an unexpected role for SLC39A1 in metabolic reprogramming and anti-apoptotic signaling.

Attachment of phages to bacterial cells is a crucial initial step of the interaction. The classic assay to quantify the dynamics of phage attachment involves co-culturing and enumeration of bacteria and phages, which is laborious, lengthy, hence low-throughput, and only provides ensemble estimates of model-based adsorption rate constants. Here, we utilized fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking to obtain trajectories of individual virus particles interacting with cells. The trajectory durations quantified the heterogeneity in dwell time, the time that each phage spends interacting with a bacterium. The average dwell time strongly correlated with the classically-measured adsorption rate constant. We successfully applied this technique to quantify host-attachment dynamics of several phages including those targeting key bacterial pathogens. This approach should benefit the field of phage biology by providing highly quantitative, model-free readouts at single-virus resolution, helping to uncover single-virus phenomena missed by traditional measurements. Owing to significant reduction in manual effort, our method should enable rapid, high-throughput screening of a phage library against a target bacterial strain for applications such as therapy or diagnosis.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Plasma-positive microglia are characterized by prominent expression of genes related to innate immunity and antigen presentation and exhibit high metabolic and phagocytic activity. This activity is dependent, in part, on microglial uptake and accumulation of circulatory Apolipoprotein AI (ApoA-I).

These sequences, known as spacers, are inserted into the CRISPR locus by the Cas1-Cas2 integrase complex and mediate sequence- specific immunity in prokaryotes. Spacer acquisition has been used to develop unique biotechnological applications such as the immunization of industrially relevant bacteria against bacteriophage infection and the recording of biological signals into stable genetic information. These technologies, however, are constrained by the low efficiency of the spacer acquisition process. To overcome this limitation, we developed a genetic system that combined deep mutational scanning (DMS) of cas genes from the Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A CRISPR- Cas system with a method that selects bacteria that acquire new spacers. This procedure enabled the identification of cas mutations that support up to a sevenfold increase in the levels of spacer acquisition and a significant enhancement of immunity against phage infection. In addition, our analysis revealed key interactions at the Cas1-Cas2 interface critical for spacer integration. Our findings provide insights into the molecular determinants of spacer acquisition and offer a platform to improve CRISPR-Cas-based applications.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

We i) used chemically modified gRNAs to allow more penetrant loss-of-function phenotypes, ii) improved nuclear RNA-targeting, and iii) compared different computational models and determined the most accurate to predict gRNA activity in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that transient CRISPR-RfxCas13d can effectively deplete endogenous mRNAs in zebrafish embryos without inducing collateral effects, except when targeting extremely abundant and ectopic RNAs. Finally, we implemented alternative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems with reduced or absent collateral activity. Altogether, these findings contribute to CRISPR-Cas technology optimization for RNA targeting in zebrafish through transient approaches and assist in the progression of in vivo applications.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCEs embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Upon activation, eosinophils release cytotoxic proteins such as major basic protein-1 (MBP-1) from cytoplasmic secretory granules (SGr) wherein MBP-1 is stored as nanocrystals. How the MBP-1 nanocrystalline core is formed, stabilized, and subsequently mobilized remains unknown. Here, we report the in-situ structure of crystalline MBP-1 within SGrs of human eosinophils. The structure reveals a mechanism for intragranular crystal packing and stabilization of MBP-1 via a structurally conserved loop region that is associated with calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding in other C-type lectin (CTL) proteins. Single-cell and single-SGr profiling correlating real-space three-dimensional information from cellular montage cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data obtained from non-activated and IL33-activated eosinophils revealed activation-dependent crystal expansion and extrusion of expanded crystals from SGr.

Latin American samples are significantly underrepresented in global cancer genomics studies, which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures. To address this, here we characterise the genome and transcriptome of 128 acral melanoma tumours from 96 Mexican patients, a population notable because of its genetic admixture. Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer frequent mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF, NRAS or NF1. While most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations and a lower number of structural variants. These BRAF-mutated tumours have a transcriptional profile similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, suggesting that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared to other tumours arising in these locations. KIT mutations were found in a subset of these tumours, and transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with overall survival. We highlight novel low-frequency drivers, such as SPHKAP, which correlate with a distinct genomic profile and clinical characteristics.

Participants were divided into three groups: drug abuse, psilocybin mushrooms, and unknown mushrooms. The clinical outcomes evaluated were non-hospitalization, hospitalization, and death. To analyze associations between categorical variables, we applied the Chi-square test ({chi}{superscript 2}).

Alcohol (n = 71.824; 49.2%) (p < 0.001) was the primary toxic agent. Hospitalization and mortality rates in the drug abuse group were 19.5% (n = 21,923) and 1.8% (n = 2035), respectively. Psilocybin mushroom group included 13 adverse events, which represents 0.02% of all hospitalizations (n = 6; 46.2%). Unknown mushroom group accounted for 51 adverse events, comprising 0.04% of hospitalizations (n = 12; 23.5%). There were no fatalities in either the psilocybin or unknown mushroom groups. Most hospitalizations involved alcohol (45.0%) and deaths represented mainly by cocaine (33.3%).

ConclusionWhile our findings suggest that psilocybin mushrooms present a low-risk profile of adverse events, underreporting is a possibility. Given the increasing public interest in psilocybin mushrooms, this study underscores the importance of evidence-based regulatory discussions to prevent arbitrary arrests and ensure safe access to psilocybin for both clinical and ceremonial purposes.","NA","medrxiv",1728857339807

To address these limitations we developed a soft, composite yield-stress extracellular matrix that supports optimal organoid morphogenesis following freeform 3D bioprinting of cell slurries at tissue-like densities. The material is designed with two temperature regimes: at 4 {degrees}C it exhibits reversible yield-stress behavior to support long printing times without compromising cell viability. When transferred to cell culture at 37 {degrees}C, the material cross-links and exhibits similar viscoelasticity and plasticity to basement membrane extracts such as Matrigel. We first characterize the rheological properties of MAGIC matrices that optimize organoid morphogenesis, including low stiffness and high stress relaxation. Next, we combine this material with a custom piezoelectric printhead that allows more reproducible and robust self-organization from uniform and spatially organized tissue ""seeds."" We apply MAGIC matrix bioprinting for high-throughput generation of intestinal, mammary, vascular, salivary gland, and brain organoid arrays that are structurally similar to those grown in pure Matrigel, but exhibit dramatically improved homogeneity in organoid size, shape, maturation time, and efficiency of morphogenesis. The flexibility of this method and material enabled fabrication of fully 3D microphysiological systems, including perfusable organoid tubes that experience cyclic 3D strain in response to pressurization. Furthermore, the reproducibility of organoid structure increased the statistical power of a drug response assay by up to 8 orders-of-magnitude for a given number of comparisons. Combined, these advances lay the foundation for the efficient fabrication of complex tissue morphologies by canalizing their self-organization in both space and time.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Although uropathogenesis has been studied extensively in the context of macromolecular interactions, the degree to which metabolism may contribute to infection is unclear. Currently, most of what is known about the metabolic capacity of uropathogens has been derived from genomics, genetic knockout studies or transcriptomic analyses. However, there are currently very little empirical data on the metabolic activity of uropathogens when grown in urine. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic survey of the metabolic activities of eight of the most common uropathogenic bacterial species that collectively represent 99% of uncomplicated UTIs. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses of human urine cultures revealed that uropathogens have four distinct metabolic clades. We generalized these clades as serine consumers (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis), glutamine consumers (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), amino acid abstainers (Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), and amino acid minimalists (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus). These metabolic classifications can be further subdivided on a species-to-species level. This survey provides a framework to understanding the metabolic activity of the diverse range of uropathogens and how these species use divergent metabolic strategies to occupy the same niche.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Nonetheless, these are often examined at the individual level, while societal-environmental exposures and their association with anxiety disorders are under-researched, especially in the Israeli context. This study leverages 19 years of longitudinal data from a large healthcare organization to examine the impact of national security instability on short-term anxiolytic purchases in Israel.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records of over 1.1 million individuals from 2006 to 2024, examining rates of first-time and renewed use of anxiolytic medications of the benzodiazepines group during periods of armed conflict, including military operations and wars. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations, adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, socioreligious sector, residence and previous psychiatric treatment.

ResultsThe risk for first purchase of an anxiety-relief short terms medication during military operations was 28% higher (HR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.21-1.34) compared to periods of relative national stability, after adjustments, and 44% higher during the Second Lebanon War (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27-1.62). The events of October 7th were the most significant armed conflict increasing the risk for anxiety-related reaction necessitating treatment throughout the 19-years follow-up, with individuals at 317% increased risk for treatment initiation compared to periods of relative national stability (HR 4.17, 95% CI 3.97-4.38). Alongside a baseline increased risk for initiating anti-anxiety treatment, women experienced an additional elevated risk for anxiolytic therapy during times of national security threats, with 26% additional increased risk during military operations and an 81% increased risk following the events of October 7th. Residents of northern Israel had an increased risk of purchasing anxiolytics during the Second Lebanon War (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.12-1.72), while during military operations it was the residents of southern Israel who faced an increased risk for anxiolytic usage, with an HR of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05-1.33). Conversely, the residential region did not significantly influence anti-anxiety treatment patterns following October 7th among residents of southern or northern Israel, compared to individuals living in central Israel, indicating a broader national impact beyond regional differences.

ConclusionsNational armed conflicts significantly influence anxiolytic medication use in Israel, with the October 7th war showing the most pronounced effect. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive mental health interventions during times of national crisis, focusing on both short-term relief and long-term mental health support to prevent dependency and improve mental health outcomes in the wake of national crises.","NA","medrxiv",1728857339807

While the Iron Age was comparable to contemporary European regions, the gene pool of Central Italy underwent significant influence from Near Eastern ancestry during the Imperial age. To explain this shift, it has been proposed that during this period people from Eastern Mediterranean regions of the Empire migrated towards its political center. In this study, by analyzing a new individual (1.25x) and published Republican samples, we propose a novel perspective for the presence of Near Eastern ancestry in the Imperial gene pool. In our scenario, the spread of this genetic ancestry took place during the late Republican period, predating the onset of the Empire by [~]200 years. The diffusion of this ancestry may have occurred due to early East-to-West movements, since Eastern Mediterranean regions were already under Roman political influence during the Republic, or even as a result of migration from Southern Italy where Greeks and Phoenicians settled.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

However, little is known about how this drug alters large-scale brain activity. We collected naturalistic electroencephalography (EEG) data of 29 healthy individuals before and after inhaling a high dose (12mg) of vaporised synthetic 5-MeO-DMT. We replicate work from rodents showing amplified low-frequency oscillations, but extend these findings with novel tools for characterising the organisation and dynamics of complex low-frequency spatiotemporal fields of neural activity. We find that 5-MeO-DMT radically reorganises low-frequency flows of neural activity, causing them to become incoherent, heterogeneous, viscous, fleeting, nonrecurring, and to cease their typical travelling forwards and backwards across the cortex compared to resting state. Further, we find a consequence of this reorganisation in broadband activity, which exhibits slower, more stable, low-dimensional behaviour, with increased energy barriers to rapid global shifts. These findings provide the first detailed empirical account of how 5-MeO-DMT sculpts human brain dynamics, revealing a novel set of cortical slow wave behaviours, with significant implications for extant neuroscientific models of serotonergic psychedelics.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

ObjectiveThis SLR summarizes the evidence across studies among predominately adults that report an adjusted measure of association for the relationship between vaccination and PCC, by timing of vaccination relative to infection or PCC-onset and across different study characteristics.

Evidence reviewA comprehensive search strategy was developed within the OVID platform across EMBASE, MEDLINE(R) and Evidence-Based Medicine reviews, and supplemented with WHO COVID library and Google Scholar(R) searches, to collate evidence on vaccination and PCC published or posted as pre-prints between January 1st, 2020 and July 18th, 2023. JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists were used to assess each studys risk of bias.

FindingsThis review included 97 studies and synthesized results from 56 studies with low risk of bias that reported adjusted measures for the association between vaccination and PCC. Overall, 77% of pre-infection adjusted VE (aVE) estimates (vs. unvaccinated) were statistically significant (range: 7%-95%), 80% of estimates reflecting a mix of those vaccinated before and after infection were statistically significant (range: 62%-73%), one of five estimates reflecting vaccination after PCC onset was statistically significant (aVE=41%), 43% of post-infection vaccination estimates were statistically significant (two were protective [range: 28%-40%] and one was not [aVE=-47%]), and 46% of estimates not specifying vaccination timing were statistically significant (23 were protective [range: 29%-75%] and one was not [aVE=-132%]). Statistically significant pre-infection aVE estimates were slightly higher for mRNA (range: 14%-84%) than non-mRNA vaccines (range: 16%-38%) and aVE ranges during (4 studies; range: 10%-70%) and before Omicron predominance (10 studies; range: 7%-50%) overlapped. Pre-infection vaccination was protective regardless of vaccine type, number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant variant, and severity of acute infections included.

Conclusions and RelevanceCollectively our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination received prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces the subsequent risk of developing PCC regardless of the predominant variant circulating.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo measures of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC) vary by timing of vaccine relative to SARS-CoV-2 infection or PCC onset, vaccine type and number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, and disease severity?

FindingsCOVID-19 vaccination before SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to reduce the risk of PCC (vs. unvaccinated). Compared with other COVID-19 vaccine types, mRNA vaccines seemed to offer greater protection, and a dose response was observed for mRNA vaccines.

We developed a high-throughput massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that, in a single experiment, measures the half-life of tens of thousands of unique mRNA sequences containing designed 3 UTRs. Over multiple design-build-test iterations, we have accumulated 180,000 unique measurements of mRNA stability covering unique genomic and synthetic 3 UTRs, representing the largest such dataset of sequences. We trained highly-accurate machine learning models to map from 3 UTR sequence to mRNA stability, and used them to guide the design of synthetic 3 UTRs that increase mRNA stability in cell lines. Finally, we validated the function of several ML-designed 3 UTRs in mouse models, resulting in up to 2-fold more protein production over time and 30-100-fold higher protein output at later time points compared to a commonly used benchmark. These results highlight the potential of ML-driven sequence design for mRNA therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

While traditionally viewed as a waste product, lactate is an important energy source for many organs, but first must be oxidized to pyruvate for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). This reaction is thought to occur in the cytosol, with pyruvate subsequently transported into mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Using 13C stable isotope tracing, we demonstrated that lactate is oxidized in the myocardial tissue of mice even when the MPC is genetically deleted. This MPC-independent lactate import and mitochondrial oxidation is dependent upon the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1/Slc16a1). Mitochondria isolated from the myocardium without MCT1 exhibit a specific defect in mitochondrial lactate, but not pyruvate, metabolism. The import and subsequent mitochondrial oxidation of lactate by mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) acts as an electron shuttle, generating sufficient NADH to support respiration even when the TCA cycle is disrupted. In response to diverse cardiac insults, animals with hearts lacking MCT1 undergo rapid progression to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Thus, the mitochondrial import and oxidation of lactate enables carbohydrate entry into the TCA cycle to sustain cardiac energetics and maintain myocardial structure and function under stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

However, many eukaryotic viruses, including amoeba-infecting mimiviruses, have codon usage that is largely deviated from that of their host, despite using the host machinery for translation. This raises the question of how these viruses cope with the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand. Here we show that Acanthamoeba castellanii mimivirus generates a subcellular area in the host cells to translate virus mRNAs. A combination of genome-wide ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing showed that ribosomes traversed along viral mRNAs with fewer pausing events than were observed on amoeba mRNAs. Frequently used codons in viral mRNAs had higher tRNA accessibility than the same type of codons in amoeba mRNAs. tRNA sequencing showed that the tRNA pool was not greatly altered during the infection even though the virus encodes tRNA genes. Instead, by in situ labelling, we found that viral mRNAs and newly synthesized proteins were localized at the periphery region of the viral factory, likely creating a unique environment to facilitate viral translation. Our data provide a perspective on how local translation assists the virus in overcoming the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

However, the biocultural origins of fermentation practices and microbes have largely been replaced by industrial processes. Here, we consider a historical fermentation originating from Turkey and Bulgaria - ant yogurt. We revisit the traditional practices and modern gastronomic applications that use red wood ants (Formica rufa group) to initiate milk fermentation. Subsequently, we characterize the ants and experimental ant-derived yogurts. We uncover that the ant holobiont, which consists of the ants and their microbes, contributes key acids and enzymes to fermentation. Metabarcoding and culturing revealed that lactic and acetic acid bacteria, including species related to those in conventional yogurt and sourdough, originate from the live ants and proliferate in the milk. The ants and bacteria consequently introduce formic, lactic, and acetic acid, advantageous for yogurt acidification and coagulation. Last, proteases with the potential to act on casein and alter yogurt texture are produced by the ants and bacteria. The ant holobiont thus facilitates fermentation akin to the microbial consortia in other ferments. Our findings highlight the value of integrating traditional, gastronomic, and biological frameworks to uncover the origins and applications of microbes for fermented foods.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

This isolation, combined with substantial Denisovan ancestry, contributes to the unique genetic makeup of the Papua New Guinean population. Previous research suggested the possibility of admixture with an early diverged modern human population, but the extent of this contribution remains debated. This study re-examines the demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population using newly published samples and advanced analytical methods. Our findings demonstrate that the observed shifts in relative cross coalescent rate curves are unlikely to result from technical artefacts or contributions from an earlier out of Africa population. Instead, they are likely due to a significant bottleneck and slower population growth rate within the Papua New Guinean population. Our analysis positions the Papua New Guinean population as a sister group to other Asian populations, challenging the notion of Papua New Guinean as an outgroup to both European and Asian populations. This study provides new insights into the complex demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population and underscores the importance of considering population-specific demographic events in interpreting relative cross coalescent rate curves.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Exporting this measure to the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and UK Biobank neuroimaging datasets revealed that faster DunedinPACNI predicted participants cognitive impairment, accelerated brain atrophy, and conversion to diagnosed dementia. Underscoring close links between longitudinal aging of the body and brain, faster DunedinPACNI also predicted physical frailty, poor health, future chronic diseases, and mortality in older adults. Furthermore, DunedinPACNI followed the expected socioeconomic health gradient. When compared to brain age gap, an existing MRI aging biomarker, DunedinPACNI was similarly or more strongly related to clinical outcomes.

Nevertheless, no direct link between hippocampal ripples and MSL has yet been established. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography from the hippocampus in 20 epilepsy patients during a MSL task in which participants showed steady improvement across nine 30-second training blocks interspersed with 30-second rest ( offline) periods. We first demonstrate that ripple rates strongly increase during rest periods relative to training blocks. Importantly, ripple rates during rest periods tracked learning behaviour, both across blocks and across participants.

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1728857339807

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

LoVis4u generates vector images in PDF format based on annotation data from GenBank or GFF files. It is capable of visualising entire genomes of bacteriophages as well as plasmids and user-defined regions of longer prokaryotic genomes. Additionally, LoVis4u offers optional data processing steps to identify and highlight accessory and core genes in input sequences.

Here we develop minimally invasive optical clearing media for fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues. Light scattering is minimized by adding spherical polymers with low osmolarity to the extracellular medium. A clearing medium containing bovine serum albumin (SeeDB-Live) is minimally invasive to live cells, allowing for structural and functional imaging of live tissues, such as spheroids, organoids, acute brain slices, and the mouse brain in vivo. SeeDB-Live minimally affects the electrophysiological properties and sensory responses of neurons. We demonstrate its utility for widefield imaging of subcellular voltage dynamics, such as backpropagating action potentials, in acute brain slices. We also utilize SeeDB-Live for widefield voltage imaging of dozens of dendrites in vivo, demonstrating population dynamics. Thus, SeeDB-Live expands the scale and modalities of fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Active modifications to the spatial environment could thus be a potent tool to mitigate epidemic risk. We tested whether Lasius niger ants modify their nest architecture in response to pathogens by introducing controlor pathogen-treated individuals into nest-digging groups, and monitoring three-dimensional nest morphogenesis over time. Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organisation can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements. This work introduces a novel strategy of Shared Token Representation and Encoding with Aligned Multi-masking (STREAM) and provides a state-of-the-art codon optimization framework with a customizable open-access model and a user-friendly interface.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1728857339807

Principally being a gap in technology, the HaloTag toolbox lacks affinity ligands displaying good cell permeability and efficient affinity capture. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and validation of a new cell-permeable Biotin-HaloTag ligand, which allows rapid labeling of Halo-tagged proteins in live cells and their efficient separation using streptavidin pull-down.

The approach holds immense potential for addressing fundamental questions concerning essential cellular processes, including genome duplication and chromatin maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807

TEs are epigenetically silenced to prevent harmful effects caused by either global activation leading to genome instability or insertional mutation disturbing gene transcription. However, whether the activation of a single element can contribute to pathological phenotypes without directly affecting gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we show that tissue-specific expression of a TE in the embryo leads to the production of viral-like particles (VLPs) which can affect organ formation. Failure to silence an LTR retrotransposon inserted upstream of the Fgf8 gene results in its co-expression with Fgf8 in the developing embryo. While local gene regulation is unaffected, the LTR retrotransposon participates in chromatin folding at the locus and adopts the expression of the regulatory domain it is located in. This drives the production of VLPs in the Fgf8-expressing cells of the developing limb, triggering apoptotic cell death at the time of digit outgrowth and resulting in a limb malformation resembling human ectrodactyly. This phenotype can be rescued by knock-out or knock-in of the retrotransposon causing mutations preventing its full retroviral cycle. Insertion of the same element at other developmental loci faithfully recapitulates expression according to the neighboring regulatory activity. Our findings provide a mechanism by which TE insertion is incorporated into the local genomic regulatory landscape and show how VLP production in post-implantation embryos can interfere with organ formation.","NA","biorxiv",1728857339807
