We fate-mapped the embryonic chick forebrain using lipophilic dyes and Cre-recombination lineage tracing, and built a 4D model of brain growth. We reveal modular patterns of anisotropic growth, ascribed to progenitor regions through multiplex HCR. Morphogenesis is dominated by directional growth towards the eye, more isometric expansion of the prethalamus and dorsal telencephalon, and anterior movement of ventral cells into the hypothalamus. Fate conversion experiments in chick and comparative gene expression analysis in chick and mouse support placement of the hypothalamus ventral to structures extending from the telencephalon up to and including the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI), with the dorsoventral axis becoming distorted at the base of the ZLI. Our findings challenge the widely accepted prosomere model of forebrain organisation, and we propose an alternative Tripartite Hypothalamus model.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Using single-cell RNA- and ATAC-sequencing, we analyzed mouse hypothalamic and prethalamic development from embryonic day 11 to postnatal day 8, profiling 660,000 cells in total. This identified key transcriptional and chromatin dynamics driving regionalization, neurogenesis, and differentiation. This identified multiple distinct neural progenitor populations, as well as gene regulatory networks that control their spatial and temporal identities, and their terminal differentiation into major neuronal subtypes. Integrating these results with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we identified a central role for transcription factors controlling supramammillary hypothalamic development in a broad range of metabolic and cognitive traits. Recurring cross-repressive regulatory relationships were observed between transcription factors that induced prethalamic and tuberal hypothalamic identity on the one hand and mammillary and supramammillary hypothalamic identity on the other. In postnatal animals, Dlx1/2 was found to severely disrupt GABAergic neuron specification in both the hypothalamus and prethalamus, resulting in a loss of inhibition of thalamic neurons, hypersensitivity to cold, and behavioral hyperactivity. By identifying core gene regulatory networks controlling the specification and differentiation of major hypothalamic and prethalamic neuronal cell types, this study provides a roadmap for future efforts aimed at preventing and treating a broad range of homeostatic and cognitive disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Remarkably, Starships dominate the plastic genomic compartments involved in host colonization, are enriched in virulence-associated genes, and exhibit genetic and epigenetic characteristics associated with adaptive genome evolution. We further uncover extensive horizontal transfer of Starships between Verticillium species and, strikingly, from distantly related Fusarium fungi. Finally, we demonstrate how Starship activity facilitated the de novo formation of a novel virulence gene. Our findings illuminate the profound influence of Starship dynamics on fungal genome evolution and the development of virulence.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Among bodily rhythms, respiration emerges as a key modulator of sensory processing. Multisensory integration, the non-linear combination of information from multiple senses to reduce environmental uncertainty, may be influenced by respiratory dynamics. This study investigated how respiration modulates reaction times and multisensory integration in a simple detection task. Forty healthy participants were presented with unimodal (Auditory, Visual, Tactile) and bimodal (Audio-Tactile, Audio-Visual, Visuo-Tactile) stimuli while their respiratory activity was recorded. Results revealed that reaction times systematically varied with respiration, with faster responses during peak inspiration and early expiration but slower responses during the expiration-to-inspiration transition. Applying the race model inequality approach to quantify multisensory integration, we found that Audio-Tactile and Audio-Visual stimuli exhibited the highest integration during the expiration-to-inspiration phase. These findings conceivably reflect respiration phase-locked changes in cortical excitability which in turn, orchestrates multisensory integration. Interestingly, participants also tended to adapt their respiratory cycles, aligning response onsets preferentially with early expiration. This suggests that, rather than a mere bottom-up mechanism, respiration is actively adjusted to maximise the signal-to-noise balance between interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

We developed a tool to estimate the extent of this bias. The benefits of giving intravenous immunoglobulin in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome have likely been overstated

BackgroundImmortal time bias is a spurious or exaggerated protective association that commonly arises in naive analyses of observational data. It occurs when people receive the intervention because they survive, rather than survive because they received the intervention. Studies in conditions with substantial early mortality, such as acute severe infections, are particularly vulnerable. The bias can be avoided by fitting the intervention as a time-varying exposure.

MethodsWe developed IMMORTOOL, an R package accessible via a user-friendly web interface. This tool will estimate the potential for immortal time bias using empiric or assumed data on the distributions of time to intervention and time to event. Assumptions are that no other biases are present and that the intervention does not impact the outcome. The tool was benchmarked using studies presenting both naive analyses and analyses with the intervention fit as a time-varying exposure. We applied IMMORTOOL to a set of influential observational studies that used naive analyses when estimating the impact of polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on survival in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).

ResultsIMMORTOOL demonstrated that published estimates suggesting a survival advantage from giving IVIG in STSS are explained, at least in part, by immortal time bias.

ConclusionsIMMORTOOL can quantify the potential for immortal time bias in observational analyses. This may help readers interrogate published studies. We do not advocate IMMORTOOL being used to justify naive analyses where the intervention could be fit as a time-varying exposure. To what extent giving IVIG in STSS improves survival remains uncertain.","NA","medrxiv",1736719664847

In the central nervous system (CNS), myelinated axons vary over 100-fold in diameter, with conduction speed scaling linearly with increasing diameter. Axon diameter and myelination are closely interlinked, with axon diameter exerting a strong influence on myelination. Conversely, myelinating Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system can both positively and negatively affect axon diameter. However, whether axon diameter is regulated by CNS oligodendrocytes is less clear. Here, we investigated CNS axon diameter growth in the absence of myelin using mouse (Mbpshi/shi and Myrf conditional knockout) and zebrafish (olig2 morpholino) models. We find that neither the ensheathment of axons, nor the formation of compact myelin are required for CNS axons to achieve appropriate and diverse diameters. This indicates that developmental CNS axon diameter growth is independent of myelination, and shows that myelinating cells of CNS and PNS differentially influence axonal morphology.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Despite this close interdependency between proteasome subunits, we demonstrate that knockouts from different proteasome subcomplexes result in distinct highly cellular phenotypes. In particular, depletion of 19S PSMD lid proteins, but not that of other proteasome subunits, prevents bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis, resulting in a mitotic arrest. We find that the monopolar spindle phenotype is caused by ubiquitin- independent proteasomal degradation of the motor protein KIF11 upon loss of 19S proteins. Thus, negative regulation of 20S-mediated proteasome degradation is essential for mitotic progression and 19S and 20S proteasome components can function independently outside of the canonical 26S structure. This work reveals a role for the proteasome in spindle formation and identifies the effects of ubiquitin- independent degradation on cell cycle control.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

While the literature suggests that these pathways cooperate to build the primitive streak, their individual contributions remain poorly understood, largely due to pleiotropic effects observed when key pathway components are knocked out in mouse embryos. In this study, we used gastruloids - a non-integrated stem cell model of mammalian gastrulation - to dissect the roles of Wnt and Nodal signalling. We found that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling drives a genetic program characteristic of the late primitive streak, promoting the development of posterior body structures in a time and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, Nodal signalling activates a distinct developmental module resembling the early primitive streak. By engineering gastruloids with elevated Nodal signalling, we demonstrate that the decreasing temporal gradient of Nodal activity in the mouse primitive streak likely plays a pivotal role in establishing the anterior body plan, with higher Nodal levels producing more anterior structures in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that rather than cooperating, Nodal and Wnt signalling act antagonistically, initiating distinct developmental modules within the primitive streak. This antagonism is likely the core mechanism driving the early body plan in mammals. Additionally, our results also lead to the suggestion that the gastruloid system models the primitive streak and reveals its self-organizing potential.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

A key question is how self-identification with discrete, predefined race and ethnicity categories compares to genetic diversity at continental and subcontinental levels. To contextualize the genetic diversity in All of Us, we analyzed ~2 million common variants from unrelated 230,016 whole genomes using classical population genetics methods, alongside reference panels such as the 1000 Genomes Project, Human Genome Diversity Project, and Simons Genome Diversity Project. Our analysis reveals that participants within self-identified race and ethnicity groups exhibit a gradient of genetic diversity rather than discrete clusters. The distributions of continental and subcontinental ancestries show considerable variation within race and ethnicity, both nationally and across states, reflecting the historical impacts of U.S. colonization, the transatlantic slave trade, and recent migrations. All of Us samples filled most gaps along the top five principal components of genetic diversity in current global reference panels.

Ancestry was significantly associated with body mass index (BMI) and height, even after adjusting for socio-environmental covariates. In particular, West-Central and East African ancestries showed opposite associations with BMI. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing subcontinental ancestries, as the continental approach is insufficient to control for confounding in genetic association studies.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US and it is important to monitor changes in pain during and after the pandemic. Objective: To determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential contributing factors. Methods: We analyze a nationally representative sample of 88,469 community-dwelling Americans aged 18 and older from three cross-sectional waves of the National Health Interview Survey before (2019), during (2021), and after (2023) the COVID-19 pandemic. Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; fully controlled models include 19 additional covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of long COVID. Outcomes are CP and HICP using measures proposed by the US National Pain Strategy; we also present findings for six site-specific pain measures. Results: Between 2019 and 2023, CP and HICP prevalence increased by 18% and 13%, respectively. Specifically, CP prevalence was 20.6% (95%CI: 19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023.

The increases occurred in all examined body sites except for tooth/jaw pain, and in all major population groups. Approximately 13% of the increase in CP and HICP was attributable to long COVID. Conclusions and Relevance: Pain among US adults was high before and during the pandemic but has surged substantially since.

Such goal-directed behaviour - or model-based (MB) reinforcement learning (RL) - can flexibly adapt choice to changes, being thus distinct from simpler habitual - or model-free (MF) RL - strategies. Previous inactivation and neuroimaging work implicates prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the caudate striatal region in MB-RL; however, details are scarce about its implementation at the single-neuron level. Here, we recorded from two PFC regions - the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and two striatal regions, caudate and putamen - while two rhesus macaques performed a sequential decision-making (two-step) task in which MB-RL involves knowledge about the statistics of reward and state transitions. All four regions, but particularly the ACC, encoded the rewards received and tracked the probabilistic state transitions that occurred. However, ACC (and to a lesser extent caudate) encoded the key variables of the task - namely the interaction between reward, transition and choice - which underlies MB decision-making. ACC and caudate neurons also encoded MB-derived estimates of choice values. Moreover, caudate value estimates of the choice options flipped when a rare transition occurred, demonstrating value update based on structural knowledge of the task. The striatal regions were unique (relative to PFC) in encoding the current and previous rewards with opposing polarities, reminiscent of dopaminergic neurons, and indicative of a MF prediction error. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of selective and temporally dissociable neural mechanisms underlying goal-directed behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Accurate prediction of TFBSs is essential for understanding gene regulation, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery. These studies are therefore relevant not only in humans but also in model organisms and domesticated and wild animals. However, current tools for the automatic analysis of TFBSs in gene promoter regions are limited in their usability across multiple species. To our knowledge, no tools currently exist that allow for automatic analysis of TFBSs in gene promoter regions for many species. Methodology and Findings: The TFBSFootprinter tool combines multiomic transcription-relevant data for more accurate prediction of functional TFBSs in 124 vertebrate species. In humans, this includes vertebrate sequence conservation (GERP), proximity to transcription start sites (FANTOM5), correlation of expression between target genes and TFs predicted to bind promoters (FANTOM5), overlap with ChIP-Seq TF metaclusters (GTRD), overlap with ATAC-Seq peaks (ENCODE), eQTLs (GTEx), and the observed/expected CpG ratio (Ensembl). TFBSFootprinter analyses are based on the Ensembl transcript ID for simplicity of use and require minimal setup steps. Benchmarking of the TFBSFootprinter on a manually curated and experimentally verified dataset of TFBSs produced superior results when using all multiomic data (average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.881), compared with DeepBind (0.798), FIMO (0.817) and traditional PWM (0.854). The results were further improved by selecting the best overall combination of multiomic data (0.910). Additionally, we determined combinations of multiomic data that provide the best model of binding for each TF. TFBSFootprinter is available as Conda and Python packages.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Bacterial and fungal genomes contain thousands of nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of unknown function, providing a promising resource for peptide discovery. Core structural features of such peptides can be inferred by predicting the substrate(s) of adenylation (A) domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). However, existing approaches to A domain prediction rely on limited datasets and often struggle with domains selecting large substrates or from less-studied taxa. Here, we systematically curate and computationally analyse 3,254 A domains and present two new high-accuracy specificity predictors, PARAS and PARASECT. A new type of A domain with unusually high L-tryptophan specificity was identified through the application of PARAS, and intact protein mass spectrometry to the corresponding NRPS showed it to direct the production of tryptopeptin-related metabolites in Streptomyces species. Together, these technologies will accelerate the characterisation of novel NRPSs and their metabolic products.

Using live imaging of second trimester human fetal tissue and cortical organoids, we identify two independent translocation modes for bRG cell colonization of the human neocortex. On top of an actomyosin-dependent movement called mitotic somal translocation (MST), we identify a microtubule-dependent motion occurring during interphase, that we call interphasic somal translocation (IST). We show that IST is driven by the LINC complex, through the nuclear envelope recruitment of the dynein motor and of its activator LIS1. Consequently, IST severely altered in LIS1 patient-derived cortical organoids. We also demonstrate that MST occurs during prometaphase and is a mitotic spindle translocation event. MST is controlled by the mitotic cell rounding molecular pathway, via Moesin and Vimentin, driving translocation. We report that 85% of bRG cell translocation is due to IST, for a total movement of 0,67 mm per month of human fetal gestation. Our work identifies how bRG cells colonize the human fetal cortex, and further shows that IST and MST are conserved in bRG-related migrating glioblastoma cells.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing with Cre-driver lines generated by genome editing identified cholangiocytes as the source of de novo hepatocytes.

In Ireland, limited genetic data are available regarding the diversity of Culicoides species. This study represents the first attempt to characterise Culicoides in this region using molecular techniques.

MethodsAdult Culicoides samples were captured using Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI) traps across six locations in Ireland. Subsequent molecular analyses involved polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and the internal transcriber spacer (ITS) barcoding regions to obtain species identities. Additionally, using both markers, we inferred the population genetic structure and potential colonisation pathways of Culicoides obsoletus sensu stricto (s. str.), the major vector species in Ireland.

ResultsDNA barcoding facilitated identification of 177 specimens. Eight common Culicoides species were identified through DNA barcoding of CO1 and ITS gene regions. The presence of putative vectors of Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) were also confirmed, including species in the subgenus Avaritia (C. obsoletus s. str., C. scoticus, C. chiopterus, and C. dewulfi) and subgenus Culicoides s. str. (C. pulicaris and C. punctatus). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the relationship between these vector species and facilitated the placement of Culicoides sp. which could not be identified to species level through DNA barcoding. Haplotype network analysis of C. obsoletus showed that some haplotypes of these species are shared between Continental Europe, the UK, and Ireland, suggesting a possible incursion pathway for this vector.

ConclusionDNA barcoding employing a combination of two barcodes, CO1 and ITS, proved effective in identifying Culicoides, especially species within the obsoletus complex, which are difficult to morphologically distinguish. Our findings also suggest that investigation of the population genetic structure of Culicoides spp. could be used to model the potential introduction routes of midge-borne pathogens into the country.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Moreover, differences between systems are defined by a distance that is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality, enabling downstream analyses such as clustering and nearest-neighbor regression.

Using state-of-the-art knock-in zebrafish models and single-cell transcriptomics we reveal the differential expression patterns of the different her genes, of which her2, her6, and her9, were identified as specific molecular signatures for distinguishing different ductal cell types with unique morphology and spatial distribution.

By analyzing multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we identify numerous ductal markers which are functional proteins for ductal integrity, and most notably CRISPR mutagenesis demonstrates that her9 is essential for hepatocyte recovery. Using multiple transgenic and knock-in zebrafish lines and genetic fate mapping, we provide a detailed characterization of the ductal remodeling process under development and extreme loss of intra-hepatic duct, highlighting the remarkable ductal cell plasticity.

However, it has hitherto been difficult to uncouple the importance of these two advantages of dioecy.
C_LIO_LIHere, we estimate the selfing rate and fitness gain curves with and without inbreeding depression in wind-pollinated Mercurialis annua, based on variation in sex allocation among hermaphrodites that evolved from dioecy following the experimental removal of males. Because males had been removed, we could rule out any important contribution to disruptive selection due to advantages of sexual specialisation, allowing us to focus in inbreeding effects.
C_LIO_LIOur results confirm a tradeoff between male and female allocation in M. annua, as assumed in sex-allocation theory. The individual selfing rates increased with male allocation, greatly altering the female and male fitness gain curves under strong inbreeding depression.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important early in metastasis to enable cancer cells to detach from neighboring cells, become migratory, and escape the primary tumor. While different phases of metastasis expose cells to variable nutrient environments and demands, the metabolic requirements and plasticity of each step are uncertain. Here we show that EMT and primary tumor escape are stimulated by disrupted oxidative metabolism. Using Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) patient samples, we identified the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor NDUFA4L2 as upregulated in cells undergoing EMT. Deletion of NDUFA4L2 enhanced oxidative metabolism and prevented EMT and metastasis while NDUFA4L2 overexpression enhanced these processes. Mechanistically, NDUFA4L2 suppressed oxidative phosphorylation and caused citric acid cycle intermediates to accumulate, which modified chromatin accessibility of EMT-related loci to drive primary tumor escape. The effect of impaired mitochondrial metabolism to drive EMT appeared general, as renal cell carcinoma patient tumors driven by fumarate hydratase mutations with disrupted oxidative phosphorylation were highly metastatic and also had robust EMT. These findings highlight the importance of dynamic shifts in metabolism for cell migration and metastasis, with mitochondrial impairment driving early phases of this process. Understanding mitochondrial dynamics may have important implications in both basic and translational efforts to prevent cancer deaths.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

At the behavioral level, results showed more errors in avoidance behavior following sedentary stimuli than physical activity stimuli. At the brain level, avoidance behavior following sedentary stimuli was associated with more activation of the motor control network (dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex, primary and secondary motor cortices, somatosensory cortex).

In this study, we report that during implantation, endometrial LE cells undergo partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) specifically at the implantation sites. This pEMT in the LE is critical, as the in vivo knockdown of the EMT transcription factor Twist2 inhibits embryo implantation. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in the expression of the transcription factor HOXA10 in LE cells at the implantation sites. Interestingly, LE cells from HOXA10-hypomorphic mice and human endometrial epithelial cells (RL95-2) with HOXA10 knockdown (HOXA10KD) also undergo pEMT and acquire a migratory phenotype in vitro, suggesting that the loss of HOXA10 drives pEMT in the endometrial epithelium. Transcriptome analysis of HOXA10KD cells revealed a higher pEMT score and differential expression of genes associated with cell migration and TGF-{beta} signaling pathways. We also identified the genome-wide occupancy sites of HOXA10 in human endometrial epithelial cells, uncovering 1,246 genes whose promoters are occupied by HOXA10 and are dysregulated in HOXA10KD cells. Functionally, these HOXA10 target genes fall into two broad categories: those involved in epithelial functions and those associated with mesenchymal functions. Collectively, our findings suggest that HOXA10 directly regulates genes to maintain endometrial cells in an epithelial state. Its loss activates mesenchymal genes while maintaining or inducing a distinct subset of epithelial genes, resulting in a pEMT phenotype. In summary, our study establishes pEMT in the LE as a critical step and reveals that the loss of HOXA10 triggers this process, enabling embryo implantation.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Division of labour in synthetic microbial communities offers a promising approach to enhance metabolic efficiency and resilience in bioproduction. By distributing complex metabolic pathways across multiple subpopulations, the resource competition and metabolic burden imposed on an individual cell is reduced, potentially enabling more efficient production of target compounds. Violacein is a high-value pigment with anti-tumour properties that exemplifies such a challenge due to its complex bioproduction pathway, imposing a significant metabolic burden on host cells. In this study we investigated the benefits of division of labour for violacein production by splitting the violacein bioproduction pathway between two subpopulations of Escherichia coli based synthetic communities. We tested several pathway splitting strategies and reported that splitting the pathway into two subpopulations expressing VioABE and VioDC at a final composition of 60:40 yields a 2.5 fold increase in violacein production as compared to a monoculture. We demonstrated that the coculture outperforms the monoculture when both subpopulations exhibit similar metabolic burden levels, resulting in comparable growth rates, and when both subpopulations are present in sufficiently high proportions.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Our study provides the first transcriptomic evidence of the ability of Ostreobium to transfer fixed carbon to other members of the holobiont and the coral host. Additionally, we identified critical roles of diverse coral holobiont members in nutrient cycling and maintaining homeostasis through scavenging of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. This study provides novel molecular-level understanding of the functional roles played by diverse coral holobiont members in their respective compartments and underscores that corals harbour several distinct microbiomes with a wide array of functions.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

However, challenges such as drug resistance remain significant in clinical applications. During mitosis, mRNA translation is generally downregulated, while non-canonical translation of specific transcripts proceeds. Here, we demonstrate that mitotic cancer cells redistribute ribosomes toward the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) and the start of the coding sequence (CDS), enhancing the translation of thousands of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and upstream overlapping open reading frames (uoORFs). This mitotic induction of uORF/uoORF enriches the presentation of immunopeptides at the surface of cancer cells following treatment with mitotic inhibitors. Functional assays indicate the potential of such neoepitopes to provoke cancer-cell killing by T cells. Altogether, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting uORF/uoORF-derived neoepitopes in combination with mitotic inhibitors to enhance immune recognition and tumor cell elimination.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

This might directly impact myelinating oligodendrocytes as these are particularly vulnerable to metabolic insults. Importantly, oligodendroglial dysfunction and myelin alterations occur in most, if not all neurodegenerative diseases, and are associated with axonal pathology/loss. Thus, elucidating metabolic mechanisms required for oligodendroglial myelin maintenance and axonal support might be crucial to identify therapeutic targets to achieve neuroprotection. While monocarboxylates are important energy fuels for the CNS, their role in myelinating oligodendrocyte function remains unclear. Here we show that, just like neurons, myelinating oligodendrocytes express high affinity monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) both in mice and humans, which is downregulated in progressive MS. While deletion of MCT2 in mouse oligodendrocytes did not affect the survival of these cells, it resulted in downregulation of lipid synthesis-associated enzymes and failure of myelin maintenance. Moreover, axonal upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase A concomitant with axonal damage was observed but could be alleviated by ketogenic diet. We conclude that oligodendroglial MCT2 is required for myelin maintenance and axonal support, which becomes altered in progressive MS, but may be compensated for by specific metabolic therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that PHEV, unlike other embecoviruses, samples open and closed conformations of its spike trimer at steady state. We found that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the PHEV spike shares no detectable sequence homology or receptor usage with those of closely related viruses. In contrast, the X-ray structure of the RBD/DPEP1 complex showed that the elements involved in receptor binding are conserved across embecoviruses, revealing a striking versatility of the RBD to accommodate highly variable sequences that confer novel receptor specificities.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Whereas RNAPII is very processive during mRNA transcription, it terminates rapidly during synthesis of many ncRNAs, particularly those that arise opportunistically from accessible chromatin at gene promoters or enhancers. The divergent fates of mRNA versus ncRNA species raise many questions about how RNAPII and associated machineries discriminate functional from spurious transcription. The Restrictor complex, comprised of the RNA binding protein ZC3H4 and RNAPII-interacting protein WDR82, has been implicated in restraining the expression of ncRNAs. However, the determinants of Restrictor targeting and the mechanism of transcription suppression remain unclear. Here, we investigate Restrictor using unbiased sequence screens, and rapid protein degradation followed by nascent RNA sequencing. We find that Restrictor promiscuously suppresses early elongation by RNAPII, but this activity is blocked at most mRNAs by the presence of a 5 splice site. Consequently, Restrictor is a critical determinant of transcription directionality at divergent promoters and prevents transcriptional interference. Finally, our data indicate that rather than directly terminating RNAPII, Restrictor acts by reducing the rate of transcription elongation, rendering RNAPII susceptible to early termination by other machineries.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

A central strategy for genetic adaptation is epigenetic phase variation (ePV) mediated by bacterial DNA methylation, which can regulate gene expression, enhance clonal heterogeneity, and enable a single bacterial strain to exhibit variable phenotypic states. Genome-wide and site-specific ePV have been well characterized in human pathogens' antigenic variation and virulence factor production. However, the role of ePV in facilitating adaptation within the human microbiome remains poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively cataloged genome-wide and site-specific ePV in human infant and adult gut microbiomes. First, using long-read metagenomic sequencing, we detected genome-wide ePV mediated by complex structural variations of DNA methyltransferases, highlighting the ones associated with antibiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation. Second, we analyzed an extensive collection of public short-read metagenomic sequencing datasets, uncovering a greater prevalence of genome-wide ePV in the human gut microbiome. Third, we quantitatively detected site-specific ePVs using single-molecule methylation analysis to identify dynamic variations associated with antibiotic treatment or probiotic engraftment. Finally, we performed an in-depth assessment of an Akkermansia muciniphila isolate from an infant, highlighting that ePV can regulate gene expression and enhance the bacterial adaptive capacity by employing a bet-hedging strategy to increase tolerance to differing antibiotics. Our findings indicate that epigenetic modifications are a common and broad strategy used by bacteria in the human gut to adapt to their environment.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

We infer that dispersal limitation and alternative selective histories shape current species distributions, and that anthropogenic change has and will continue to have different impacts on the two endemic species--closely associated with their different geographic and environmental distributions.

This includes loss of cell volume whilst maintaining membrane integrity to allow the expansion of the underlying LR primordia (LRPs). These accommodation responses are regulated by auxin-mediated signaling, specifically through Aux/IAA proteins, involving IAA3/SHY2. Plants that express a stabilized version of SHY2, shy2-2, in differentiated endodermal cells, CASP1pro::shy2-2 plants, fail to make LRs. Exogenous treatment with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) was reported to partially restore LR formation in this spatial accommodation mutant. Using treatments with auxins with different transport properties, such as NAA, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), we assessed the ability of each auxin to rescue LR formation in CASP1pro::shy2-2 roots. This revealed that IAA is the most effective in partially restoring LR development, NAA is effective in inducing LRPs but cannot maintain their canonical phenotype, whereas 2,4-D induces non-controlled cell divisions. In addition, we show that in CASP1pro::shy2-2 roots, AUX1 appears to be repressed in the zone where oscillation of the auxin response have been described. Our study advances the understanding of auxin-regulated spatial accommodation mechanisms during LRP formation and highlights the complex interplay of auxin transport and signaling in bypassing the endodermal constraints.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

In many mammals recombination hotspots have a rapid turnover, leading to episodic gBGC, with the accumulation of deleterious mutations stopping when the recombination hotspot dies. Selection is therefore expected to act to repair the damage caused by gBGC episodes through compensatory evolution. However, this process has never been studied or quantified so far. Here, we analysed the nucleotide substitution pattern in coding sequences of a highly diversified group of Murinae rodents. Using phylogenetic analyses of about 70,000 coding exons, we identified numerous exon-specific, lineage-specific gBGC episodes, characterised by a clustering of synonymous AT to GC substitutions and by an increasing rate of non-synonymous AT to GC substitutions, many of which are potentially deleterious. Analysing the molecular evolution of the affected exons in downstream lineages, we found evidence for pervasive compensatory evolution after deleterious gBGC episodes. Compensation appears to occur rapidly after the end of the episode, and to be driven by the standing genetic variation rather than new mutations. Our results demonstrate the impact of gBGC on the evolution of amino-acid sequences, and underline the key role of epistasis in protein adaptation. This study contributes to a growing body of literature emphasizing that adaptive mutations, which arise in response to environmental changes, are just one subset of beneficial mutations, alongside mutations resulting from oscillations around the fitness optimum.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Illumina presented higher genome completeness, while ONT identified a broader pangenome. Hybrid assembly outperformed both Illumina and ONT at identifying key AMR genetic determinants, presented results closer to Illumina's completeness, and revealed ONT-like pangenomic content.

Differences were also observed for specific gene classes and bacterial species, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of technology limitations.

Here we demonstrate that the UFMylation system, a post-translational modification system that catalyzes the transfer of UFM1 onto proteins, promotes infection by multiple orthoflaviviruses including dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus. We found that depletion of the UFMylation E3 ligase complex proteins UFL1 and UFBP1, as well as other UFMylation machinery components (UBA5, UFC1, and UFM1), significantly reduces infectious virion production for orthoflaviviruses but not the hepacivirus, hepatitis C. Mechanistically, UFMylation does not regulate viral RNA translation or RNA replication but instead affects a later stage of the viral lifecycle. We identified novel interactions between UFL1, and several viral proteins involved in orthoflavivirus virion assembly, including NS2A, NS2B-NS3, and Capsid. These findings establish UFMylation as a previously unrecognized post-translational modification system that promotes orthoflavivirus infection, likely through modulation of viral assembly. This work expands our understanding of the post-translational modifications that control orthoflavivirus infection and identifies new potential therapeutic targets.

ImportanceOrthoflaviviruses depend on host-mediated post-translational modifications to successfully complete their lifecycle, yet many of these critical interactions remain undefined. Here, we describe a role for a post-translational modification pathway, UFMylation, in promoting infectious particle production of ZIKV and DENV. We show that UFMylation regulates these viruses at a lifecycle stage after initial RNA translation and RNA replication. Additionally, we find that regulation of infection by UFMylation extends to other orthoflaviviruses, including West Nile virus and yellow fever virus, but not to the broader Flaviviridae family. Finally, we demonstrate that UFMylation machinery directly interacts with specific DENV and ZIKV proteins during infection.

Here, we demonstrate that a 2016 2.3.4.4e virus HA can convert to human-type receptor binding via a single Q226L mutation, in contrast to a cleavage-modified 2016 2.3.4.4b virus HA. Using glycan arrays, x-ray structural analyses, tissue- and direct glycan binding, we show that L133adelta and 227Q are vital for this phenotype. Thus, whereas the 2.3.4.4e virus HA only needs a single amino acid mutation, the modified 2.3.4.4b HA was not easily converted to human-type receptor specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

However, these two processes are largely studied separately. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and first-person movies of journeys through buildings and cities to determine the contribution of different brain regions to spatial and aesthetic aspects of the built environment. During scanning, participants watched 48 movies that show first-person-view travel through different spaces; immediately after each video, they either judged the spatial layout complexity or valence of the environment. After scanning, participants also reported the memorability of the spaces encountered. Activity in brain regions previously linked to valence processing (e.g. ventromedial prefrontal cortex) were modulated by aesthetic qualities of the stimuli (i.e. increased for pleasant spaces compared to unpleasant spaces) and the task (more active when judging valence), whereas activity in brain regions linked with spatial processing (e.g. parahippocampal regions) increased in complex layouts compared to simple layouts. The hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex were associated with the memorability of spaces and were modulated by both aesthetic and spatial qualities. We also tested for curvature, fascination, coherence and hominess - qualities linked to aesthetic judgement in architecture. We replicated findings activating right lingual gyrus for fascination, left inferior occipital gyrus for coherence, and left cuneus for hominess, and found inverse curvature (increasing rectilinearity) activated spatial, valence and visual processing regions. Overall, these findings provide important insights into how different brain regions respond whilst experiencing new buildings and city spaces, which is needed to advance the field of neuroarchitecture.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

Yet, only a handful of CRISPR-Cas9 based allele editing tools have been optimized to study this unique pathogen. In this work, we compare four systems to introduce the genetic elements necessary for the production of Cas9 and the guide RNA molecule in the genome of C. auris, replacing the ENO1, LEU2 and HIS1 loci respectively, while the fourth system makes use of an episomal plasmid. We observed that the editing efficiency of all four systems was significantly different and strain dependent. Alarmingly, we did not detect correct integration of linear CRISPR cassette constructs in integration-based systems, in over 4,900 screened transformants. Still, all transformants, whether correctly edited or not, grew on selective nourseothricin media, suggesting common random ectopic integration of the CRISPR cassette. Although the plasmid-based system showed a low transformation success compared to the other systems, it has the highest editing efficiency with 41.9% correct transformants on average. In an attempt to improve editing efficiencies of integration-based systems by silencing the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway, we deleted two main NHEJ factors, KU70 and LIG4. However, no improved editing or targeting efficiencies were detected in ku70D, lig4D, or ku70D/lig4D backgrounds. Our research highlights important challenges in precise genome editing of C. auris and sheds light on the advantages and limitations of several methods with the aim to guide scientists in selecting the most appropriate tool for molecular work in this enigmatic fungal pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664847

By integrating taxonomic, genomic and predicted functional annotations, we uncover how Bifidobacterium adapts to host-specific environments, shaped by vertical transmission, dietary influences, and host phylogeny. Our findings reveal that host phylogeny is a major determinant of gut microbiota composition. Distinct microbial networks in mammalian and avian hosts reflect evolutionary adaptations to dietary niches, such as carnivory, and ecological pressures. At a strain-resolved level, we identify strong co-phylogenetic associations between Bifidobacterium strains and their hosts, driven by vertical transmission and dietary selection, underscoring the intricate co-evolutionary dynamics between these microbes and their hosts. Functional analyses highlight striking host-specific metabolic adaptations in Bifidobacterium, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress responses. In mammals, we observe an enrichment of glycoside hydrolases (GH) tailored to complex carbohydrate-rich diets, including multi-domain GH13_28 -amylases featuring diverse carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM25, CBM26, and the novel CBM74). These adaptations emphasise the ecological flexibility of Bifidobacterium in breaking down alpha-linked glucose polysaccharides, such as resistant starch.

Avian influenza A viruses of the H5 subtype circulate globally among birds and are classified into distinct clades based on their hemagglutinin (HA) genetic sequences. Thus, the ability to accurately and rapidly assign clades to newly sequenced isolates is key to surveillance and outbreak response. Co-circulation of endemic, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5) lineages in North American and European wild birds necessitates the ability to rapidly and accurately distinguish between infections arising from these lineages and epizootic HPAI A(H5) viruses. However, currently available clade assignment tools are limited and often require command line expertise, hindering their utility for public health surveillance labs. To address this gap, we have developed datasets to enable A(H5) clade assignments with Nextclade, a drag-and-drop tool originally developed for SARS-CoV-2 genetic clade classification. Using annotated reference datasets for all historical A(H5) clades, clade 2.3.2.1 descendants, and clade 2.3.4.4 descendants provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/World Organisation for Animal Health (FAO/WHO/WOAH) H5 Working Group, we identified clade-defining mutations for every established clade to enable tree-based clade assignment. We then created three Nextclade datasets which can be used to assign clades to A(H5) HA sequences and call mutations relative to reference strains through a drag-and-drop interface. Nextclade assignments were benchmarked with 19,834 unique sequences not in the reference set using a pre-released version of LABEL, a well-validated and widely used command line software. Prospective assignment of new sequences with Nextclade and LABEL produced very well-matched assignments (match rates of 97.8% and 99.1% for the 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.4 datasets, respectively). The all-clades dataset also performed well (94.8% match rate) and correctly distinguished between all HPAI and LPAI strains. This tool additionally allows for the identification of polybasic cleavage site sequences and potential N-linked glycosylation sites. These datasets therefore provide an alternative, rapid method to accurately assign clades to new A(H5) HA sequences, with the benefit of an easy-to-use browser interface.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664848

Changes in gene expression play a critical role in the cellular response to hypoxia, enabling cells to adapt to reduced oxygen availability by regulating metabolism, angiogenesis, and survival pathways. These changes are primarily mediated by the HIF family of transcription factors, however other transcription factors such as NF-{kappa}B, are also activated in the hypoxic response. Although NF-{kappa}B is known to be activated under hypoxic conditions the extent of NF-{kappa}B contributions to the hypoxic response remains poorly understood. In this study we analyse hypoxia-induced NF-{kappa}B dependent gene expression, to define the NF-{kappa}B-dependent hypoxic signature. Our analysis reveals that a significant proportion of hypoxia-induced gene expression changes are NF-{kappa}B dependent, with majority of the hypoxia downregulated genes requiring NF-{kappa}B for their repression. We show that, while the NF-{kappa}B-mediated hypoxic response may vary between cell types, there are a core subset of hypoxia inducible genes that require NF-{kappa}B across multiple cell backgrounds. We demonstrate that NF-{kappa}B is critical for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation under hypoxic conditions. This work highlights that NF-{kappa}B has a central role in hypoxia response, regulating a broader set of genes than previously thought, providing new understanding into the gene expression regulation by hypoxia and NF-{kappa}B.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664848

One of the hallmarks of ageing is stem cell exhaustion which occurs due to dynamic changes in the stem cell - niche microenvironment. Ageing affects stem cell potency impacting self-renewal and differentiation trajectories. Blood cell homeostasis in the hematopoietic system is tightly regulated by a fine balance between stemness and differentiation. Here, we employ the Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the larval lymph gland (LG) to investigate the impact of modulating cellular ageing on organ homeostasis. LG consists of a Posterior Signalling Center (PSC) that acts as a stem cell niche and maintains the prohemocytes housed in the Medullary Zone (MZ). Cortical Zone (CZ) consists of differentiated hemocytes namely plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes. Intricate signalling networks active in the PSC and MZ orchestrate and regulate homeostasis. In this study, we characterize the effect of genetic perturbation of the molecular circuitry of ageing locally and systemically to investigate its effect on LG blood cell homeostasis. Genetic modulation of cellular ageing displays traditional hallmarks of ageing validating our model in the LG. Our results indicate that induction of accelerated ageing both locally and systemically leads to a reduction in stem cell niche size, DNA damage accumulation and increased progenitor differentiation whereas decelerated ageing shows an opposite trend. We show that the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway is activated upon inducing accelerated ageing in the LG hemocytes possibly to recoup back to homeostatic conditions. Furthermore, LGs of ISR pathway mutants or upon perturbation of ISR pathway components in prohemocytes show increased blood cell differentiation indicating disruption of homeostasis. Genetic epistasis analysis shows that ectopic over-expression of ISR pathway genes in an accelerated ageing scenario over and above the existing levels can rescue the defects in blood cell homeostasis. Overall, our study explores how modulation of cellular aging locally or systemically can impact tissue homeostasis. Our research paves way to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying an aged versus young stem cell-niche microenvironment and how its abrogation may lead to onset of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664848

To address this, we tagged engram cells in the auditory cortex during tone fear conditioning and compared their dendritic and somatic properties with neighbouring non-engram cells. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that tuft dendrites of engram cells had dampened, but synchronous, activity during recall. Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings illustrated that engram cells were preferentially connected with neighbouring engram cells and had decreased excitability due to a transient increase in Ih current.

This niche diversity is mediated by bacterial effectors injected via the two type 3 secretion systems (T3SS). Salmonella resides either within membrane-bound Salmonella containing vacuoles (SCV) or they grow rapidly within the cytosol upon SCV rupture. Recently, we identified a third intracellular subpopulation, dormant Salmonella within modified vacuoles in epithelial cells, which can survive for up to 7 days in vitro. To explore how bacterial effectors influence the balance of these three subpopulations, we constructed a panel of mutants lacking genes encoding key effectors and examined their intracellular behaviors at 6 and 24 hours post-infection (hpi). Deletion of the T3SS-2 effector SifA significantly increased the dormant subpopulation at later infection time points, identifying SifA as the first known effector regulating bacterial dormancy in epithelial cells. SifA-induced Salmonella-induced filaments (SIFs) characterize the mature Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), and we observed that SIFs were needed for intravacuolar growth of Salmonella. We could show that SIF formation was critical for nutrient acquisition within the SCV; inhibition of SIF formation resulted in a higher proportion of dormant bacteria, akin to the effect of reduced glucose availability during infection. Both bacterial and host glycolysis pathways were required to prevent dormancy, as proper nutrient scavenging through SIF-mediated modification of the SCV is essential for maintaining a replicative, non-dormant state. These results underscore the importance of nutrient access, facilitated by reprogramming host endomembrane trafficking, for Salmonella to avoid dormancy and sustain active replication within its intracellular niche.

These cognitive impairments, however, are transient when they first appear and can fluctuate across disease progression. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying fluctuations of performance in amnestic mice. We trained APP/PS1+ mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated learning of task contingencies (knowledge) from its more variable expression under reinforcement (performance). APP/PS1+ exhibited significant performance deficits compared to control mice. Using large-scale two-photon imaging of 6,216 excitatory neurons in 8 mice, we found that auditory cortical networks were more suppressed, less selective to the sensory cues, and exhibited aberrant higher-order encoding of reward prediction compared to control mice. A small sub-population of neurons, however, displayed the opposite phenotype, reflecting a potential compensatory mechanism. Volumetric analysis demonstrated that deficits were concentrated near A{beta} plaques. Strikingly, we found that these cortical deficits were reversed almost instantaneously on probe (non-reinforced) trials when APP/PS1+ performed as well as control mice, providing neural evidence for intact stimulus-action knowledge despite variable ongoing performance. A biologically-plausible reinforcement learning model recapitulated these results and showed that synaptic weights from sensory-to-decision neurons were preserved (i.e. intact stimulus-action knowledge) despite poor performance that was due to inadequate contextual scaling (i.e. impaired performance). Our results suggest that the amnestic phenotype is transient, contextual, and endogenously reversible, with the underlying neural circuits retaining the underlying stimulus-action associations. Thus, memory deficits commonly observed in amnestic mouse models, and potentially at early stages of dementia in humans, relate more to contextual drivers of performance rather than degeneration of the underlying memory traces.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664848

However, systematic understanding remains limited due to the rarity, genetic heterogeneity, and complex genotype-phenotype relationships of these diseases. Primary ciliopathies are a diverse group of rare disorders caused by variants in genes associated with the cilium, a cellular organelle involved in signaling during development and cell homeostasis. These genetic variants result in a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes involving the brain, eye, kidney and skeleton. It remains unclear to what extent this phenotypic diversity can be attributed to the disease-causing genes and their specific roles in ciliary function. Here, we systematically compared human primary ciliopathies with each other and with mouse phenotypes by propagating known disease genes through a network of protein interactions. Network propagation improved the clustering of primary ciliopathies with shared clinical phenotypes and facilitated the identification of mouse phenotypes closely related to primary ciliopathies due to shared groups of proteins in the interaction network. By leveraging this phenotype-specific approach, we prioritized candidate genes for ciliopathies and identified likely pathogenic variants in CEP43, a novel candidate gene for human primary ciliopathies in three previously unsolved cases. This study demonstrates that network propagation enhances the genetic and phenotypic understanding of primary ciliopathies, aiding in the prioritization of candidate genes and identification of relevant mouse models for these rare disorders, and providing a framework for unraveling shared underlying mechanisms for other rare genetic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1736719664848

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1736719664848

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736719664848
