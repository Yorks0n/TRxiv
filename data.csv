During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1751494166120

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1751494166120

We found that NRC4 membrane enrichment coincided with calcium influx. This is followed by sequential mitochondria and plastid disruption, endoplasmic reticulum fragmentation and cytoskeleton depolymerization. Subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear shrinkage, and vacuolar collapse mark the terminal stage of cell death. Our findings reveal a spatiotemporally resolved cascade of subcellular events downstream of resistosome activation, providing new mechanistic insight into the execution phase of plant immune cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

One of the most promising applications of these FMs is perturbation response modeling. This task aims to forecast how cells will respond to drugs or genetic interventions. Accurate perturbation response models could drastically accelerate drug discovery by reducing the space of interventions that need to be tested in the wet lab. However, recent studies have shown that FM-based models often struggle to outperform simpler baselines for perturbation response prediction. A key obstacle is the lack of understanding of the components driving performance in FM-based perturbation response models. In this work, we conduct the first systematic pan-modal study of perturbation embeddings, with an emphasis on those derived from biological FMs. We benchmark their predictive accuracy, analyze patterns in their predictions, and identify the most successful representation learning strategies. Our findings offer insights into what FMs are learning and provide practical guidance for improving perturbation response modeling.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the ""Porto do Son"" cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

The current focus on AI deployments in urban areas and the history of US urban-rural digital divides raises concerns that the promise of AI may not be realized in rural communities. This may exacerbate well-documented health disparities. Without the benefits of AI-driven improvements in patient outcomes and increased efficiency, rural healthcare facilities may fall farther behind their urban counterparts and rural hospital closure rates may continue to rise.

MethodsWe conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA guidelines. We included peer-reviewed, original research studies indexed in PubMed, Embase, and WebOfScience after January 1, 2010 and through April 29, 2025. Studies were required to discuss the development, implementation, or evaluation of AI tools in rural US healthcare, including frameworks that help facilitate AI development (e.g., data warehouses).

FindingsOur search strategy found 26 studies meeting inclusion criteria after full text screening with 14 papers discussing predictive AI models and 12 papers discussing data or research infrastructure. AI models most commonly targeted resource allocation and distribution. Few studies explored model deployment and impact. Half noted the lack of data and analytic resources as a limitation to both development and validation. None of the studies discussed examples of generative AI being trained, evaluated, or deployed in a rural setting.

InterpretationPractical limitations may be influencing and limiting the types of AI models evaluated in the rural US. We noted validation of tools in the rural US was underwhelming, and ultimately, neglected. With few studies moving beyond AI model design and development stages, there is a clear gap in our understanding of how to reliably validate, deploy, and sustain AI models in rural settings to advance health in all communities.

FundingNational Library of Medicine

Research in contextEvidence before this study: Clinical artificial intelligence (AI)--both for prediction modeling and generative tools-- tools promise to reduce care delays, improve diagnosis and treatment decision-making, reduce care costs, and improve efficiency to reduce provider workload and enhance practice management. Unfortunately, efforts to deploy artificial intelligence (AI)--both for prediction modeling and generative tools--in healthcare are advancing, primarily at large academic medical centers and in urban areas. An emerging new digital divide in the use of clinical AI could exacerbate the well-documented health disparities between urban and rural communities in the United States. A better understanding of if and how AI is being developed, deployed, and evaluated across rural US communities is necessary to identify resources gaps and challenges to broad AI use in all communities.

Added value of this study: This study analyzes the current state of artificial intelligence research in the rural United States. For predictive AI models, applications most commonly targeted resource allocation and distribution. We noted several attempts to predict resource utilization of patients who were either tested or tested positive to COVID-19. However, we noted few AI solutions for acute medical events faced by rural patients, such as trauma and stroke, despite worse outcomes for rural patients suffering from these acute events. The limited availability of time-critical specialties such as trauma/emergency medicine, neurology, and cardiology in rural areas often necessitates patients with such conditions be transferred to larger, more resourced hospitals. Practical limitations may be influencing and limiting the types of AI models evaluated in rural US medical facilities. The most frequent model employed were tree-based ensembles, such as random forests and gradient-boosting trees. Our review also highlighted few studies of AI models moving beyond the design and develop stages, leaving a clear gap in our understanding of how to deploy and sustain predictive AI models in rural settings. Several challenges noted in the reviewed studies may provide insight into this lack of translation from research to implementation. We note that validation of A tools in the rural US was underwhelming, and ultimately, neglected. The most common form of model validation employed was a single random holdout test set. Half of the included papers mentioned a lack of reliable data sources or limited data volume as a potential challenge in developing and adopting AI/ML tools. The use of patient-level EHR data was often limited to what was available to the authors or at a specific medical center.

Implications of all the available evidence: Our review indicates a gap and highlights opportunity for innovation in leveraging AI tools to predict and support patients in rural communities. Further research is needed to enhance the translation of state-of-the-art modeling techniques into effective AI tools for use in the rural US, including exploring partnerships between academic medical centers and rural communities and solutions to logistic challenges of such partnerships, including data and resource sharing.","NA","medrxiv",1751494166120

An important mechanism of miRNA regulation is target-directed microRNA degradation (TDMD), a pathway in which the binding of miRNAs to specialized trigger RNAs induces ubiquitylation and decay of associated Argonaute (AGO) proteins by the ZSWIM8 ubiquitin ligase. Concomitant release of miRNAs results in their rapid turnover. ZSWIM8-deficient mice exhibit reduced body size, cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental defects, and perinatal lethality. Despite widespread dysregulation of miRNAs in these animals, the vast majority of presumptive trigger RNAs that induce decay of ZSWIM8-regulated miRNAs remain undefined. Here, using AGO crosslinking and sequencing of hybrids (AGO-CLASH), a high-throughput method for identifying miRNA binding sites, we report the identification of Plagl1 as a TDMD trigger for miR-322-5p, and Lrrc58 and Malat1 as TDMD triggers for miR-503-5p in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In mice, deletion of the miR-322-5p and miR-503-5p trigger sites in the Plagl1 and Lrrc58 3' UTRs, respectively, abrogated TDMD of these miRNAs and resulted in miR-322/503-dependent embryonic growth restriction, recapitulating a key feature of the Zswim8-/- phenotype. Thus, Plagl1 and Lrrc58 act as triggers for degradation of miR-322-5p and miR-503-5p, revealing a noncoding function for these mRNAs as regulators of mammalian body size.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

In early 2024, H5N1 HPAIV was detected in dairy cattle in the United States of America, where it has continued to circulate, with sporadic detections also reported in other ruminant species. The detection of high viral loads in milk from infected cattle, has resulted in several human infections, underscoring the zoonotic potential of these viruses. In response, several countries have intensified surveillance in non-avian species to evaluate the potential for undetected viral circulation in captive mammals. In Great Britain, bulk milk tank testing of cattle and targeted surveillance of captive mammalian species on an infected premises is undertaken in accordance with the outcome of a rapid risk assessment undertaken to determine the epidemiological links between the poultry and captive mammals. A result of this testing was the first recorded detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV in a sheep in March 2025, identified on an infected poultry premises in Great Britain. An initial seropositive result in a single ewe triggered further investigation, confirming serological positivity across repeated sampling and the presence of viral RNA in milk samples. This detection was confined to a single animal and was likely attributable to proximity to infected poultry and a presumed heavily contaminated environment. The implications of this ruminant detection are discussed in the context of interspecies transmission and surveillance strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States.

Despite numerous studies, an existing knowledge lacuna in the role of AP-3 in DCV function prompted us to delve deeper. Advanced microscopy and biochemical analysis revealed compromised DCV exocytosis in AP-3-depleted PC12 cells and C. elegans. AP-3 depletion altered the size and positioning of DCVs. Golgi defects and RUSH (Retention under Selective Hook) substantiated the role of AP-3 in trans-Golgi DCV budding. Proteomics revealed the loss of specific known and putative novel DCV proteins, which were mislocalized and rerouted to lysosomes in AP-3-depleted cells. Bioinformatics, Proximity ligation assays and Co-immunoprecipitation identified interactions of mislocalized proteins with AP-3 subunit. These findings corroborated with functional defects in granule maturation, release modes, Zinc and neurotransmitter mobilisation. Our study highlights the complexity of the AP-3 complex in regulating DCV function and its importance in vesicle transport in neurons and neuroendocrine cells.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

A vaccine administered to pregnant women, protecting against [&ge;]70% of K. pneumoniae infections, could avert [~]400,000 cases and [~]80,000 deaths annually, mostly in Africa and South Asia. Vaccine formulations targeting the capsular polysaccharide (K) or lipopolysaccharide (O) antigens are in development. Global K. pneumoniae populations display extensive K and O diversity, necessitating a polyvalent vaccine targeted to the serotypes associated with neonatal disease in relevant geographical regions. We investigated the prevalence of K and O types associated with neonatal sepsis in Africa and South Asia to inform maternal vaccine design.

Methods and FindingsWe analysed n=1930 K. pneumoniae neonate blood isolates from 13 surveillance studies across 35 sites in 13 countries. We used pathogen sequencing to predict K and O serotypes and correct for local transmission clusters, and Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis to estimate K and O prevalence. Eighty-seven K loci were identified. KL2, KL102, KL25, KL15 and KL62 accounted for 49% of isolates. We estimate that 20 K loci, combining the eight most prevalent per region, could cover 72.9% of all infections [95% credible interval, 69.4-76.5%] and [&ge;]70% in each of Eastern, Western and Southern Africa and South Asia. Preliminary findings from three sites suggested sufficient temporal stability of K loci to maintain 20-valent K vaccine coverage over 5-10 years, but more longitudinal data are needed to support this prediction. O types were far less diverse (n=14 types). We estimate the top-5 (O1{beta},2, O1{beta},2{beta}, O2, O2{beta} and O4) would cover 86% [82.6-89.9%] of total infections (76-92% per region), while the top-10 would cover [~]99% of infections in all four regions.

ConclusionsNeonatal sepsis is associated with diverse K and O types, with substantial geographic and temporal variation even after adjusting for localised transmission clusters. Despite this, a single 20-valent K vaccine could theoretically cover [&ge;]70% of infections in all target regions. Locally-targeted vaccines could achieve higher coverage with lower valency, but are less feasible. In principle, very high coverage could be achieved with lower valency O-based vaccines, however protective efficacy of antibodies targeting the O antigen remains uncertain. Further research is needed on cross-reactivity, antigen exposure and stability of antigens over time, to better inform vaccine development.","NA","medrxiv",1751494166120

Demographic differences in aging generated by sex have long been recognized, but the underlying biological basis for these differences and the potential for sex-specific interventions remain understudied. To explore sex differences in the response to pro-longevity interventions, we utilized the C. elegans aging model and asked whether male lifespan and reproductive healthspan can be extended via compounds known to have pro-longevity effects in hermaphrodites. We tested seven different compounds at two concentrations each and found that lifespan was extended under all tested conditions. However, reproductive healthspan measured by mating success in late life improved under only two tested conditions, sulforaphane and metformin. These results demonstrate that lifespan and healthspan can be decoupled in C. elegans males and offer a new framework for screening pro-longevity compounds and for studying sex differences in aging in a classical aging model.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

We developed two novel functional assessments of short-term spatial memory that were administered by community science participants in a sample of 6,753 dogs through the Dog Aging Project. We compared data generated by community scientists to those gathered by research professionals, estimated relationships between age and task performance, and tested the hypothesis that associations between age and cognitive performance vary by dog body mass, as a proxy for expected lifespan. Community scientists generated similar data to research professionals and both cognitive tasks were sensitive to age-related deficits, beginning in midlife. Relationships between age and cognitive function were highly similar across small and large dogs and, for both tasks, comparison of models with and without an interaction between age and body mass yielded decisive evidence for the model without the interaction. Large dogs exhibit accelerated aging across many traits, and so the lack of evidence for accelerated cognitive aging raises the possibility that their large size confers a neuroprotective advantage. We consider possible mechanisms underlying this effect and address how experimental studies of dog cognition using community science methods can support future research on mechanisms of brain and cognitive aging.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

Flowering shoot (inflorescence) architecture varies significantly across plant families and is a key target of genetic engineering efforts in many crops. Asteraceae (sunflower family), comprising 10% of flowering plants, all have capitula, a novel inflorescence that mimics a single flower. Asteraceae capitula are highly diverse but are thought to have evolved once via unknown mechanisms. During capitulum development, shoot stem cells undergo prolonged proliferation to accommodate the formation of intersecting spirals of flowers (florets) along the disk-shaped head9,10. Here we show that capitulum evolution paralleled decreases in CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signaling, a conserved repressor of stem cell proliferation. We trace this to novel amino acid changes in the mature CLV3 peptide which decrease receptor binding and downstream transcriptional outputs. Using genetically tractable Asteraceae models, we show that reversion of CLV3 to a more active form impairs Asteraceae stem cell regulation and capitulum development. Additionally, we trace the evolution of CLV3 and its receptors across the Asterales allowing inferences on capitulum evolution within this lineage. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms driving evolutionary innovation in plant reproduction and suggest new approaches for genetic engineering in crop species.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

This study developed microbially competent 3D skin organotypics (OTs) representing healthy (5M) and dandruff (5MP) microbiomes, to investigate host-microbial interactions. OTs colonised with 5M microbiota exhibited healthy skin morphology, while 5MP colonised OTs displayed dandruff-like phenotypes, including altered epidermal morphology, reduced barrier protein expression, and dysregulated corneodesmosome hydrolysis. Transcriptomic and protein analysis revealed attenuation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signalling pathway in 5MP colonised OTs, a finding subsequently validated at the protein level in participants with dandruff. These results strongly suggest that microbial dysbiosis contributes to dandruff pathogenesis through disruption of AhR signalling, a pathway crucial for maintaining epidermal barrier function and immune homeostasis. This in vitro model provides new insights into the role of microbial dysbiosis in skin disorders and could open new avenues for host-microbiome therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

Given that DNA serves as the foundational blueprint within the central dogma, the ultimate evaluation of a gLM is its ability to generalize across this entire biological cascade. However, existing evaluations lack this holistic and consistent framework, leaving researchers uncertain about which model best translates sequence understanding into downstream biological prediction. Here we present Genomic Touchstone, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate gLMs across 36 diverse tasks and 88 datasets structured along the central dogma's modalities of DNA, RNA, and protein, encompassing 5.34 billion base pairs of genomic sequences. We evaluate 34 representative models encompassing transformers and convolutional neural networks, as well as emerging efficient architectures such as Hyena and Mamba. Our analysis yield four key insights. First, gLMs achieve comparable or superior performance on RNA and protein tasks compared to models pretrained on these molecules. Second, transformer-based models continue to lead in overall performance, yet efficient sequence models show promising task-specific capabilities and deserve further exploration. Third, the scaling behavior of gLMs remains incompletely understood. While longer input sequences and more diverse pretraining data consistently improve performance, increases in model size do not always translate into better results. Fourth, pretraining strategies, including the choice of training objectives and the composition of pretraining corpora, exert substantial influence on downstream generalization across different genomic contexts. Genomic Touchstone establishes a unified evaluation framework tailored to human genomics. By spanning multiple molecular modalities and biological tasks, it offers a valuable foundation for guiding future gLM design and understanding model generalizability in complex biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

While several SRT analysis frameworks have been developed, the vast majority of them focus on analyzing individual samples, and do not allow for comparisons of spatial gene expression patterns across experimental conditions, such as healthy vs. diseased states. Here, we present a novel approach to identify differential spatial patterns (DSP), i.e., genes that exhibit changes in spatial expression patterns between groups of samples across conditions. Our framework processes diverse SRT data types and detects DSP by performing differential gene expression testing across conditions. Notably, this comparison is not currently available in any other spatial omics method. In addition to detecting DSP across conditions, our framework includes two key features. First, it can identify tissue regions where expression changes across conditions. Second, it can detect spatial gene expression pattern changes across more than two experimental conditions, with flexible models. With ad hoc simulations, we demonstrate that our approach has good true positive rates and well-calibrated false discovery rates. Applied to experimental data, our method identifies biologically relevant DSP genes while maintaining computational efficiency.

Here, we assessed the impact of MS risk allele HLA-B7 and protective allele HLA-A2 on the effector phenotype of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells and if this corresponds with anti-EBV IgG titers. For this, we selected HLA-A2+ and/or HLA-B7+ donors with and without MS and analyzed HLA-restricted, EBV-specific CD8+ T cells with different fine-specificities using 38 color-based spectral flow cytometry. In contrast to HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells, HLA-B7-restricted CD8+ T cells showed a confined response to EBV, which was mainly directed against latent peptide EBNA3A(379-387). These HLA-B7-restricted EBV-specific CD8+ T cells expressed higher levels of CNS residency markers CXCR3 and CD20 and were most abundant in fresh single-cell suspensions derived from different post-mortem CNS compartments of an HLA-A2+B7+ MS donor. Moreover, HLA-B7-restricted EBV-specific CD8+ T cells displayed a more exhausted phenotype (PD-1+CD244+CD160+KLRG1+TIGIT+) that stood out in the blood from people with MS (pwMS). Accordingly, in the blood, increased IgG titers against EBV were found for pwMS carrying HLA-B7 but lacking HLA-A2, which seemed to coincide with HLA-B7-restricted EBV-specific CD8+ T cells having such an effector phenotype. These data support a model in which the confined response against EBV makes circulating HLA-B7-restricted CD8+ T cells less able to control EBV and more prone to infiltrate the CNS in pwMS.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

Single-molecule footprinting (SMF) methods that rely on the labeling of individual accessible DNA bases have emerged in recent years as a powerful chromatin accessibility mapping approach, as they provide not just an average readout of accessibility over a given genomic position but also the distribution of accessibility states within a population at the level of individual original DNA molecules. However, SMF approaches have been limited either in their resolution or in labeling readout accuracy. To address these limitations, we have developed a high-resolution strand-specific single molecule footprinting approach (C[-&gt;]U/T-ssSMF) based on the application of highly active sequence context-independent endogenous methylation-insensitive double-strand DNA (dsDNA) deaminases (CseDa01 and LbDa02), which convert accessible cytosines into uracils (and in turn into thymine after amplification). We demonstrate the application of the method to mapping fine-grained single-molecule accessibility states in human cell lines in both a short and a long-read format, and quantifying the occupancy states of individual transcription factors (TFs) as well as TF co-accessibility and strand-specific accessibility patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

To uncover key downstream targets of this fusion involved in cell differentiation, we combined transcriptomic profiling of EwS cell lines following EWSR1::FLI1 inhibition with gene ontology analysis, a clinically annotated gene expression dataset derived from EwS patient material and network analyses. This integrative approach identified inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1, alias BIRC2) as an EWSR1::FLI1-suppresed gene. Despite its known oncogenic role in many cancers, cIAP1 showed minimal expression in EwS. Using inducible cIAP1 re-expression models in EwS cells, we demonstrated that cIAP1 re-expression suppresses proliferation, clonogenic growth, and 3D spheroid formation in vitro. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that low cIAP1 expression enhances proliferation-related gene signatures, which are inhibited upon cIAP1 re-expression. In vivo xenograft models revealed that cIAP1 re-expression significantly reduces tumor growth, mitotic activity, and Ki-67 positivity, while increasing tumor necrosis and apoptosis. These findings highlight an unexpected tumor-suppressive role for cIAP1 in fusion-driven sarcomas, contrasting with its pro-survival function in other cancers. Collectively, our results identify cIAP1 as a prognostically relevant, EWSR1::FLI1-regulated hub whose re-expression disrupts tumor progression, offering a potential therapeutic strategy to restore tumor-suppressive pathways in EwS.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

However, the effects of acute stressors on the gut microbiota, and how these interact with host stress responses, are less well understood. Here, we show that acute exposure of wild-derived mice (Mus musculus domesticus) to predator odor altered the composition of the gut microbiota, which in turn predicted host behavior. We experimentally tested the individual and combined effects of brief (15-minute) exposure to synthetic fox fecal odor and prolonged (4-week) social isolation, a well-established chronic stress paradigm. Leveraging behavioral assays, transcriptomics of visceral adipose tissue, and analyses of 3,500 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) generated from our data, we found significant effects of predator odor on host behavior, gene expression, and gut microbiota. Gut microbial communities and host gene expression profiles responded more strongly to brief predator-odor exposure than to prolonged social isolation. The relative abundances of predator odor-responsive bacterial species, including members of the Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae, measured a week after a single predator-odor exposure were associated with host phenotypes assessed the following week, namely grooming and social behaviors and the expression of genes involved in anti-microbial defense, even after accounting for the effects of the stressors. Using random forest classifiers, we found that variation in gut-microbiota composition significantly predicted variation in behavior within treatment groups. These results indicate interactions between the gut microbiota and the responses of wild-derived mice to the threat of predation, and ecologically relevant acute stressor.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

MethodsSEEG data from 86 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy implanted at the UK National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery were analysed (6,372 electrode contacts). Normative structural and functional connectomes were combined with meta-analytic functional maps to estimate the probability of each contact engaging networks associated with psychiatric symptoms. A linear model, developed using published data from 80 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treated with DBS, was used to validate the approach.

ResultsNetworks involved in reward processing emerged as the most promising DBS targets, with a predicted required sample size of 7 patients (range 4-33). Bipolar disorder was the next most feasible (22 patients; range 10-44), followed by depression (32; range 16-49) and anxiety (38; range 17-59). For other disorders, estimated sample sizes exceeded 40, indicating limited feasibility for single-centre studies.

ConclusionsThis study provides preliminary support for using SEEG to map brain circuits underlying psychiatric symptoms.

While two consecutive APs result in fast trap closure in wildtype (WT) plants, sustained AP generation by the insect struggling to escape the trap leads to jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, formation of the digestive ""stomach"", and release of enzymes needed to decompose the victim. The Dionaea muscipula DYSCALCULIA (DYSC) mutant is able to fire touch-induced APs, but unlike WT plants, it does not snap-close its traps after two consecutive APs. Moreover, DYSC plants fail to properly initiate the JA pathway in response to mechanostimulation and even wounding, a well-known JA-dependent process conserved among plants. As demonstrated in previous studies, this DYSC mutant defect is associated with impaired decoding of mechanostimulation (i.e. touch) -induced Ca2+ signals. External JA application to the trap, however, restores slow trap closure and digestive gland function in DYSC, while rapid trap closure is JA-independent and cannot be rescued by exogenous JA application. Higher frequency mechanostimulation and thus more APs, however, revealed that DYSC is still able to close its traps, albeit much slower than WT plants. To reveal the molecular underpinnings of DYSCs delayed trap movement, we generated a chromosome-scale Dionaea genome assembly and profiled gene expression. The refined transcriptomic analysis uncovered widespread misregulation of cell wall-related genes in DYSC, implicating altered cell wall plasticity in the sluggish mutant. Cell indentation studies by atomic force microscopy revealed a strictly localized and strikingly enhanced stiffening of the cell wall for DYSC that may hinder rapid trap closure and snap buckling. Together, these genomic, transcriptomic, and biophysical data identify cell wall elasticity as a key constraint on voltage and Ca2+ dependent trap kinetics. This finding documents the interrelationship between mechanosensing and Ca2+ signaling in the ultrafast capture organ of the Venus flytrap.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166120

However, current tools often lack scalability, flexibility, and native support for multi-omics integration, posing significant barriers for exploring complex biological networks. To address these limitations, we developed MetaNet, a high-performance R package designed to construct, visualize, and analyze biological networks from multi-omics datasets. MetaNet supports highly efficient correlation-based network construction, scalable to datasets with over 10,000 features, and includes extensive layout algorithms and visualization options compatible with both static and interactive platforms. It also provides a comprehensive suite of topological and stability metrics for in-depth network characterization. Benchmarking results show that MetaNet outperforms existing R packages by up to 100-fold in computation time and reduces memory usage by up to 50-fold. We demonstrate its utility through two case studies: (1) a longitudinal analysis of microbial co-occurrence networks showing the dynamics of the airborne microbiome, and (2) an integrative exposome-transcriptome network of more than 40,000 features, uncovering distinct regulatory impacts of biological and chemical exposures. MetaNet bridges the gap between network theory and omics application by offering a robust, reproducible, and biologically informed framework for large-scale, interpretable, and integrative network analyses across diverse omics platforms, advancing systems-level understanding in modern life sciences.

Yet, the causes of this stepwise expansion remain poorly understood. Here, using mathematical modeling and stochastic simulations, we show that recombination suppression can expand simply due to the widespread presence of deleterious recessive mutations in genomes. We demonstrate that a significant proportion of new inversions are initially advantageous because they carry fewer mutations than average. However, these less-loaded inversions generally fail to fix on autosomes because, as their frequency increases, the recessive deleterious mutations they carry are more likely to occur in a homozygous state, leading to a selective disadvantage. In contrast, the permanent heterozygosity of Y-like sex chromosomes shelters sex-linked inversions from this disadvantage, facilitating their fixation and thereby the stepwise expansion of non-recombining regions. We show that this sheltering effect leads to fixation probabilities exceeding those expected under drift alone. Once recombination is suppressed, deleterious mutations accumulate on inversions, which could select for recombination restoration. However, we show that the accumulation of overlapping genomic rearrangements following recombination suppression can prevent its restoration. Our theoretical model proposes a simple and testable framework explaining evolutionary strata on sex and mating-type chromosomes, and other supergenes.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166121

Despite the importance of this relationship, how nodule-forming bacteria are affected by plant exudates and soil minerals is not fully characterized. Here, the effects of plant-derived methanol and lanthanide metals on the growth of nitrogen-fixing Rhizobiales are examined. Prior work has demonstrated that select Bradyrhizobium strains can assimilate methanol only in the presence of lanthanide metals; however, the pathway enabling assimilation remains unknown. In this study, we characterize Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110, Bradyrhizobium sp. USDA 3456, and Sinorhizobium meliloti 2011 to determine the pathways involved in methanol metabolism in previously characterized strains, other clades of Bradyrhizobium, and the more distantly related Sinorhizobium. Based on genomic analyses, we hypothesized that methanol assimilation in these organisms occurs via the lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase XoxF, followed by oxidation of formaldehyde via the glutathione-linked oxidation pathway, subsequent oxidation of formate via formate dehydrogenases, and finally assimilation of CO2 via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Transcriptomics revealed upregulation of the aforementioned pathways in Bradyrhizobium sp. USDA 3456 during growth on methanol. Enzymatic assays demonstrated increased activity of the glutathione-linked oxidation pathway and formate dehydrogenases in all strains during growth on methanol compared to succinate. 13C-labeling studies confirmed the presence of CBB intermediates and label incorporation during growth on methanol. Our findings provide multiple lines of evidence supporting the proposed XoxF-CBB pathway and, combined with genomic analyses, suggest that this metabolism is widespread among Bradyrhizobium and Sinorhizobium species.

ImportanceNitrogen-fixing soil bacteria such as Bradyrhizobium and Sinorhizobium promote plant growth while reducing dependence on artificial, energy-intensive fertilizers. Numerous studies have attempted to increase bacterial nitrogen fixation and colonization of plant tissues by identifying the micronutrients and plant exudates that promote successful symbiotic relationships. Among the compounds encountered by rhizobacteria, lanthanides have received little attention, despite reports that plant growth is affected by the presence of lanthanides. We characterized three agriculturally relevant Bradyrhizobium and Sinorhizobium strains, demonstrated that they gain the capacity to utilize methanol when lanthanides are present, and experimentally determined the pathway by which this metabolism occurs. This study provides a foundation for understanding the impacts of bacteria-mediated lanthanide metabolism on plant growth.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166121

The use of cell-free microbial culture filtrates (CF) as biostimulant is gaining ground as a safe and ecologically sound approach to improving crop yields while reducing anthropogenic pressure. However, their action mechanisms remain unknown. Here we found that foliar application of Trichoderma harzianum CF enhanced fruit yield, root growth and photosynthesis in plants of a commercial tomato cultivar grown under long-term water deficit in Mediterranean greenhouse conditions. To investigate the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we adopted an integrative and systems biology approach to characterize plants grown under optimal and suboptimal irrigation conditions (OIC and SOIC, respectively) with or without the fungal CF treatment. Water shortage promoted changes in the levels of drought stress-related signalling molecules, and in the transcriptome of leaves that potentially accounted for the physiochemical differences recorded between OIC- and SOIC-grown plants. Notably, many of these changes were largely prevented by the foliar application of fungal CF to SOIC-grown plants, including the expression of ca. 50% of the expression of water scarcity-responsive genes. These genes did not respond to CF in OIC-grown plants, indicating that the transcriptomic response to CF is strongly determined by the water status of the plant. Taken together, the data provided evidence that foliar application of fungal CF improves yield and long-term water scarcity tolerance by preventing a large portion of the stress-induced transcriptional response, rendering plants ""blind"", or less sensitive to water stress.","NA","biorxiv",1751494166121

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1751494166121

These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. They underscore the need to evaluate vaccines using clinical endpoints that extend beyond their targeted diseases.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1751494166121

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1751494166121

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1751494166121
