The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) integrates multiple metabolic inputs to produce uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a central substrate for protein and lipid glycoconjugates. While UDP-GlcNAc levels influence pluripotency, the broader metabolic roles of the HBP in stem cell maintenance and differentiation remain largely unexplored. Using proteomic and metabolomic analyses, we uncovered extensive enzymatic remodelling of the HBP during early mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation, including a significant decrease in N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P) levels, despite stable UDP-GlcNAc levels. Isotope labelling experiments revealed that pluripotent stem cells maintain UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis through a combination of glucose-driven de novo synthesis and the N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) salvage pathway, both of which are downregulated during differentiation. Functionally, we identified GlcNAc6P--a point of convergence of the de novo synthesis and the salvage pathways--as a pivotal metabolite of stem cell fate. Preventing GlcNAc6P's deacetylation by deleting or depleting AMDHD2 impaired mESC differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GlcNAc6P catabolism is essential for sustaining cytosolic acetate and in turn acetyl-CoA levels, which are critical for lipid synthesis and histone modifications required for pluripotency exit. These findings establish AMDHD2 as a key supplier of cellular acetate and reveal an essential metabolic link between HBP activity and acetyl-CoA homeostasis. By expanding the role of the HBP beyond UDP-GlcNAc production, this study reveals an unrecognised metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to manipulate stem cell identity.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE 2326/3-1;""},{""name"":""JÃ¼rgen Manchot Stiftung"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PhD project Lea Hund;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281200

Players often rely on caffeinated or sugary drinks to combat fatigue, but regular use poses health risks. Sparkling water, a sugar- and caffeine-free beverage, stimulates brainstem and prefrontal activity via sensory pathways mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the throat. We here tested the hypothesis that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play. Fifteen young adult players participated in a randomized crossover trial, each completing two 3-hour sessions of a virtual football game while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (via a flanker task) were measured at baseline and hourly, while pupil diameter and heart rate were monitored continuously. Blood glucose and salivary cortisol were also assessed periodically.

Compared to plain water, sparkling water significantly attenuated increases in subjective fatigue, enhanced enjoyment, and preserved executive function, along with preventing pupil constriction. Heart rate, blood glucose, and salivary cortisol levels did not differ between conditions. Notably, players committed fewer in-game fouls with sparkling water, while offensive and defensive performance remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water alleviates both subjective and objective signs of cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play, supporting our hypothesis. This non-caffeinated intervention may help sustain inhibitory control and promote fair behavior, offering a safe and sustainable strategy for managing mental fatigue in modern life.

Yet, even single-celled organisms exhibit stimulus-responsive, cognitive, actions. To understand how a single cell can coordinate and drive complex behaviours without any neural encoding, we study an algal protist -- a motile cell with four extremely long cilia. The organism displays a surprisingly rich locomotor repertoire, emerging from the intricate dynamics of the cilia, which form a tight bundle when swimming. We leverage high-speed quantitative live imaging to extract the spectrum of possible ciliary beating patterns, and derive a dispersion relation coupling the temporal frequency and spatial wavelength of cilia oscillations. We further reconstruct the attractor manifold embedded in the behavioural space, showing that despite the range and complexity of ciliary beating modes, the underlying behavioural manifold is intrinsically low-dimensional with elaborate topological structure. Dynamic and excitable transitions in motility behaviour are encoded as trajectories in this space.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""853560;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2235451;""},{""name"":""Schmidt Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/044fk6795"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Polymath Award;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

REM sleep comprises about twenty percent of adult sleep, alternates between phasic and tonic periods, and includes delta waves (1-4Hz) in two forms: fast sawtooth waves and slower, NREM-like waves, whose expression dynamically varies across REM periods. Yet, the functional relevance of these REM sleep delta waves remains unknown. Here, using two independent cohorts, we show that aging is associated with a shift from fast sawtooth to slow NREM-like delta waves, particularly during phasic REM sleep, a period typically marked by high cortical activation. Beyond chronological age, this shift is associated with amyloid-beta and tau burden, suggesting that AD pathology disrupts REM-specific oscillatory patterns. Furthermore, this shift in REM oscillations is linked to impaired overnight memory consolidation, independent of NREM sleep quality. Moreover, variation in ApoE alleles, a major genetic risk factor for AD, was independently associated with a reduction in fast sawtooth wave density, thereby linking a genetic predisposition for AD to these specific REM microstructural changes. These findings identify a novel signature of memory decline in aging and implicate REM sleep as a distinct vulnerable substrate through which AD pathology may impair brain function.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF1AG054106;""},{""name"":""Glenn Foundation for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebg5q27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

This assumption underpins predictions about evolutionary dynamics, epistatic interactions, and the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations. Here, we systematically test this assumption using beneficial mutations from early generations of the Escherichia coli Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE). Using flow cytometry-based competition assays, we find that frequency-dependent fitness effects are the norm rather than the exception, occurring in approximately 80% of strain pairs tested. Most competitions exhibit negative frequency-dependence, where fitness advantages decline as mutant frequency increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of frequency-dependence is predictable from invasion fitness measurements, with invasion fitness explaining approximately half of the biological variation in frequency-dependent slopes. Additionally, we observe violations of fitness transitivity in several strain combinations, indicating that competitive relationships cannot always be predicted from fitness relative to a single reference strain alone. Through high-resolution measurements of within-growth cycle dynamics, we show that simple resource competition explains a substantial portion of the frequency-dependence: when faster-growing genotypes dominate populations, they deplete shared resources more rapidly, reducing the time available for fitness differences to accumulate. Our results demonstrate that even in a simple model system designed to minimize ecological complexity, subtle ecological interactions between closely related genotypes create frequency-dependent selection that can fundamentally alter evolutionary dynamics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

In addition, both thought ratings and topics could be decoded from rsFC. Furthermore, neuromarkers of these thoughts generalized to unseen individuals in the Human Connectome Project dataset (N = 908), where decoded thought patterns during rest predicted positive vs. negative trait-level individual differences.

HIV latent reservoir maintenance is a major challenge for ART therapy, especially when immune pressure is waning. This then raises critical questions for HIV-infected patients: does prolonged exposure to S proteins affect HIV latent reservoir stability? Recent studies have pointed out that S proteins may activate the mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn affects the immune response and metabolic processes of cells. And the mTOR pathway is closely related to the maintenance and activation of HIV latent reservoir. However, how S proteins affect the HIV latent reservoir and the mechanism of activation are unclear. To explore the mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 S proteins regulate the HIV latent reservoir and to explore whether S proteins regulate the HIV latent reservoir through the mTOR pathway, we constructed an in vitro HIV latent reservoir model for our experiments.To evaluate the potential role of S protein in HIV latent reservoir activation, relevant markers of HIV latent reservoir activation were detected using ELISA, flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR; and the relationship between S protein and mTOR was also detected by WB, CO-IP, and IFC.It was found that S proteins activated the HIV latent reservoir while increasing mTOR expression. It was further observed that mTOR inhibitors significantly inhibited S protein-induced activation of the HIV latent reservoir, and mTOR activators reversed the inhibitory effect of mTOR inhibitors on HIV latent reservoir activation. In summary, we found that S proteins activated the HIV latent reservoir through the mTOR pathway.

We analyzed major immune cell compartments in PBMCs, as well as specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in CYP with (n=99) and without (n=18) long COVID at three months following acute infection. Our findings indicate that pediatric long COVID is associated with a dysregulated immune response characterized by altered innate immunity and overactivated T-, B- and NK-cell responses. Furthermore, CYP with long COVID had an impaired humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 marked by a dysregulated B-cell compartment and lower levels of anti-RBD IgG and IgA. This correlated with reduced neutralizing capacity against SARS-CoV-2. Random forest analysis identified CCR6 expression on myeloid cells as the most relevant biomarker that distinguishes long COVID from control individuals with 79% accuracy.","[{""name"":""Barcelona City Council and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22S09391-001;""},{""name"":""University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LC2313;""},{""name"":""Catalan Agency of Management of University and Research Grants"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2023 FI-1 00207;2020 BP 00046;""},{""name"":""Gilead Sciences (Spain)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qacef07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EU Gilead Research Scholars Program in HIV award 2021;GLD21-00070;""},{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FJC2021-047205-I;RYC2020-028934-I/AEI/10.13039/501100011033;PID2022-139271OB-I00;CB21/13/00063;""},{""name"":""Horizon Europe research and innovation program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101057100;""},{""name"":""FundaciÃ³ la MaratÃ³ de TV3"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""202130-30-31-32;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

However, lesion studies in humans examining amygdala function have largely focused on its role in processing fear. It currently remains unclear what causal role the human amygdala plays in more complex emotion, motivation and learning processes in daily life. This is because it has not been possible to reversibly modulate amygdala activity non-invasively in humans. Here, we used transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) to bilaterally perturb neural activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). In separate sessions (n = 87), 29 healthy volunteers received offline-TUS to bilateral BLA, mid-insula or sham before playing a novel emotional learning task validated in an independent large cohort online (n = 210). 7T-resting-state and metabolite signals clearly demonstrated target engagement. BLA-TUS reduced the BLAs connectivity fingerprint and decreased its excitation/inhibition balance, suggesting an inhibitory effect of our TUS protocol on BLA activity. In behaviour, BLA-TUS caused a stimulation volume-dependent increase in the tendency to approach neutral, emotionally ambiguous faces, treating them more similarly to happy faces, and a slowing of reaction times for those two emotion categories. These effects were functionally and regionally specific and suggest a causal role for the amygdala in resolving emotional ambiguity. Our results provide important insights for future studies into mood disorders where ambiguous situations might be harder to resolve, which could contribute to existing emotional and learning biases.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223263/Z/21/Z;WT100973AIA;225924/Z/22/Z;225924/Z/22/Z;""},{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X021815/1;""},{""name"":""Leverhulme Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012mzw131"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W003392/1;BB/Y001494/1;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/T019166/1;MR/Y010477/1;MR/Y034368/1;""},{""name"":""Neuromod (Ireland)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02pn2hw69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/W035057/1;""},{""name"":""Advanced Research Investigation Agency"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SCNI-PR01-P15;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

HPAI viruses readily exchange gene segments with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses via reassortment, a mechanism that facilitates pronounced phenotypic change. Observations suggest changes in the seasonality and host range of panzootic viruses, however, data on the role of reassortment in determining such features are limited. Using phylodynamic approaches, we describe the emergence of the panzootic lineage and using a novel global genotype classification system we describe the subsequent emergence and global structuring of genotypes generated by reassortment. Focusing on evolutionary dynamics in Europe, we show reassortment has produced high fitness genotypes with enhanced capacity for transmission and further we show such advantages can be host-dependent, contrasting successful generalist genotypes with a specialist lineage (EA-2022-BB) adapted to birds of the order Charadriiformes. Experimental investigation of NS1-mediated shutoff indicates this Charadriiformes-specialist does not inhibit host cellular gene expression and hamper the defences of more typical hosts such as water- and land-fowl. We attribute this primarily to variation at position 127 of the NS1 protein. Our results emphasise that reassortment has driven phenotypic change, affected viral fitness, and caused diversification of host specificity and seasonality. Such factors should be considered in studies that seek to identify drivers of HPAI spread and map spillover risk. Additionally, relaxation of host specialisation, ecological diversification, and potential endemicity in atypical host populations present new reassortment opportunities that could result in further novel phenotypes.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X006204/1;BB/X006166/1;BB/Y007271/1;BB/Y007298/1;BB/V011286/1;""},{""name"":""BBSRC Institute Strategic Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/RL/230002C;BBS/E/RL/230002D;BBS/E/PI/230002A;BBS/E/PI/230002B;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/Y03368X/1;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""874735;""},{""name"":""Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00tnppw48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SE2223;SE2230;SV3400;SV3032;SV3006;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

Academic researchers often develop custom solutions for specific scientific needs, while industry offerings are typically proprietary and tied to specific hardware. This diversity, while fostering innovation, also creates major challenges in interoperability, reproducibility, and standardization, which slows progress and adaption. This article presents a collaborative effort between academic and industry leaders to survey the current state of smart microscopy, highlight representative implementations, and identify common technical and organizational barriers. We propose a framework for greater interoperability based on shared standards, modular software design, and community-driven development. Our goal is to support collaboration across the field and lay the groundwork for a more connected, reusable, and accessible smart microscopy ecosystem.

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2 based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database. We assessed the predicted interaction structures through different confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we examined annotated protein domains and found that 679 of the predicted structural complexes contained a variety of domains with putative interaction involvement on the basis of interaction interface proximity. Furthermore, our analyses revealed intricate interaction networks within the context of biological function and cancer. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, highlighting both strengths and limitations, while also providing a novel view of broad functional contextualization. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","[{""name"":""Levy-Longenbaugh Donor-Advised Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DBI-2321666;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0019749;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM157729;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B âMeiosisâ;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour lâEducation et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.

A key component of social behavior is approach, where animals actively move to-ward social partners to maintain group cohesion, establish affiliations, and coordinate actions. While a continuous stream of social information is encoded across sensory modalities, it remains unclear whether a distinct neural process underlies social approach. Here, we developed a novel assay in which a head-fixed, tail-free zebrafish interacts with a freely swimming conspecific, enabling precise quantification of social behavior alongside whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution. We demonstrate that zebrafish approach behavior is jointly shaped by spatial and temporal information from conspecifics rather than by these features acting independently. Social approach behavior is preceded by distinct brain-wide neural activity patterns emerging seconds before movement onset, characterized by increased activity in a small subset of forebrain neurons and decreased activity in midbrain and hindbrain neuronal populations. These activity patterns reliably predict upcoming approach movements from each of these regions separately. Moreover, the extent to which neural activity distinguishes approach from non-approach movements predicts individual differences in social behavior, directly linking neural dynamics to behavioral variability. Together, our findings reveal a neural mechanism underlying social approach behavior, highlighting how a distributed yet functionally coordinated network facilitates social interaction.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756073281201
