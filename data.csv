We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980813

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980813

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980813

Here, we describe a general deep-learning-guided approach for de novo design of dynamic changes between intra-domain geometries of proteins, similar to switch mechanisms prevalent in nature, with atom-level precision. We solve 4 structures validating the designed conformations, show microsecond transitions between them, and demonstrate that the conformational landscape can be modulated by orthosteric ligands and allosteric mutations. Physics-based simulations are in remarkable agreement with deep-learning predictions and experimental data, reveal distinct state-dependent residue interaction networks, and predict mutations that tune the designed conformational landscape. Our approach demonstrates that new modes of motion can now be realized through de novo design and provides a framework for constructing biology-inspired, tunable and controllable protein signaling behavior de novo.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980813

Yet, viral tools to access and manipulate fine neuronal subtypes are still limited. Here, we performed systematic analysis of single cell genomic data to identify enhancer candidates for each of the cortical interneuron subtypes. We established a set of enhancer-AAV tools that are highly specific for distinct cortical interneuron populations and striatal cholinergic neurons. These enhancers, when used in the context of different effectors, can target (fluorescent proteins), observe activity (GCaMP) and manipulate (opto- or chemo-genetics) specific neuronal subtypes. We also validated our enhancer-AAV tools across species. Thus, we provide the field with a powerful set of tools to study neural circuits and functions and to develop precise and targeted therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980813

For brevity, we use the term GLP-1 RA to refer to both GLP-1 RA and dual GLP-1 RA/GIP medications.

ObjectiveTo describe recent trends in prescribing and dispensing of GLP-1-based medications in the US.

MethodsUsing a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the US, we identified patients who were prescribed a GLP-1-based medication between January 01, 2018 and March 31, 2024. We describe prescribing volumes and patient characteristics over time, by medication, and by FDA-labeled use. Among the subset of patients for whom post-prescription dispensing data are available, we describe the proportion and characteristics of patients who were and were not dispensed a GLP-1 RA following their prescription.

Results1,055,900 patients were prescribed a GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and March 2024, with 4,161,731 total prescriptions during this period. Among first-time prescriptions for which labeled use could be established, ADMs accounted for 85.0% and AOMs accounted for 15.0%. The most common first-time medication was semaglutide (n = 569,413). Among those with available data, 70.4% of first-time ADM prescriptions overall and 74.1% in December 2023 had a fill within 60 days. By comparison, 43.3% of first-time AOM prescriptions overall and 34.9% in December 2023 had a fill within 60 days.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

This is a powerful approach since it is a multi-region measurement, but because the imaging is done post-mortem, each animal only provides one set of counts. Experiments are expensive and since cells are counted by imaging and aligning a large number of brain sections, they are time-intensive. The resulting datasets tend to be under-sampled with fewer animals than brain regions. As a consequence, these data are a challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We demonstrate that hierarchical Bayesian methods are well suited to these data by presenting a 'standard' partially-pooled Bayesian model for multi-region cell-count data and applying it to two example datasets. For both datasets the Bayesian model outperformed standard parallel t-tests. Overall, the Bayesian approach's ability to capture nested data and its rigorous handling of uncertainty in under-sampled data can substantially improve inference for cell-count data.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

We discover over 100 unique RNA-regulatory effectors in 86 distinct RBPs, presenting evidence that RBPs contain functionally separable domains that dictate their post-transcriptional control of gene expression, and identify some with unique activity at 5' or 3'UTRs. We identify some domains that downregulate gene expression both when recruited to DNA and RNA, and dissect their mechanisms of regulation. Finally, we build a synthetic RNA regulator that can stably maintain gene expression at desired levels that are predictable by a mathematical model.

The lack of a comprehensive understanding on the biology of the disease is paralleled by its dismal survival rates (5-20%). To overcome this challenge, we first identified and prioritized urgently needed resources for clinicians and researchers. Thus, we established genome-wide single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk proteomic data of in vitro and in vivo-generated knockdown models of the pathognomonic DSRCT fusion oncoprotein (EWSR1::WT1) and combined them with an original systems-biology-based pipeline including patient data and the largest histology collection of DSRCTs and morphological mimics available to date. These novel tools were enriched with curated public datasets including patient- and cell line-derived ChIP-seq, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq studies resulting in a multi-model and multi-omic toolbox for discovery analyses. As a proof of concept, our approach revealed the alpha-2/delta subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, CACNA2D2, as a highly overexpressed, super-enhancer driven, direct target of EWSR1::WT1. Single-cell and bulk-level analyses of patient samples and xenografted cell lines highlighted CACNA2D2 as a critical component of our newly established EWSR1::WT1 oncogenic signature, that can be employed to robustly identify DSRCT in reference sets. Finally, we show that CACNA2D2 is a highly sensitive and specific single biomarker for fast, simple, and cost-efficient diagnosis of DSRCT. Collectively, we establish a large-scale multi-omics dataset for this devastating disease and provide a blueprint of how such toolbox can be used to identify new and clinically relevant diagnostic markers, which may significantly reduce misdiagnoses, and thus improve patient care.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Previous studies, including our own research, have shown that specific interneuron subtypes are closely associated with particular pyramidal neuron types, forming stereotyped local inhibitory microcircuits. However, the developmental processes that establish these precise networks are not well understood. Here we show that pyramidal neuron types are instrumental in driving the terminal differentiation and maintaining the survival of specific associated interneuron subtypes. In a wild-type cortex, the relative abundance of different interneuron subtypes aligns precisely with the pyramidal neuron types to which they synaptically target. In Fezf2 mutant cortex, characterized by the absence of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons and an expansion of layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, we observed a corresponding decrease in associated layer 5b interneurons and an increase in layer 6 subtypes. Interestingly, these shifts in composition are achieved through mechanisms specific to different interneuron types. While SST interneurons adjust their abundance to the change in pyramidal neuron prevalence through the regulation of programmed cell death, parvalbumin interneurons alter their identity. These findings illustrate two key strategies by which the dynamic interplay between pyramidal neurons and interneurons allows local microcircuits to be sculpted precisely. These insights underscore the precise roles of extrinsic signals from pyramidal cells in the establishment of interneuron diversity and their subsequent integration into local cortical microcircuits.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

While much of the current understanding of P. syringae is centered on interactions with flowering plants, much less is known about infection in evolutionarily divergent non-flowering lineages. Here, we took a comparative evolutionary approach to understand how P. syringae infects distantly related plants. We identify broad host P. syringae isolates causing significant disease in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and the flowering plant Nicotiana benthamiana, which last shared a common ancestor over 500 million years ago. We demonstrate that phytotoxin enriched isolates belonging to the phylogroup 2 clade of the P. syringae species complex are particularly virulent in non-flowering plants, relying on a combination of type-3 secreted effector proteins and the lipopeptide phytotoxin syringomycin. The application of purified syringomycin promotes necrosis in diverse host tissues and activates conserved genes associated with redox regulation and cell death. Toxin-deficient phylogroups normally unable to infect Marchantia thalli exhibit enhanced bacterial growth when supplemented with exogenous syringomycin, further highlighting its role as a host-range defining factor in Pseudomonas. Collectively our research reveals a key role for the lipopeptide syringomycin in promoting Pseudomonas colonization, which works in concert with type-3 effector proteins to antagonize an exceptionally wide spectrum of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

As the rRNAs and most of the mRNAs in mtDNA are flanked by tRNAs, the release of the mature RNAs occurs mostly by excision of the tRNAs. Processing the non-canonical mRNAs, not flanked by tRNAs, requires FASTKD5, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. To investigate this, we created and characterized a knockout cell line to use as an assay system. The absence of FASTKD5 resulted in a severe combined OXPHOS assembly defect due to the inability to translate mRNAs with unprocessed 5-UTRs. Analysis of RNA processing of FASTKD5 variants allowed us to map amino acid residues essential for function. Remarkably, this map was RNA substrate-specific, arguing against a one size fits all model. A reconstituted in vitro system with purified FASTKD5 protein and synthetic RNA substrates showed that FASTKD5 on its own was able to cleave client substrates correctly, but not non-specific RNA sequences. These results establish FASTKD5 as the missing piece of the biochemical machinery required to completely process the primary mitochondrial transcript.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war (Physalia) is uniquely suited to dispersal, sailing the ocean surface with a muscular crest. We tested the hypothesis of a single, panmictic Physalia population by sequencing 133 genomes, and found five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence showing strong reproductive isolation despite range overlap. We then scored thousands of citizen-science photos and identified four recognizable morphologies linked to these lineages. Within lineages, we detected regionally endemic subpopulations, connected by winds and currents, and identified individual long-distance dispersal events. We find that, even in these sailing species, genetic variation is highly partitioned geographically across the open ocean.

SummaryThe open ocean is a vast and highly connected environment. The organisms that live there have a significant capacity for dispersal and few geographic boundaries to separate populations. Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war or bluebottle (genus Physalia) is uniquely suited to long-distance travel, using its gas-filled float and muscular crest to catch the wind and sail the sea surface. Physalia are distributed across the globe, and like many pelagic organisms, have been hypothesized to represent a massive, well-mixed population that extends across ocean basins. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing whole genomes of 133 samples collected from waters of over a dozen countries around the globe. Our results revealed five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence indicating strong reproductive isolation, despite regions of range overlap. We combined these data with an independent dataset of thousands of images of Physalia uploaded to the citizen-science website inaturalist.org, which we scored for morphological characters including sail size, tentacle arrangement, and color. From these images, we identified four recognizable morphologies, described their geographical distribution, and linked them to four of the lineages identified with genomic data. We conclude there are at least four species, three of which correspond to species proposed by scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries: P. physalis, P utriculus, and P. megalista, along with one as yet unnamed species Physalia sp. from the Tasman Sea. Within each species, we observe significant population structure, with evidence of persistent subpopulations at a regional scale, as well as evidence for individual long-distance dispersal events. Our findings indicate that, instead of one well-mixed, cosmopolitan species, there are in fact multiple Physalia species with distinct but overlapping ranges, each made up of regionally endemic subpopulations that are connected by major ocean currents and wind patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Existing cloning strategies allow to produce constructs for co-expression of proteins, but are often time-consuming, labour-intensive, host-specific, or involving error-prone assembly steps. Here we present a unique set of vectors together with a novel assembly strategy designed to overcome these limitations. It allows for the generation of expression constructs for multi-subunit protein complexes for various hosts in a single cloning step. Its modular nature allows the system to be easily extended to target additional expression hosts or to include new tags or regulatory sequences. As a proof of principle, we present the parallel construction of expression vectors for several Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes, allowing us to devise strategies for the recombinant production of these targets in bacteria, insect cells, and human cells, respectively.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Understanding how behavioral and artifactual variation in these populations relates to climate change and ecology is vital to correctly interpreting the archaeological record, especially given the major climatic and cultural fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Bifacially flaked core tools - which technologically define the tradition - are sometimes regionally and periodically absent within the Acheulean's boundaries. Biface presence is broadly associated with, but rarely formally tested against, environmental conditions. Here, we investigate biface presence/absence and climate/ecological variation at a continental scale between 726 and 130ka. Using a comprehensive sample of European sites matched to paleoenvironmental reconstructions, we demonstrate clear associations between Acheulean presence and specific environments. Acheulean habitat suitability was most strongly associated with mean winter temperatures above -5/-10 degrees C, and precipitation of the driest month above 15 mm. Two major habitats, warm forest/woodland and shrubland, comprised the European Acheulean niche. Acheulean spatial presence was reconstructed through time: during interglacial and glacial periods it covered most of southwestern Europe, but extended along northern coastal routes during interglacials. Central and Eastern Europe always remained unsuitable. The Acheulean was excluded from areas experiencing both low winter temperatures and low summer precipitation, but reached areas including only one of those two climatic extremes, suggesting seasonal migrations to avoid the harshest seasons. These analyses explain current Acheulean site distributions in Europe and suggest strong links between handaxes, specific ecological conditions, and prehistoric demographic patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

While the aetiology of Parkinsons disease remains elusive, the degeneration of the dopamine - producing nigrostriatal neurons, along with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, are pathophysiological hallmarks. The impairment of motor functions, a consequence of the involvement of the thalamic-frontal loop, dominates the overt clinical picture. However, more recent findings clarified that the symptoms are more widespread, and cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunctions are also common. Accordingly, neuroimaging studies show that, even in early disease, structural and functional alterations are not confined to the motor areas. This suggests that the effects of the nigro-striatal neurodegeneration are not restricted to the motor areas alone but, rather, they modify the behavior of the brain on a large scale. Understanding how the local degeneration of dopaminergic neurons affects the whole brain dynamics remains an open question.

The purpose of this study is to understand how the ability of the nigrostriatal pathways to support a dopaminergic stimulation affects the brain as a whole. To this end, we leverage simultaneous recordings from EEG and deep electrodes placed near the subthalamic nuclei (STN) from 10 Parkinsonian patients, acquired both before and after administration of L-Dopa. We used the topography of the spreading of aperiodic waves over a large scale (i.e. neuronal avalanches), utilizing the recently described avalanche transition matrix (ATM), to characterize the brain dynamics. To simulate the effect of L-Dopa in silico, we deployed a mechanistic neural-mass model derived from the adaptive quadratic integrate-and-fire model (aQIF) of individual neurons that has been extended to include dopamine concentration as a variable. Each parcelled brain region is equipped with a neural mass and then coupled according to the empirical connectomes, where connections can be either excitatory, inhibitory, or dopaminergic. Then, the whole-brain dynamics have been simulated for different configurations, i.e., for different dopaminergic tones. This way, we obtained a numerical prediction of the expected dynamics (in terms of properties of the ATMs), as observed in the deep electrodes and the EEG, given different dopaminergic tones. Then, in a Bayesian set-up, we used a class of deep neural networks to ""invert"" the model and infer the most likely dopaminergic tone given the empirically observed dynamics. For all ten patients, we correctly inferred that the dopaminergic tone was higher given the dynamics observed after administration of L-Dopa, and lower before. In other words, we could distinguish and quantify the dopaminergic tone from the electrophysiological data if the subjects had orally taken L-Dopa. This was achieved by integrating the background (anatomical and dynamical) knowledge into model prediction about the physiology of dopamine (as opposed to training a classifier to distinguish empirical data). Finally, we carried out a diagnostic for the validation of the model, as well as a further description of the simulated dopamine dynamics.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

However, aside from the prion protein itself, molecular risk factors are not well understood. Prion and prion-like mechanisms are thought to underpin common neurodegenerative disorders meaning that the elucidation of mechanisms could have broad relevance. Herein we sought to further develop our understanding of the factors that confer risk of sCJD using a systematic gene prioritization and functional interpretation pipeline based on multiomic integrative analyses. Methods We integrated the published sCJD genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with publicly available bulk brain and brain cell type gene and protein expression datasets. We performed multiple transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies (TWAS & PWAS) and Bayesian genetic colocalization analyses (coloc) between sCJD risk association signals and multiple brain molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) signals. We then applied our systematic gene prioritization pipeline on the obtained results and nominated prioritized sCJD risk genes with risk-associated molecular mechanisms in a transcriptome and proteome-wide manner. Results Genetic upregulation of both gene and protein expression of syntaxin-6 (STX6) in the brain was associated with sCJD risk in multiple datasets, with a risk-associated gene expression regulation specific to oligodendrocytes. Similarly, increased gene and protein expression of protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4 (PDIA4), involved in the unfolded protein response, was linked to increased disease risk, particularly in excitatory neurons. Protein expression of mesencephalic astrocyte derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), involved in protection against endoplasmic reticulum stress and sulfatide binding (linking to the enzyme in the final step of sulfatide synthesis, encoded by sCJD risk gene GAL3ST1), was identified as protective against sCJD. In total 32 genes were prioritized into two tiers based on level of evidence and confidence for further studies. Conclusions This study provides insights into the genetically-associated molecular mechanisms underlying sCJD susceptibility and prioritizes several specific hypotheses for exploration beyond the prion protein itself and beyond the previously highlighted sCJD risk loci through the newly prioritized sCJD risk genes and mechanisms. These findings highlight the importance of glial cells, sulfatides and the excitatory neuron unfolded protein response in sCJD pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.

Author summaryAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) play a critical role in the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses. Adaptive changes in AIVs enable them to infect mammalian species by altering viral interactions with host-specific factors, and one well-known example is the PB2-E627K mutation. Fortunately, this mutation is sporadic and rare in AIVs, usually occurring after infecting humans, and AIVs with PB2-627E, which is prevalent in poultry, cannot easily infect humans. However, if an AIV manages to overcome this species barrier, the risk of a pandemic originating from an AIV will significantly increase. In our study, we identified a dual adaptive variant called PB2-627V that combines avian-like properties of PB2-627E and human-like properties of PB2-627K. This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function. The mutation exhibited good fitness in both birds and humans, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. The PB2-627V polymorphism has been found in birds, humans, and mammals worldwide across more than ten AIV subtypes. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, we recommend considering PB2-627V as a new molecular marker to assess the pandemic potential of AIVs.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

Pakistan with its sociocultural and ethnic diversity, has the fifth largest population in the world. There was no prior high-quality nationally representative data on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and their socio-demographic correlates for Pakistan. To fill this gap in the planning of mental health services, the Pakistan Psychiatric Society conducted the National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (NPMS) of Pakistan, in the years 2019-2022.

AimTo estimate the prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of psychiatric morbidity in a representative sample of Pakistan.

MethodsThe cross-sectional NPMS collected data from the four provinces of Pakistan. After selection through a three-stage, stratified, random cluster sampling technique we interviewed 17,773 adults above the age of 18. We used the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI Version 7.0.2) to evaluate psychiatric morbidity. Current and lifetime precise and weighted prevalence is reported according to ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease-10th version). We used multivariate logistic regression to investigate the association between the risk of psychiatric illness and sociodemographic variables. National Bio-ethic Committee of Pakistan granted approval of survey.

ResultsThe lifetime and current weighted prevalence of all psychiatric disorder is 37.91% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) =37.22-38.59) and 32.28% (95% CI=31.62-32.94) respectively. The weighted prevalence of common psychiatric disorders in Pakistan included Mood Disorders (F30-F39; 19.62%), Neurotic and Stress-related Disorders (F40 F48; 24.81%), Psychotic Disorders (F20-F29; 4.52%) and Mental and Behavioural Problems due to Psychoactive Substance use (F10-F19; 0.85%). The psychiatric disorders had an association with age, female gender, urban living, lower income and being divorced. Among participants, 6.17% acknowledged suicidality in the past month, while 1.05% acknowledged a lifetime suicide attempt.

ConclusionThe NPMS is the first nationally representative study of psychiatric morbidities in Pakistan. The data from this survey can be utilized for designing and implementing mental health services and support programmes in the country.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

We have engineered CRISPR-READ, a live cell RNA detector based on the CRISPR-associated Lon protease CalpL and a cA4-producing Type III CRISPR system. Upon RNA-programmable RNA sensing, CRISPR-READ produces an orthogonal second messenger, which leads to the cleavage of a dual FRET / localization reporter compatible with FACS sorting and live microscopy. Using this genetically encoded sensing circuit as a readout for a genome-wide CRISPR perturbation screen, we identified an extended Type-I interferon signaling cascade; RNA-Seq on sensor-sorted cells enabled unbiased identification of correlated stochasticity in gene expression across single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Despite this general heterogeneity, several common factors have been identified. For example, nearly all patients show pathological accumulations of phosphorylated TDP-43 protein in affected regions of the motor cortex and spinal cord. Moreover, large patient cohort studies have revealed that most patient samples can be grouped into a small number of ALS subtypes, as defined by their transcriptomic profiles. These ALS molecular subtypes can be grouped by whether postmortem motor cortex samples display signatures of: mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress (ALS-Ox), microglial activation and neuroinflammation (ALS-Glia), or dense TDP-43 pathology and associated transposable element de- silencing (ALS-TE). In this study, we have built a deep layer ALS neural network classifier (DANcer) that has learned to accurately assign patient samples to these ALS subtypes, and which can be run on either bulk or single-cell datasets. Upon applying this classifier to an expanded ALS patient cohort from the NYGC ALS Consortium, we show that ALS Molecular Subtypes are robust across clinical centers, with no new subtypes appearing in a cohort that has quadrupled in size. Signatures from two of these molecular subtypes strongly correlate with disease duration: ALS-TE signatures in cortex and ALS-Glia signatures in spinal cord, revealing molecular correlates of clinical features. Finally, we use single nucleus RNA sequencing to reveal the cell type- specific contributions to ALS subtype, as determined by our single-cell classifier (scDANCer). Single-cell transcriptomes reveal that ALS molecular subtypes are recapitulated in neurons and glia, with both ALS-wide shared alterations in each cell type as well as ALS subtype-specific alterations. In summary, ALS molecular subtypes: (1) are robust across large cohorts of sporadic and familial ALS patient samples, (2) represent a combination of cellular, genetic, and pathological features, and (3) correlate with clinical features of ALS.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

In eukaryotes, the ubiquitin proteasome system performs most non-lysosomal protein degradation and influences numerous cellular processes. Some bacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), encode a proteasome system that selectively degrades damaged or misfolded proteins crucial for the pathogen's survival within host macrophages. Consequently, the 20S core particle (CP), the central component of the proteasome system, has emerged as a viable target for tuberculosis treatment strategies. Both eukaryotic and Mtb proteasome systems are allosterically regulated, yet the specific conformations involved have not been captured in high-resolution structures to date. Here we present the first structure of Mtb 20S CP, and indeed any 20S CP, in an inactive state called 20SOFF, distinguished from the canonical active state, 20SON, by the conformation of switch helices I and II. The rearrangement of these helices collapses the S1 pocket, effectively inhibiting substrate binding. The switch helices are conserved and regulate the activity of HslV protease, the proteasome's ancestral enzyme in bacteria, and a diverse family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Our results highlight the potential of harnessing allostery to develop therapeutics against the 20S CP in Mtb and eukaryotic systems.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

The latest example is the BA.2.86 Variant Of Interest (VOI), which rapidly outcompeted all other lineages following its detection in late July 2023. Descending sublineages dominated globally by July 2024, at the time of writing this study. The mechanisms by which highly-divergent viral lineages tend to emerge remain unclear, with the most strongly supported hypothesis being the acquisition of multiple mutations through accelerated evolution in chronically infected individuals, with spread back into the community facilitated by prolonged shedding. We used BA.2.86 as a case study to investigate the evolutionary process behind the emergence of a highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variant. Through fine-scale evolutionary analyses applied to four independently subsampled datasets, we identify over 100 genomes representing evolutionary intermediates occupying the branch in the phylogenetic tree leading to the BA.2.86*/JN.1* clade. Additionally, we detected more than 2,600 hybrid genomes across the evolutionary history of the Omicron-descending BA.2* sub-lineages, displaying a sequential acquisition of BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutation constellations through time. We observe that hybrid strains circulated up to 19 months prior to BA.2.86, denoting cryptic circulation in various countries, with further evidence of early transmission chains. We also found signals of recombination between pre-existing parental lineages, suggesting that this process contributed to the emergence of BA.2.86. Our results suggest that the BA.2.86 lineage emerged sequentially through a complex evolutionary process, rather than via accelerated evolution associated with a single emergence event.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

A growing number of T cell-directed therapeutics have demonstrated partial therapeutic efficacy, with anti-CD3 (-CD3) representing the only regulatory agency-approved drug capable of slowing disease progression through a mechanism involving the induction of partial T cell exhaustion. There is an outstanding need to augment the durability and effectiveness of T cell targeting by directly restraining proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (Tc1) subsets, while simultaneously augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Here, we present a novel strategy for reducing diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse model using a blocking monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 diabetes-risk associated T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD226.

MethodsFemale NOD mice were treated with anti-CD226 between 7-8 weeks of age and then monitored for diabetes incidence and therapeutic mechanism of action.

ResultsCompared to isotype-treated controls, anti-CD226 treated NOD mice showed reduced insulitis severity at 12 weeks and decreased disease incidence at 30 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis performed five weeks post-treatment demonstrated reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells in spleens of anti-CD226 treated mice. Phenotyping of pancreatic Tregs revealed increased CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphorylation following anti-CD226, with splenic Tregs displaying augmented suppression of CD4+ T cell responders in vitro. Anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited reduced frequencies of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP)-reactive CD8+ T cells in the pancreas, using both ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) approaches. 51Cr-release assays demonstrated reduced cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells by anti-CD226-treated autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Here we aimed to determine the functional significance of the middle domains by replacing endogenous cMyBP-C with recombinant proteins with and without the middle domains using our cut and paste SpyC3 mouse model. Specifically, we deleted domains C3-C7 or substituted these domains with unrelated Ig-like domains from titin to behave as inert spacer domains. Replacement with the spacer constructs resulted in a significant increase in myofilament calcium sensitivity, an almost instantaneous redevelopment of tension after a slack re-stretch protocol, and altered stretch activation responses, suggesting that the middle domains are functionally relevant and normally exert inhibitory effects on force development. We also investigated the significance of a flexible linker between domains C4 and C5 and a unique 28 amino acid loop insertion in C5. Whereas deletion of the C5 loop had no effect on force, deletion of the linker between C4 and C5 had comparable effects to deletion of domains C3-C7. Taken together, these data indicate that the middle domains play an important role in limiting the activating effects of the C0-C2 domains and that the C4C5 linker contributes to these effects.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Our study analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from mature and developing vertebrate lungs, revealing substantial similarities in cell composition, developmental trajectories and gene expression pattern across species. Notably, most lung-related genes are also present in cartilaginous fishes, indicating that gene presence alone does not guarantee lung development. We identified thousands of lung regulatory elements specific to bony fishes, with higher concentrations around genes such as tbx4 and the hoxb gene cluster. These regulatory changes might contribute to lung emergence as well as the unique co-expression patterns in lung epithelial cells, such as those related to pulmonary surfactants and cell morphology. Our research also revealed that AT1 cells are specific to mammals, and we identified a mammal-specific gene, sfta2.

DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1) is a conserved central regulator of dormancy acting in concert with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) through negative regulation of ABA HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION (AHG) 1 and AHG3 phosphatases. The current molecular mechanism of DOG1 signaling proposes that it regulates the activation state of central ABA-related SnRK2 kinases. Here, we unveil DOG1's functional autonomy from the regulation of ABA core signaling components and unravel its pivotal control over the activation of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE FIVE BINDING PROTEINs (AFPs). Our data revealed a DOG1-AHG1-AFP relay in which AFPs genuine activation by AHG1 is contained by DOG1 to prevent the breakdown of maturation-imposed ABA responses independently of ABA-related kinase activation status.

In Medicago truncatula, their action is mediated by the Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase COMPACT ROOT ARCHITECTURE 2 (CRA2). As most land plants, under inorganic phosphate (Pi) limitation, M. truncatula establishes another root endosymbiotic interaction with arbuscular fungi, the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS). Because this interaction is beneficial for the plant but has a high energetic cost, it is tightly controlled by host plants to limit AMS infections mainly depending on Pi availability. We show in this study that the expression of a subset of CEP encoding genes is enhanced in the low Pi conditions that favour AMS colonization, and that overexpression of the low Pi-induced MtCEP1 gene, previously shown to promote the nitrogen-fixing root nodulation symbiosis, enhances the AMS colonization from the initial entry point of the fungi. Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation of the CRA2 receptor required for mediating CEP peptides action decreases the AMS interaction capacity from the same initial fungal entry stage. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the cra2 mutant is negatively affected in the regulation of key Pi transport and response genes as well as in the biosynthesis of strigolactone (SL) hormones that are required for establishing the AMS interaction. Accordingly, SL contents were drastically decreased in cra2 mutant roots. Overall, we showed that the CEP/CRA2 pathway promotes, in legume plants, both root nodulation and AMS depending on soil mineral nutrients availability.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

There are two classes of TCR/CD3 complexes, defined by their TCR chain usage ({beta} or {gamma}{delta}). Recently reported structures have revealed the organization of the {beta} TCR/CD3 complex, but similar studies regarding the {gamma}{delta} TCR/CD3 complex have lagged behind. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) structural analysis of two full-length {gamma}{delta} TCRs, G115 (V{gamma}9V{delta}2) and 9C2 (V{gamma}5V{delta}1), in complex with CD3 subunits. Our results show that the overall subunit organization of the {gamma}{delta} TCR-CD3 complexes is similar to {beta} TCRs. However, both {gamma}{delta} TCRs display highly mobile extracellular domains (ECDs), unlike {beta} TCRs, which have TCR ECDs that are rigidly coupled to its transmembrane (TM) domains. We corroborate this finding in cells by demonstrating that a {gamma}{delta} T-cell specific antibody can bind a site that would be inaccessible in the more rigid {beta} TCR/CD3 complex. Furthermore, we observed that a V{gamma}5V{delta}1 complex forms a TCR {gamma}5-chain mediated dimeric species whereby two TCR/CD3 complexes are assembled. Collectively, these data shed light on {gamma}{delta} TCR/CD3 complex formation and may aid the design of {gamma}{delta} TCR-based therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

These conditions arise due to disruptions in the mevalonate pathway, which is essential metabolic pathway responsible for the synthesis of non-sterol isoprenoids and other molecules. The resulting metabolic blockade triggers autoinflammatory responses, primarily due to deficient isoprenoid intermediates such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). This first reported pilot study evaluates the safety and efficacy of dietary geranylgeraniol supplementation (GG) in three patients with HIDS. Over three months, GG supplementation showed no liver toxicity and did not alter lipid profiles. Although GG did not rise the plasma levels of GGPP, the plasma proteomics showed significant changes induced by GG. Proteomic analysis further revealed that GG supplementation can reverse some of the features of HIDS-specific plasma protein signature, highlighting its potential to modulate inflammation and protein prenylation pathways. These findings suggest that GG supplementation could be a promising metabolic intervention to mitigate inflammation in HIDS, warranting further, more targeted investigation in larger clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

PhotoFiTT leverages machine learning and cell cycle dynamics to analyse mitotic timing, cell size changes, and overall cellular activity in response to controlled light exposure. Using adherent mammalian cells, we demonstrate PhotoFiTTs ability to detect wavelength- and dose-dependent effects, showcasing that near-UV light induces significant mitotic delays at doses as low as 0.6 J/cm2, while longer wavelengths require higher doses for comparable effects.

Untargeted AAV vectors require high doses to achieve therapeutic efficacy, which is associated with toxic off-target impacts and increased therapeutic costs. The ability to reprogram existing AAV vectors to selectively transduce target tissues is essential to develop next-generation human gene therapies that are safer, more efficacious, and less expensive. Using selective and high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like proteins to retarget existing AAV vectors to bind novel cell-surface receptors offers an attractive and modular approach to reprogram their tropism. However, attaching these proteins onto the complex and delicate AAV capsids remains challenging. Here, we report a versatile chemical strategy to covalently attach recombinant proteins onto the capsid of AAV, using a combination of genetic code expansion and bioorthogonal conjugation chemistry. This method is efficient, and allows precise control over the site and stoichiometry of protein attachment onto the AAV capsid, enabling systematic optimization of the resulting conjugate. Using this approach, we generated conjugates of AAV2 with an anti-HER2 nanobody and a full-length anti-HER2 IgG, which show highly efficient and selective gene delivery into HER2+ cancer cells. Remarkably, the optimized AAV2-nanobody conjugate facilitated efficient transduction of HER2+ tumor xenograft in mice with little off-target gene expression, including in the liver. Programmable synthesis of AAV-protein conjugates using this method offers a promising new strategy to rationally engineer next-generation gene therapy vectors.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Lipotoxicity exerts detrimental effects on pancreatic islet beta cells by reducing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), altering beta cell transcriptional identity, and promoting apoptosis. While beta cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEV) have been shown to contribute to beta cell failure in T2D, their specific role in lipotoxicity-mediated beta cell failure remains to be elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that lipotoxicity enhances the release of sEVs from beta cells, which exhibit altered proteomic and lipidomic profiles. These lipotoxic sEV induce beta cell dysfunction in healthy mouse and human islets and trigger significant islet transcriptional changes, including the upregulation of genes associated with the TGFbeta/Smad3 pathway, as noted by RNA sequencing. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of the TGFbeta I/II receptor improved lipotoxic sEV-induced beta cell dysfunction, underscoring their involvement in activating the TGFbeta/Smad3 pathway during this process. We have comprehensively characterized lipotoxic beta cell sEVs and implicated their role in inducing beta cell functional failure in T2D. These findings highlight potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting sEV-mediated pathways to preserve beta cell health in metabolic disorders.

Multiple evolutionary processes have expanded the set of MutS genes in plants relative to other eukaryotes. Here, we investigate the origins and functions of these plant-specific genes. Land plants, green algae, red algae, and glaucophytes share cyanobacterial-like MutS1 and MutS2 genes that presumably were gained via plastid endosymbiotic gene transfer. MutS1 was subsequently lost in some taxa, including seed plants, whereas MutS2 was duplicated in Viridiplantae (i.e., land plants and green algae) with widespread retention of both resulting paralogs. Viridiplantae also have two anciently duplicated copies of the eukaryotic MSH6 gene (i.e., MSH6 and MSH7) and acquired MSH1 via horizontal gene transfer -- potentially from a nucleocytovirus. Despite sharing the same name, ""plant MSH1"" is not directly related to the gene known as MSH1 in some fungi and animals, which may be an ancestral eukaryotic gene acquired via mitochondrial endosymbiosis and subsequently lost in most eukaryotic lineages. There has been substantial progress in understanding the functions of MSH1 and MSH6/MSH7 in plants, but the roles of the cyanobacterial-like MutS1 and MutS2 genes remain uncharacterized. Known functions of bacterial homologs and predicted protein structures, including fusions to diverse nuclease domains, provide hypotheses about potential molecular mechanisms. Because most plant-specific MutS proteins are targeted to the mitochondria and/or plastids, the expansion of this family appears to have played a large role in shaping plant organelle genetics.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Loss-of-function RBM10 mutations are enriched in thyroid cancers with distant metastases. Analysis of transcriptomes and genes mis-spliced by RBM10 loss showed pro-migratory and RHO/RAC signaling signatures. RBM10 loss increases cell velocity. Cytoskeletal and ECM transcripts subject to exon-inclusion events included vinculin (VCL), tenascin C (TNC) and CD44. Knockdown of the VCL exon inclusion transcript in RBM10-null cells reduced cell velocity, whereas knockdown of TNC and CD44 exon-inclusion isoforms reduced invasiveness. RAC1-GTP levels were increased in RBM10-null cells. Mouse HrasG12V/Rbm1OKO thyrocytes develop metastases that are reversed by RBM10 or by combined knockdown of VCL, CD44 and TNC inclusion isoforms. Thus, RBM10 loss generates exon inclusions in transcripts regulating ECM-cytoskeletal interactions, leading to RAC1 activation and metastatic competency. Moreover, a CRISPR-Cas9 screen for synthetic lethality with RBM10 loss identified NFkB effectors as central to viability, providing a therapeutic target for these lethal thyroid cancers.

The extent of such local adaptation has been shown to depend on a balance between divergent selection and gene flow, but also on other factors such as phenotypic plasticity or the genetic architecture of traits. Here, we explore the role of life history in this process. We develop a quantitative genetics model and run individual-based simulations to contrast the evolution of local adaptation between short- and long-lived species. We show that life history does not have a unidirectional effect on local adaptation. Instead, local adaptation varies with a species' life cycle and how this cycle modulates the scheduling of selection and dispersal among stage classes. When a longer generation time is associated with more frequent events of selection than dispersal, local adaptation is more pronounced in long-lived than in short-lived species. If otherwise dispersal occurs more frequently than selection, long-lived species evolve weaker local adaptation. Our simulations confirm these findings and further highlight how the scheduling of selection and dispersal shape additive genetic variance, effective dispersal between patches, and the genetic response at quantitative trait loci. Taken together, our results suggest that the effect of longevity on local adaptation depends on the specifics of a species' life cycle, potentially explaining why current meta-analyses have not consistently detected this effect.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

With single-cell and spatial-transcriptomics of synovial tissue biopsies, validated by micro co-culture systems, we identified condition and niche-specific myeloid DC clusters with distinct differentiation trajectories and functions. Healthy synovium contains a unique tolerogenic AXLpos DC2 cluster in the superficial sublining layer. In active RA, a macrophage-rich lining-layer niche becomes populated with inflammatory DC3 clusters that specifically activate memory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5posCXCL13pos TPH, promoting synovitis. In the sublining lymphoid niche, CCR7pos DC2 mReg specifically interact with naive-T-cells, potentially driving the local expansion of new effector T-cells.

A human RA disease-flare model showed that the activation of blood predecessor of ST-DC3 clusters precedes the onset of inflammation in joints. Therapeutic strategies targeting pathogenic ST-DC3 clusters, or reinstating tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, may restore immune homeostasis in RA.

However, the lackluster efficacy of CCL2-based chemotaxis blockade in clinical trials suggests that a new understanding of monocyte/macrophage infiltration may be necessary. Here we demonstrate that random migration, and not only chemotaxis, drives macrophage tumor infiltration. We identified tumor-associated monocytes (TAMos) that display a dramatically enhanced migration capability, induced rapidly by the tumor microenvironment, that drives effective tumor infiltration, in contrast to low-motility differentiated macrophages. TAMo, not TAM{Phi}, promotes cancer cell proliferation through activation of the MAPK pathway. IL-6 secreted both by cancer cells and TAMo themselves enhances TAMo migration by increasing dendritic protrusion dynamics and myosin-based contractility via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Independent from CCL2 mediated chemotaxis, IL-6 driven enhanced migration and pro-proliferative effect of TAMo were validated in a syngeneic TNBC mouse model. Depletion of IL-6 in cancer cells significantly attenuated monocyte infiltration and reversed TAMo-induced cancer cell proliferation. This work reveals the critical role random migration plays in monocyte driven TAM{Phi} enrichment in a tumor and pinpoints IL-6 as a potential therapeutic target in combination with CCL2 to ameliorate current strategies against TAM{Phi} infiltration.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

In these molecular assemblies, termed ""coupled transcription-translation complexes"" or ""TTC-B"", RNA polymerase (RNAP) interacts directly with the ribosome, the transcription elongation factor NusG or its paralog RfaH forms a bridge between RNAP and ribosome, and the transcription elongation factor NusA optionally forms a second bridge between RNAP and ribosome.

The results define a new class of coupled transcription-translation complex, termed ""TTC-LC,"" where ""LC"" denotes ""long-range coupling."" TTC-LC differs from TTC-B by a ~60o rotation and ~70 Angstrom translation of RNAP relative to ribosome, resulting in loss of direct interactions between RNAP and ribosome and creation of a ~70 Angstrom gap between RNAP and ribosome. TTC-LC accommodates long mRNA spacers by looping out mRNA from the gap between RNAP and ribosome. We propose that TTC-LC is an intermediate in assembling and disassembling TTC-B, mediating pre-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling before a ribosome catches up to RNAP, and mediating post-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling after a ribosome stops moving and RNAP continues moving.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Diagnostic test reporting of norovirus is often delayed, resulting in incomplete data for real-time surveillance.

MethodsTo nowcast the real-time case burden of norovirus a generalised additive model, semi-mechanistic Bayesian joint process and delay model, and Bayesian structural time series model including syndromic surveillance data were developed. These models were evaluated over weekly nowcasts using a probabilistic scoring framework.

ResultsModelling current cases clearly outperforms a simple heuristic approach. Models that harnessed a time delay correction had higher skill, overall, relative to forecasting techniques. However, forecasting approaches were found to be more reliable in the event of temporally changeable reporting patterns. The incorporation of norovirus syndromic surveillance data was not shown to improve model skill in this nowcasting task, which may be indicative poor correlation between the indicator and norovirus incidence.

InterpretationAnalysis of surveillance data enhanced by nowcasting reporting delays improves understanding over simple model assumptions, which is important for real-time decision making. The structure of the modelling approach needs to be informed by the patterns of the reporting delay and can have large impacts on operational performance and insights produced.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

Cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs), first recognized as the photoreceptors in the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have since been identified in diverse species of green algae, as well in other unicellular eukaryotes. The CCRs from non-chlorophyte species are commonly referred to as bacteriorhodopsin-like channelrhodopsins, or BCCRs, as most of them feature the three characteristic amino acid residues of the ""DTD motif"" in the third transmembrane helix (TM3 or helix C) matching the canonical DTD motif of the well-studied archaeal light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. Here, we report characterization of HulaCCR1, a novel BCCR identified through metatranscriptomic analysis of a unicellular eukaryotic community in Lake Hula, Israel. Interestingly, HulaCCR1 has an ETD motif in which the first residue of the canonical motif is substituted for glutamate. Electrophysiological measurements of the wild-type and a mutant with a DTD motif of HulaCCR1 suggest the critical role of the first glutamate in spectral tuning and channel gating. Additionally, HulaCCR1 exhibits long extensions at the N- and C-termini. Photocurrents recorded from a truncated variant without the signal peptide predicted at the N-terminus were diminished, and membrane localization of the truncated variant significantly decreased, indicating that the signal peptide is important for membrane trafficking of HulaCCR1.

For that reason, publishing images of individuals affected by pathogenic variants in disease-associated genes has been an important part of scientific communication. Furthermore, medical imaging data is also crucial for teaching and training artificial intelligence methods such as GestaltMatcher. However, medical data is often sparsely available and sharing patient images involves risks related to privacy and re-identification. Therefore, we explored whether generative neural networks can be used to synthesize accurate portraits for rare disorders. We modified a StyleGAN architecture and trained it to produce random condition-specific portraits for multiple disorders. We present a technique that generates a sharp and detailed average patient portrait for a given disorder. We trained our GestaltGAN on the 20 most frequent disorders from the GestaltMatcher database. We used REAL-ESRGAN to increase the resolution of portraits from the training data with low quality and colorized black-and-white images. The training data was aligned and cropped to achieve a uniform format. To augment the models understanding of human facial features, an unaffected class was introduced to the training data.

We tested the validity of our generated portraits with 63 human experts. Our findings demonstrate the models proficiency in generating photorealistic portraits that capture the characteristic features of a disorder but preserve the patients privacy. Overall, the output from our approach holds promise for various applications, including visualizations for publications, educational materials, as well as augmenting training data for deep learning.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

Most human pre-implantation are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells, however, mosaic embryos with a low proportion of aneuploid cells have a similar likelihood of developing to term as fully euploid embryos. How embryos manage aneuploidy during development is poorly understood. This knowledge is crucial for improving fertility treatments and reducing developmental defects. To explore these mechanisms, we established a new mouse model of chromosome mosaicism to study the fate of aneuploid cells during pre-implantation development. We previously used the Mps1 inhibitor reversine to generate aneuploidy in embryos. Here, we found that treatment with the more specific Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 induced chromosome segregation defects in pre-implantation embryos, similar to reversine. However, AZ3146- treated embryos showed a higher developmental potential than reversine-treated embryos. Unlike reversine-treated embryos, AZ3146-treated embryos exhibited transient upregulation of Hypoxia Inducible-Factor-1A (HIF1A) and lacked p53 upregulation. Pre-implantation embryos develop in a hypoxic environment in vivo, and hypoxia exposure in vitro reduced DNA damage in response to Mps1 inhibition and increased the proportion of euploid cells in the mosaic epiblast. Inhibiting HIF1A in mosaic embryos also decreased the proportion of aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos. Our work illuminates potential strategies to improve the developmental potential of mosaic embryos.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Their genomes encode extensive repertoires of secreted effector proteins that suppress host immunity. Here, we revised and analyzed the candidate secreted effector protein (CSEP) effectome of the barley powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria hordei (Bh) and identified seven CSEPs that are broadly conserved in powdery mildew fungal species, rendering them core effectors of these phytopathogens. We show that one of these, CSEP0214, interacts with the barley VPS18 protein, a core component of the CORVET and HOPS endosomal tethering complexes, mediating fusions of early endosomes and multivesicular bodies with the central vacuole, respectively. Overexpression of CSEP0214 and knockdown of either VPS18, HOPS-specific VPS41 or CORVET-specific VPS8 caused a block of the vacuolar pathway and the accumulation of the fluorescent vacuolar marker protein (SP)-RFP-AFVY in the endoplasmic reticulum. Co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that CSEP0214 blocks the interaction of VPS18 and VPS16, which are both core components of CORVET as well as HOPS. Additionally, expression of CSEP0214 blocked the hypersensitive cell death response associated with resistance gene-mediated immunity in barley, indicating that endomembrane traffic is required for this process. It also prevented callose deposition in cell wall appositions at attack sites and encasements of fungal infection structures. Our results indicate that this powdery mildew core effector is an essential immunity suppressor.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Exogenous auxin application is necessary for inducing embryogenic responses in in vitro cultured explants of Arabidopsis and other plants. Thus, components of auxin transport, signaling, and metabolism are key to somatic embryo formation. AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors, which bind to auxin response elements to control the auxin-responsive gene expression, are vital in somatic embryo regeneration. ARFs are often repressed by AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACIDs (Aux/IAAs). MONOPTEROS (MP)/ARF5 is especially important in the embryogenic transition, being highly expressed during somatic embryogenesis; its mutant cannot develop somatic embryos. The MP11ir transcript, an alternatively spliced variant of MP/ARF5, produces a truncated protein missing the Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain, crucial for ARF-Aux/IAA dimerization. This makes the MP11ir isoform insensitive to Aux/IAA repression, suggesting auxin-independent regulation. High levels of MP11ir transcript are observed during auxin- and trichostatin A-dependent induction of somatic embryogenesis. Both MP/ARF5 and MP11ir are essential for embryo regeneration in the mpS319 mutant. However, overexpressing truncated MP/ARF5 protein (DeltaARF5) lacking the PB1 domain inhibits somatic embryogenesis, leading to callus formation instead of somatic embryos. Overexpressing DeltaARF5, lacking MP/ARF5 protein (mp/arf5 mutant), and blocking of MP/ARF5 action with auxin-resistant BODENLOS (BDL) protein affect the expression of genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, like TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA1), TAA1-RELATED 1 (TAR1), YUCCA3 (YUC3), YUC5 and YUC8, which may be potential targets of MP11ir and/or MP/ARF5. Consequently, DeltaARF5 overexpression alters auxin homeostasis and endogenous auxin levels, hindering embryogenic transition.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

While PacBio HiFi sequencing data enhances the accessibility of the genomes TR regions for genotyping, simple de novo calling strategies often generate an excess of likely false positives, which can obscure true positive findings, particularly as the number of surveyed genomic regions increases.

ResultsWe developed TRGT-denovo, a computational method designed to accurately identify all types of de novo TR mutations--including expansions, contractions, and compositional changes-- within family trios. TRGT-denovo directly interrogates read evidence, allowing for the detection of subtle variations often overlooked in variant call format (VCF) files. TRGT-denovo improves the precision and specificity of de novo mutation (DNM) identification, reducing the number of de novo candidates by an order of magnitude compared to genotype-based approaches. In our experiments involving eight rare disease trios previously studied TRGT-denovo correctly reclassified all false positive DNM candidates as true negatives. Using an expanded repeat catalog, it identified new candidates, of which 95% (19/20) were experimentally validated, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing likely false positives while maintaining high sensitivity for true discoveries.

Antioxidant delivery as a therapeutic for AAA is of substantial interest although clinical translation of antioxidant therapy has met with significant challenges due to limitations in achieving sufficient antioxidant levels at the site of AAA. We posit that nanoparticle-based approaches hold promise to overcome challenges associated with systemic administration of antioxidants.

MethodsWe employed a peptide-based nanoplatform to overexpress a key modulator of oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). The efficacy of systemic delivery of SOD2 mRNA as a nanotherapeutic agent was studied in two different murine AAA models. Unbiased mass spectrometry-enabled proteomics and high-dimensional bioinformatics were used to examine pathways modulated by SOD2 overexpression.

ResultsThe murine SOD2 mRNA sequence was mixed with p5RHH, an amphipathic peptide capable of delivering nucleic acids in vivo to form self-assembled nanoparticles of [~]55 nm in diameter. We further demonstrated that the nanoparticle was stable and functional up to four weeks following self-assembly when coated with hyaluronic acid. Delivery of SOD2 mRNA mitigated the expansion of small AAA and largely prevented rupture. Mitigation of AAA was accompanied by enhanced SOD2 protein expression in aortic wall tissue. Concomitant suppression of nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and cell death was observed. Proteomic profiling of AAA tissues suggests that SOD2 overexpression augments levels of microRNAs that regulate vascular inflammation and cell apoptosis, inhibits platelet activation/aggregation, and downregulates mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Gene set enrichment analysis shows that SOD2 mRNA delivery is associated with activation of oxidative phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, respiratory electron transportation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways.

ConclusionsThese results confirm that SOD2 is key modulator of oxidative stress in AAA. This nanotherapeutic mRNA delivery approach may find translational application in the medical management of small AAA and the prevention of AAA rupture.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

These protofibrils and fibrils can intertwine to form mature amyloid fibres. Similar phenomena occur in blood from individuals with circulating inflammatory molecules (also those originating from viruses and bacteria). In the presence of inflammagens, pathological clotting can occur, that results in an anomalous amyloid form termed fibrinaloid microclots. Previous proteomic analyses of these microclots have shown the presence of non-fibrin(ogen) proteins, suggesting a more complex mechanism than simple entrapment. We provide evidence against a simple entrapment model, noting that clot pores are too large and centrifugation would have removed weakly bound proteins. Instead, we explore whether co-aggregation into amyloid fibres may involve axial (multiple proteins within the same fibril), lateral (single-protein fibrils contributing to a fibre), or both types of integration. Our analysis of proteomic data from fibrinaloid microclots in different diseases shows no significant overlap with the normal plasma proteome and no correlation between plasma protein abundance and presence in microclots. Notably, abundant plasma proteins like -2-macroglobulin, fibronectin, and transthyretin are absent from microclots, while less abundant proteins such as adiponectin, periostin, and von Willebrand Factor are well represented. Using bioinformatic tools including AmyloGram and AnuPP, we found that proteins entrapped in fibrinaloid microclots exhibit high amyloidogenic tendencies, suggesting their integration as cross-{beta} elements into amyloid structures. This integration likely contributes to the microclots resistance to proteolysis. Our findings underscore the role of cross-seeding in fibrinaloid microclot formation and highlight the need for further investigation into their structural properties and implications in thrombotic and amyloid diseases. These insights provide a foundation for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting amyloidogenic cross-seeding in blood clotting disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

Specifically, BLAST reports the E-value of each reported alignment, which is defined as the expected number of optimal local alignments that will score at least as high as the observed alignment score, assuming that the query and the database sequences are randomly generated.

Here we critically evaluate the E-values provided by the standard protein BLAST (blastp), showing that they can be at times significantly conservative while at others too liberal. We offer an alternative approach based on generating a small sample from the null distribution of random optimal alignments, and testing whether the observed alignment score is consistent with it. In contrast with blastp, our significance analysis seems valid, in the sense that it did not deliver inflated significance estimates in any of our extensive experiments. Moreover, although our method is slightly conservative, it is often significantly less so than the blastp E-value. Indeed, in cases where blastps analysis is valid (i.e., not too liberal), our approach seems to deliver a greater number of correct alignments. One advantage of our approach is that it works with any reasonable choice of substitution matrix and gap penalties, avoiding blastps limited options of matrices and penalties. In addition, we can formulate the problem using a canonical family-wise error rate control setup, thereby dispensing with E-values, which can at times be difficult to interpret.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

We use surface morphometrics tools to identify a subset of ribosomes optimally oriented on mitochondrial membranes for protein import. This allows us to establish the first subtomogram average structure of a cytoplasmic ribosome on the surface of the mitochondria in the native cellular context, which showed three distinct connections with the outer mitochondrial membrane surrounding the peptide exit tunnel.

The SNAP-tag, which covalently conjugates to benzyl-guanine and -chloropyrimidine derivatives is used extensively in fluorescence microscopy, given the availability of suitable SNAP-ligand-based probes. Here, we extend the applicability of the SNAP-tag to targeted protein degradation. We developed a set of SNAP PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (SNAP-PROTACs), which recruit the VHL or CRBN-ubiquitin E3 ligases to induce the degradation of SNAP-fusion proteins. Endogenous tagging enabled the visualization and the selective depletion of a SNAP-clathrin light chain fusion protein using SNAP-PROTACs. The addition of PROTACs to the SNAP-tag reagent toolbox facilitates the comprehensive analysis of protein function with a single gene tagging event.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

There are no vaccines available and no effective treatments for these patients. Another challenge is that Cryptosporidia are waterborne and resistant to common water treatments including chlorination. Cryptosporidia are transmitted as an oocyst that is made up of a hardy oocyst wall that protects four parasites. Little is understood about how the oocyst is constructed, its composition, and the how it resists chlorination. A family of predicted Cryptosporidium Oocyst Wall Proteins (COWPs) was identified from the genome. Using a genetic approach, we confirm that all members of the COWP family localise to the oocyst wall. Our studies indicate that COWP2, 3 and 4 localise specifically to the oocyst suture, a zipper-like structure on the oocyst wall from which parasites emerge during infection. In parasites lacking COWP8, we observe that the inner and outer layers of the oocyst wall are no longer associated suggesting a role for COWP8 in oocyst wall morphology. Despite loss of COWP8, these transgenic parasites are viable, unchanged in mechanical strength, and retain resistance to chlorination. This work sets the foundation for future exploration of Cryptosporidium transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

However, a comprehensive model that investigates the association between a broad range of psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated disease in a multivariate framework is lacking.

ObjectiveThis study aims to establish a factor structure based on the genetic correlations of immune-mediated diseases and investigate their genetic relationships with clusters of psychiatric disorders.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe utilized Genomic Structural Equation Modeling (Genomic SEM) to establish a factor structure of 11 immune-mediated diseases. Genetic correlations between these immune factors were examined with five established factors across 13 psychiatric disorders representing compulsive, schizophrenia/bipolar, neurodevelopmental, internalizing, and substance use disorders. We included GWAS summary statistics of individuals of European ancestry with sample sizes from 1,223 cases for Addisons disease to 170,756 cases for major depressive disorder.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresGenetic correlations between psychiatric and immune-mediated disease factors and traits to determine genetic overlap. We develop and validate a new heterogeneity metric, QFactor, that quantifies the degree to which factor correlations are driven by more specific pairwise associations. We also estimate residual genetic correlations between pairs of psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases.

ResultsA four-factor model of immune-mediated diseases fit the data well and described a continuum from autoimmune to autoinflammatory diseases. The four factors reflected autoimmune, celiac, mixed pattern, and autoinflammatory diseases. Analyses revealed seven significant factor correlations between the immune and psychiatric factors, including autoimmune and mixed pattern diseases with the internalizing and substance use factors, and autoinflammatory diseases with the compulsive, schizophrenia/bipolar, and internalizing factors. Additionally, we find evidence of divergence in associations within factors as indicated by QFactor. This is further supported by 14 significant residual genetic correlations between individual psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases.

Conclusion and RelevanceOur results revealed genetic links between clusters of immune-mediated diseases and psychiatric disorders. Current analyses indicate that previously described relationships between specific psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases often capture broader pathways of risk sharing indexed by our genomic factors, yet are more specific than a general association across all psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow do immune-mediated diseases cluster together and how are they associated with clusters of psychiatric disorders?

FindingsImmune-mediated diseases cluster into four factors along the overlapping spectrum of autoimmune to autoinflammatory diseases. There are seven significant factor correlations between immune-mediated disease factors and psychiatric disorders factors along with more specific pairwise associations between two disease traits.

MeaningImmune-mediated diseases are genetically associated with psychiatric disorders. While some associations seem to be driven by more general pathways, we also find that some of the shared signal is more specific to individual psychiatric-immune disease pairs.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

ObjectivesIn a post hoc 10-year follow-up analysis of the MI-GENES trial, we investigated whether disclosure of a PRS for CHD was associated with a reduction in adverse cardiovascular events.

MethodsParticipants were followed from randomization beginning in October 2013 until September 2023 to ascertain adverse cardiovascular events, testing for CHD, and changes in risk factors, by blinded review of electronic health records. The primary outcome was the time from randomization to the occurrence of the first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and non-fatal stroke. Statistical analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression and linear mixed-effects models.

ResultsWe followed all 203 participants who completed the MI-GENES trial, 100 in FRSg and 103 in IRSg (mean age at the end of follow-up: 68.2{+/-}5.2, 48% male). During a median follow-up of 9.5 years, 9 MACEs occurred in FRSg and 2 in IRSg (hazard ratio (HR), 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04 to 0.94; P=0.042). In FRSg, 47 (47%) underwent at least one test for CHD, compared to 30 (29%) in IRSg (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.81; P=0.004). IRSg participants had a longer duration of statin therapy during the first four years post-randomization and a greater reduction in LDL-C for up to 3 years post-randomization. No significant differences between the two groups were observed for hemoglobin A1C, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, weight, and smoking cessation rate during follow-up.

ConclusionsThe disclosure of an IRS that included a PRS to individuals at intermediate risk for CHD was associated with a lower incidence of MACE after a decade of follow-up, likely due to a higher rate of initiation and longer duration of statin therapy, leading to lower LDL-C levels.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

Homologous with ATP synthases, these multi-subunit enzymes consist of a soluble catalytic V1 subcomplex and a membrane-embedded proton-translocating VO subcomplex. The V1 and VO subcomplexes can undergo reversible dissociation to regulate proton pumping, with reassociation of V1 and VO requiring the protein complex known as RAVE (regulator of the ATPase of vacuoles and endosomes). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAVE consists of subunits Rav1p, Rav2p, and Skp1p. We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a structure of yeast RAVE bound to V1. In the structure, RAVE is a L-shaped complex with Rav2p pointing toward the membrane and Skp1p distant from both the membrane and V1. Only Rav1p interacts with V1, binding to a region of subunit A not found in the corresponding ATP synthase subunit. When bound to RAVE, V1 is in a rotational state suitable for binding the free VO complex, but it is partially disrupted in the structure, missing five of its 16 subunits. Other than these missing subunits and the conformation of the inhibitory subunit H, the V1 complex with RAVE appears poised for reassembly with VO.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations.

MethodsA large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1721685980814

Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1721685980814
