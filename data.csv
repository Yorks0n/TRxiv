Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1740262086482

Predictive biomarkers and effective therapies are urgently needed for the clinical management of Long COVID. Neurological manifestations (poor memory, brain fog) are frequent, while neurodamage and neuroinflammatory markers UCHL1, GFAP and NFL were found to be increased in some but not all Long COVID cohorts. However, a direct link between two major Long COVID disease mechanisms, viral persistence and coagulation defects, and CNS damage is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of combined anticoagulant (Asaflow + Clopidogrel) vs. antiviral (Paxlovid) treatment upon clinical outcome and neurodamage markers in Long COVID patients. Using multivariate logistic regression, we found that second-line antiviral treatment is the single best predictor of clinical recovery in a real-world Long COVID cohort (n=106) with long-term (220 person-years) follow-up. Our results support a putative role for viral persistence in Long COVID pathogenesis but also indicate a large therapeutic window for Paxlovid and other antivirals. A rapid decline in neurodamage markers (GFAP/NFL) upon antiviral treatment suggests CNS damage in Long COVID might be therapeutically targeted and should be considered in ongoing and future clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1740262086482

Plasmids are extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements that underlie much of the evolutionary flexibility of bacteria. Evolving plasmids face selective pressures on their hosts, but also compete within the cell for replication, making them an ideal system for studying the joint dynamics of multilevel selection. While theory indicates that within-cell selection should matter for plasmid evolution, experimental measurement of within-cell plasmid fitness and its consequences has remained elusive. Here we measure the within-cell fitness of competing plasmids and characterize drift and selective dynamics. We achieve this by the controlled splitting of synthetic plasmid dimers to create balanced competition experiments. We find that incompatible plasmids co-occur for longer than expected due to methylation-based plasmid eclipsing. During this period of co-occurrence, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell selective advantage over their competing plasmids, leading to preferential fixation of silent plasmids. When the transcribed gene is beneficial to the cell, for example an antibiotic resistance gene, there is a cell-plasmid fitness tradeoff mediated by the dominance of the beneficial trait. Surprisingly, more dominant plasmid-encoded traits are less likely to fix but more likely to initially invade than less dominant traits. Taken together, our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by dynamics at two levels, with a transient, but critical, contribution of within-cell fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Currently, limited information exists about long-term oral health manifestations in COVID-19 patients with limited healthcare access.

MethodsWe conducted a sequential, cross-sectional study (December 2020-March 2024) to assess how racial/ethnic differences (Black/Hispanic vs White/Asian) and health disparities affect oral and non-oral long COVID symptoms and their relationship with COVID-19 vaccination. We retrospectively reviewed patients oral health record from University of Illinois Chicago dental clinics before vaccination (December 2020; N=1150; Covid+/- N=575/group) and after vaccination (December 2021; N=592; Covid+/- N=292/group). Participants were recruited in two separate prospective groups of COVID-19 positive subjects (February-April 2021; pre-vaccination: N=158; January-March 2024; post-vaccination: N=171), we examined clinical indicators of oral (periodontal and salivary glands) and non-oral (neurologic) sequalae 3-6 months after initial exposure. We measured viral S protein by flow cytometry and quantified inflammatory markers, viral entry receptors, and oral viral load to correlate molecular, and cellular changes in COVID-19 positive subjects before and after vaccination.

ResultsOur results identified racial disparity indicating oral associated post-acute sequelae (PASC) primarily manifested as periodontal (gum) disease (COVID-19 positive: 73.1{+/-}18.9% vs COVID-19 negative: 33.1{+/-}14.3%) and correlated with higher rates of dry mouth (57.5%), taste disturbance (47%), and smell loss (20%). Vaccination reduced oral PASC in COVID-19 positive subjects; however, periodontal disease indicators persisted compared to the COVID-19 negative group. Notably, 3-6 months post-infection, while SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) transcript was rarely detected in saliva ([~]6%), its protein was commonly detected ([~]70%) in the COVID-19 positive subjects indicating incomplete viral clearance. This correlates with significantly higher salivary expression of viral entry receptors (ACE2, and TRMPSS2), and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-8), in COVID-19 positive subjects. This finding was further supported by higher prevalence of other oral viruses including Epstein-Barr Virus (70.5%), Herpes Simplex Virus (8.1%), and Human Papillomavirus (17.5%) in COVID-19 positive subjects.

InterpretationCOVID-19 history significantly correlates with severe oral health complications in predominantly Black communities, while vaccination reduced but did not eliminate these issues. The oral cavity serves as a long-term viral reservoir, and periodontal inflammation with increased oral viral presence in COVID-positive patients may increase susceptibility to oral and non-oral viral diseases and identify risk for long COVID.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

However, isotropic resolution for a centimeter-sized sample has only been achieved with slow and often aberrated, axially scanned light sheets, resulting in a low resolution of several micrometers. Here, we introduce a compact, high-speed light sheet fluorescence microscope with isotropic sub-micron resolution optimized for cleared tissue. We introduce three major opto-mechanical innovations using off-the-shelf optics to achieve an isotropic resolution of 850 nm across samples up to 1 cm3 and refractive indices ranging from 1.33 to 1.56. We show that combining an air objective and a meniscus lens achieves an axially swept light sheet with sub-micron diffraction-limited resolution, free of aberrations. The effective field of view is increased 2-fold by correcting the field curvature of the light sheet with a concave mirror in the remote focusing unit. Furthermore, the imaging speed is enhanced 10-fold by adapting the light sheet's motion with a closed-loop feedback, reaching 100 frames per second while maintaining isotropic resolution across the large field of view. Finally, we showcase the performance of our light sheet system for imaging from subcellular up to centimeter scale in cleared mouse cochlea and brain.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

However, challenges persist in capturing sidechain packing, condition-dependent conformational dynamics, and biomolecular interactions, primarily due to scarcity of high-quality training data. Emerging techniques, including cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and high-throughput crystallography, promise vast new sources of structural data, but translating raw experimental observations into mechanistically interpretable atomic models remains a key bottleneck. Here, we aim to address these challenges by improving the efficiency of structural analysis through combining experimental measurements with a landmark protein structure prediction method -- AlphaFold2. We present an augmentation of AlphaFold2, ROCKET, that refines its predictions using cryo-EM, cryo-ET, and X-ray crystallography data, and demonstrate that this approach captures biologically important structural variation that AlphaFold2 does not. By performing structure optimization in the space of coevolutionary embeddings, rather than Cartesian coordinates, ROCKET automates difficult modeling tasks, such as flips of functional loops and domain rearrangements, that are beyond the scope of current state-ofthe-art methods and, in some instances, even manual human modeling. The ability to efficiently sample these barrier-crossing rearrangements unlocks a new horizon for scalable and automated model building. Crucially, ROCKET does not require retraining of AlphaFold2 and is readily adaptable to multimers, ligand-cofolding, and other data modalities. Conversely, our differentiable crystallographic and cryo-EM target functions are capable of augmenting other structure prediction methods. ROCKET thus provides an extensible framework for the integration of experimental observables with biomolecular machine learning.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

In this study, we established a working model to investigate chromosome dynamics in S. aureus using a Fluorescent Repressor-Operator System (FROS), which enabled precise localization of specific chromosomal loci. This approach revealed that the S. aureus cell cycle and chromosome replication cycle are not coupled, with cells exhibiting two segregated origins of replication at the start of the cell cycle. The chromosome has a specific origin-terminus-origin conformation, with origins localizing near the membrane, towards the tip of each hemisphere, or the ""cell poles"". We further used this system to assess the role of various proteins with a role in S. aureus chromosome biology, focusing on the ParB-parS and SMC-ScpAB systems. Our results demonstrate that ParB binds five parS chromosomal sequences and the resulting complexes influence chromosome conformation, but play a minor role in chromosome compaction and segregation. In contrast, the SMC-ScpAB complex plays a key role in S. aureus chromosome biology, contributing to chromosome compaction, segregation and spatial organization. Additionally, we systematically assessed and compared the impact of proteins linking chromosome segregation to cell division--Noc, FtsK, SpoIIIE and XerC--on origin and terminus number and positioning.

Computational chemistry and machine learning methods have been developed to investigate these tasks. Despite the encouraging performance, virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization are often studied separately by existing methods, partially because they are performed sequentially in the existing drug discovery pipeline, thereby overlooking their interdependency and complementarity. To address this problem, we propose LigUnity, a foundation model for protein-ligand binding prediction by jointly optimizing virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization. In particular, LigUnity learns coarse-grained active/inactive distinction for virtual screening, and fine-grained pocket-specific ligand preference for hit-to-lead optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of LigUnity on eight benchmarks across both tasks. In virtual screening, LigUnity outperforms 24 competing methods with more than 50% improvement on the DUD-E and Dekois 2.0 benchmarks, and shows robust generalization to novel proteins. In hit-to-lead optimization, LigUnity achieves the best performance on split-by-time, split-by-scaffold, and split-by-unit settings, further demonstrating its potential as a cost-effective alternative to free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. We further showcase how LigUnity can be employed in an active learning framework to efficiently identify active ligands for TYK2, a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases, yielding over 40% improved prediction performance. Collectively, these comprehensive results establish LigUnity as a versatile foundation model for both virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization, offering broad applicability across the drug discovery pipeline through accurate protein-ligand affinity predictions.

In vivo chromatin measurements and coarse-grained simulations at near-atomistic resolution show the active transcription state is characterized by a highly dynamic nucleosome arrangement that exposes the FLC TSS. Cold exposure then changes the chromatin structure by reducing nucleosome dynamics and re-positioning the +1 nucleosome, leading to transcriptional repression. This local chromatin transition partially depends on VRN1, a non-sequence-specific DNA-binding protein.

Insertion sequences, the simplest MGEs usually encoding only the necessary genes for transposition and maintenance, are widespread in bacterial genomes, and are particularly common in plasmids. Plasmids, self-replicating extrachromosomal DNA elements, often exist in multiple copies imparting a stochastic barrier to the fixation of an insertion sequence by limiting the proportion of the plasmid population harboring the IS. In this work we demonstrate that to overcome this, the IS200/605 family of insertion sequences utilizes programmable RNA guided nucleases as gene drive to spread the IS through the plasmid population. TnpB, the likely ancestor of Cas12, records the specific insertion site of the IS in its RNA guide to prevent loss of the IS during transposition. When introduced to a plasmid TnpB will be reprogrammed to target and cleave IS- plasmids, resulting in biased replication of only those IS+ plasmids. Furthermore, the gene drive activity is critical for the IS to invade high copy plasmid populations. Because TnpB can only be mobilized between microbes on other mobile genetic elements, this advantage to fixing in plasmids may help explain the prevalence of TnpB across the tree of life. More generally, the unique pressures arising from movement between genetic contexts with different multiplicities shapes the evolution of strategies for MGE spread.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

But the extent to which substantial spatial differences exist in ATP concentration in the cell remains incompletely known. It is variously argued that ATP diffuses too quickly for large gradients to be established, or that the high rates of ATP production and use (sources and sinks) can support large gradients even with rapid diffusion - and microscopic models and detailed experiments in different specific cases support both pictures. Here we attempt a mesoscopic investigation, using reaction-diffusion modelling in a simple biophysical picture of the cell to attempt to ask, generally, which conditions cause substantial ATP gradients to emerge within eukaryotic cells. If ATP sources (like mitochondria) or sinks (like the nucleus) are spatially clustered, large fold changes in concentration can exist across the cell; if sources and sinks are more spread then rapid diffusion indeed prevents large gradients being established. This dependence holds in model cells of different sizes, suggesting its generality across cell types.

To address this, we present FAMPNN (Full-Atom MPNN), a sequence design method that explicitly models both sequence identity and sidechain conformation for each residue, where the per-token distribution of a residues discrete amino acid identity and its continuous sidechain conformation are learned with a combined categorical cross-entropy and diffusion loss objective.

Conversely, syntaxin-6 does not affect prion propagation kinetics or toxicity during established disease. Syntaxin-6 manipulation in cellular models profoundly alters the subcellular distribution and morphologies of disease-related PrP and modifies prion export. Furthermore, syntaxin-6 knockout in a transgenic tauopathy mouse model exerts protective effects on numerous physiological, behavioural and neuropathological outcome measures.

While the general reaction catalyzed by recombinases is the same in all domains, key differences at the amino acid level can lead to the specialization of this family of proteins. A key example of this is in the domain of Eukarya, which can utilize two different RecA homologs depending on the life cycle stage of the organism, with the activity of Rad51 utilized during mitotic growth and the activity of Dmc1 used during meiosis. Why most eukaryotes utilize two RecA homologs is an open question. A missing piece of information in this story is the identity of RecA homologs before the divergence of Rad51 and Dmc1, which occurred in early eukaryotes. We analyzed sequence data from the Archaeal homolog, RadA, in the Asgard Archaea superphyla. Our findings include evidence for the evolution of a eukaryotic-specific DNA binding site II within the Asgard lineage. We also identify sequence variants within DNA binding loops L1 and L2, part of binding site I, that imply higher mismatch tolerance within the Asgard and DPANN superphylum. These loops are also observed in the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 within Eukarya. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests the last Archaeal ancestor of Rad51 and Dmc1 was more Dmc1-like in character and likely of lower fidelity.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Applying network control theory to measurements of brain signals enables characterization of brain dynamics through control properties, including controllability. However, most prior studies that have applied network control theory have evaluated brain dynamics under unperturbed conditions, neglecting the critical role of external perturbations in accurate system identification, which is a fundamental principle in control theory. The incorporation of perturbation inputs is therefore essential for precise characterization of brain dynamics. In this study, we combine a perturbation input paradigm with a network control theory framework and propose a novel method for estimating the controllability Gramian matrix in a simple, theoretically grounded manner. This method provides insights into brain dynamics, including overall controllability (quantified by the Gramians eigenvalues) and specific controllable directions (represented by its eigenvectors). As a proof of concept, we applied our method to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) responses across four motor-related states and two resting states. We found that states such as open-eye rest, closed-eye rest, and motor-related states were more effectively differentiated using controllable directions than overall controllability. However, certain states, like motor execution and motor imagery, remained indistinguishable using these measures. These findings indicate that some brain states differ in their intrinsic control properties as dynamical systems, while others share similarities that make them less distinguishable. This study underscores the value of control theory-based analyses in quantitatively how intrinsic brain states shape the brains responses to stimulation, providing deeper insights into the dynamic properties of these states. This methodology holds promise for diverse applications, including characterizing individual response variability and identifying conditions for optimal stimulation efficacy.

Significant statementThe brain can be viewed as a control system transitioning between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Previous studies using network control theory mostly evaluated brain dynamics without external perturbations, neglecting their role in accurate system identification. This study integrates perturbation inputs with network control theory to propose a method for estimating the controllability Gramian, thereby providing insights into brain dynamics. We applied this approach to TMS-induced EEG responses in motor-related and resting states. Our findings show that controllable directions (eigenvectors) allow better discrimination between states than overall controllability. Our method can quantitatively assess brain state differences, and has potential applications in characterizing individual response variability and optimizing stimulation efficacy.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

We conducted a pooled-sample molecular surveillance to understand the true prevalence of Oropouche fever in Brazil's southernmost state. Over 18 months, we analyzed 4,060 samples to monitor the virus emergence in the Rio Grande do Sul state. We detected the first human case of Oropouche virus in the state, and our phylogenetic reconstruction indicated a travel-related introduction from Amazon region into Rio Grande do Sul. Despite the absence of local transmission, the invasion of Culicoides paraensis and enzootic circulation of the Oropouche virus in Rio Grande do Sul highlight the risk of Oropouche fever outbreaks in the region. We demonstrated that pooled-sample surveillance effectively monitors virus introduction during periods of low endemic circulation, serving as an essential active surveillance tool for the timely detection of virus emergence and enhancing public health preparedness.

Predicting patterns of diversity under such background selection has received considerable attention, and recent applications were able to explain a large portion of the variation in diversity across the human genome. However, current models have yielded conflicting results, stemming from two key limitations. First, they display inaccuracies in the most critical region of parameter space (Nes [~] -1), where the reduction in diversity is sharpest; second, they assume a constant population size over time. Here, we develop predictions for diversity under background selection based on the Hill-Robertson system of two-locus statistics allowing for population size changes. We treat the joint effect of multiple selected loci independently, but we show that interference among them is well captured through local rescaling of mutation, recombination and selection in an iterative procedure that converges quickly. We further accommodate existing background selection theory to population size changes, bridging the gap between weak and strong selection. Simulations show that our predictions are accurate over the entire distribution of selection coefficients. We characterize the temporal dynamics of linked selection under non equilibrium demography and demonstrate that patterns of diversity can be misinterpreted by other models. Specifically, neglecting population size changes bias predictions of diversity, which then carry over to downstream inferences of the distribution of fitness effects and deleterious mutation rate. Jointly modeling demography and linked selection therefore improves our understanding of the genomic landscape of diversity, which will help refine inferences of linked selection in humans and other species.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Reproductive isolation can be generated by different mechanisms that have been extensively characterized, yet how their interactions affect speciation remains largely unknown. Here, we explicitly model the interaction of three key mechanisms (local adaptation, mate choice and genetic hybrid incompatibilities) quantifying their relative contribution to the evolution of reproductive isolation. We modeled two populations exchanging migrants using Fisher Geometric Model for local adaptation, phenotype matching for mate choice, and multiple pairs of Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities (DMI). All three mechanisms were determined by the same set of loci, creating conditions for interactions between barriers both at the genetic and population levels. We found no cases where the three barriers evolved. Instead, two barriers could evolve depending on the migration rate: either local adaptation and genetic incompatibilities for limited migration, or local adaptation and mate choice for higher migration. Our results showed that local adaptation due to ecological differentiation was the first to evolve and by far the most effective reproductive barrier. Finally, we demonstrated that in a polygenic model, populations could become locally adapted and evolve strict mate choice, yet they would not accumulate incompatibilities provided that there was sufficient gene flow.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

This question can be tested by studying colonisation of environments with little to no pre-existing life. Here, we investigated the functional basis of microbial colonisation in the forelands of a maritime Antarctic and an alpine Swiss retreating glacier, by integrating quantitative ecology, genome-resolved metagenomics, and biogeochemical measurements. Habitat generalists and opportunists rapidly colonize both forelands and persist across soil depth and decadal chronosequences that serve as proxies for temporal community dynamics. These microbes are metabolically flexible chemotrophic aerobes that overcome oligotrophic conditions by using both organic and inorganic compounds, including atmospheric trace gases and sulfur substrates, for energy and carbon acquisition. They co-exist with metabolically flexible early-colonising opportunists and metabolically restricted later-colonising specialists, including photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, ammonia-oxidising archaea, and obligate predatory and symbiotic bacteria, that exhibit narrower habitat distributions. Analysis of 589 species-level metagenome-assembled genomes reveals early colonisation both by generalists and opportunists is strongly associated with metabolic flexibility. Field- and laboratory-based biogeochemical measurements reveal the activity of metabolically flexible microbes rapidly commenced in the forelands.

The insular cortex, known for its functional diversity, has been hypothesized to be a key convergence hub, yet empirical evidence identifying how and where convergence occurs is incomplete. To address this gap, we analyzed functional convergence across four key task domains--somatic pain, non-somatic appetitive processes, aversive processes, and cognitive control--in a large-scale Bayesian mega-analysis of fMRI data (N=540, systematically sampled from 36 studies). Bayes Factor analyses identified both convergent zones responding to multiple domains and selective zones responding to single domains. Results revealed a hierarchical convergence architecture, with a multi-domain convergence zone in bilateral dorsal anterior insula surrounded by zones showing progressively increasing convergence. Functional decoding and coactivation analyses further support the insulas role as a convergence hub, while cytoarchitectonic and neurotransmitter profiling characterizes the potential neuroanatomical underpinnings subserving convergent and domain-selective function. Overall, our results demonstrate a structured functional topography in the insula that bridges specialized and convergent processing, providing a potential neural basis for how diverse information streams combine into unified subjective experiences.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Fourteen out of the sixteen mAbs neutralized the virus in vitro. The mAbs with the strongest hemagglutination inhibition activity also demonstrated greater neutralizing capacity and showed increased protective effects in vivo when administered prophylactically or therapeutically in a murine H5N1 challenge model. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we identified a cross-clonotype conserved motif that bound a hydrophobic groove on the head domain of H5 HA.

We drew on existing knowledge of tuberculosis determinants, identified which are likely to be sensitive to the effects of climate change, and conceptualised the mechanistic pathways through which this might occur. We collated evidence for these pathways through literature reviews. Our reviews found no studies directly linking climate change and tuberculosis, warranting research to build evidence for action.

Although tangible improvements have been made in academic publishing and conference participation, gender imbalances in citations among leading neuroscience journals persist and are increasing with time. Here, we expand upon prior work by providing a more comprehensive analysis of citation practices across fifty journals to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the field as a whole, particularly across different kinds of journals. We first confirm that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than expected if gender were unrelated to citation practices. Further, we demonstrate that this effect is strongest in the most influential journals. We also find that the apparent closure of the gender gap is due to the interaction of three unique, nuanced patterns of citation: one that is characterized by relative overcitation of papers with men as both first and last author; one that is characterized by relative overcitation of women as the last author, and one that is characterized by relative undercitation of women as the first author. In addition, we find that these patterns of citation are not distributed evenly across the field: more prestigious journals tend to have articles with citation gaps favoring men, while less prestigious journals tend to overcite papers with women as last authors. We discuss potential drivers for these patterns and suggest some implications for the field moving forward.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Single-cell and spatial sequencing of samples from different developmental timepoints provide data to investigate differentiation but inferring a sequence of differentiation events requires: (1) finding trajectories, or ancestor:descendant relationships, between cells from consecutive timepoints; (2) coarse-graining these trajectories into a differentiation map, or collection of transitions between cell types, rather than individual cells. We introduce Hidden-Markov Optimal Transport (HM -OT), an algorithm that simultaneously groups cells into cell types and learns transitions between these cell types from developmental transcriptomics time series. HM -OT uses low-rank optimal transport to simultaneously align samples in a time series and learn a sequence of clusterings and a differentiation map with minimal total transport cost. We assume that the law governing cell-type trajectories is characterized by the joint law on consecutive time points, tantamount to a Markov assumption on these latent trajectories. HM -OT can learn these clusterings in a fully unsupervised manner or can generate the least-cost cell type differentiation map consistent with a given set of cell type labels. We validate the unsupervised clusters and cell type differentiation map output by HM -OT on a Stereo-seq dataset of zebrafish development, and we demonstrate the scalability of HM -OT to a massive Stereo-seq dataset of mouse embryonic development.

Calcineurin is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic A subunit and a regulatory B subunit. Through downstream effectors, calcineurin signaling drives myriad responses in different organisms. In the fungal pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex that infects humans, calcineurin governs thermotolerance and is essential for growth at high temperature and pathogenesis. In Cryptococcus deneoformans, the underlying molecular functions of this critical signaling cascade are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a genetic screen and identified genetic changes that suppress the requirement for calcineurin during high-temperature growth. Our results identified two mechanisms that bypass the requirement for calcineurin function. The first mechanism involves segmental aneuploidy via both amplification as well as loss of chromosome fragments. The second mechanism involves dominant amino acid substitution mutations in the genes encoding three proteins, Chs6, Imp2, and Cts1, which function in a complex required for septation and budding. Loss of calcineurin activity causes chitin and chitosan accumulation and severe budding defects, whereas suppressor mutations restore largely normal growth and cytokinesis in the absence of calcineurin. These findings reveal the calcineurin signaling cascade controls a conserved cytokinesis machinery at the mitotic exit network during thermal stress.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

By merging trees from several sentences, we obtain syntax graphs or networks, which display distinct shapes depending on whether the language capability is well-formed, still developing, or pathological. Such graphs make syntactic capacity quantifiable at a systemic level, revealing emerging patterns and universalities. What is the structure of syntax networks during ontogeny in typically developing (TD) children? Do cognitively challenged children develop language through alternative routes? Here we quantify and portray the typical development of syntax networks in Dutch, and find that children affected by Down syndrome, hearing impairment, and specific language impairment initially seem to follow the typical developmental path but eventually halt, culminating in a different linguistic phenotype. Our expanded data set (with almost 50 times more data than earlier studies) and increased mathematical dimensions to quantify network shape enable us to: (i) confirm and refine a proposed sharp transition in language development, (ii) correlate specific network traits with syntax maturation, and (iii) quantify the aspects that fall short in atypical development--suggesting potential diagnostic tools. We also find grounds to hypothesize a gap in syntax maturation, separating challenged children who nevertheless reach the latest stage from others systematically stuck, regardless of their condition.

DNA damage elicits a DNA damage response (DDR) that includes error-free and error-prone, i.e. mutagenic, repair. The SOS response is a widely conserved system in bacteria that regulates the DDR and depends on the recombinase RecA and the transcriptional repressor LexA. However, RecA/LexA-independent DDRs have been identified in several bacterial species. Here, using a whole-cell, label-free quantitative proteomics approach, we map the proteomic response in Myxococcus xanthus to mitomycin C treatment and the lack of LexA. In doing so, we confirm a LexA-independent DDR in M. xanthus. Using a candidate approach, we identify DdiA, a transcriptional regulator of the XRE family, and demonstrate that it regulates a subset of the LexA-independent DDR genes. ddiA is expressed heterogeneously in a subpopulation of cells in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress and reversibly induced population-wide in response to such stress. DdiA, indirectly or directly, activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Accordingly, the {Delta}ddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, suggesting that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis. We speculate that the DdiA-dependent response is tailored to counter replication stress, thereby preventing the induction of the complete RecA/LexA-dependent DDR in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress.

ImportanceDNA damage repair is essential for genome integrity and depends on the DNA damage response (DDR). While the RecA/LexA-dependent SOS response is widely conserved in bacteria, there are also RecA/LexA-independent DDRs. Here, we identify the DNA damage-induced transcriptional regulator DdiA in Myxococcus xanthus and demonstrate that it regulates part of the RecA/LexA-independent DDR. DdiA activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Because the {Delta}ddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, we suggest that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis and that the DdiA-dependent DDR is specifically tailored to counter replication stress.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

For astrocytes to serve such purposes, the interactions with synapses in neuronal circuits require a level of specificity beyond overall synaptic support. A systematic mapping of the astrocyte-connectome relationship would enable the testing of these hypotheses - such analysis is however still lacking, in particular for circuits in the cerebral cortex. Here, utilizing previously published connectomic data of more than 200,000 synapses, we systematically analyzed the spatial relation between astrocytes and synapses in mouse somatosensory cortex. We developed a quantitative assessment of astrocyte-synapse proximity, finding that only 22.7% of synapses are contacted by astrocytic processes for more than 50% of their synaptic circumference. This non-ubiquitous astrocytic attachment would render astrocyte-synapse specificity plausible. Astrocytic coverage depended strongly on synapse types, with thalamocortical shaft synapses being the most covered by astrocytic processes. We furthermore observed a strong dependence of astrocytic synaptic coverage on synapse size, which was exclusive for excitatory spine synapses. We then investigated the possible relation of astrocytic synaptic coverage to neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, finding ultrastructural evidence for substantially reduced astrocytic support at synapses consistent with long-term depression, but not for astrocytic coverage dependence on baseline neuronal presynaptic activity. Together, our data demonstrate a high level of specificity of astrocyte-synapse interactions for particular synaptic types. They indicate the potential relevance of astrocytic coverage for synapse stability, in particular for large synapses, suggesting a contribution to long-term maintenance of learned synaptic states. These methods will allow a systematic testing of hypotheses about glial-neuronal interaction in various brain regions, disease models and species including human.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

This poses a fundamental computational challenge: optimally binding signals sharing the same communicative intention (e.g. looking at the addressee while speaking) and segregating unrelated signals (e.g. looking away while coughing), all within the rapid turn-taking dynamics of conversation. Critically, the computational mechanisms underlying this extraordinary feat remain largely unknown. Here, we cast face-to-face communication as a Bayesian Causal Inference problem to formally test whether prior expectations arbitrate between the integration and segregation of vocal and bodily signals. Moreover, we asked whether there is a stronger prior tendency to integrate audiovisual signals that show the same communicative intention, thus carrying a crossmodal pragmatic correspondence. In a spatial localization task, participants watched audiovisual clips of a speaker where the audio (voice) and the video (bodily cues) were sampled either from congruent positions or at increasing spatial disparities. Crucially, we manipulated the pragmatic correspondence of the signals: in a communicative condition, the speaker addressed the participant with their head, gaze and speech; in a non-communicative condition, the speaker kept the head down and produced a meaningless vocalization. We measured audiovisual integration through the ventriloquist effect, which quantifies how much the perceived audio position is misplaced towards the video position. Bayesian Causal Inference outperformed competing models in explaining participants behaviour, demonstrating that prior expectations guide multisensory integration during face-to-face communication. Remarkably, participants showed a stronger prior tendency to integrate vocal and bodily information when signals conveyed congruent communicative intent, suggesting that pragmatic correspondences enhance multisensory integration. Collectively, our findings provide novel and compelling evidence that face-to-face communication is shaped by deeply ingrained expectations about how multisensory signals should be structured and interpreted.

Author summaryFace-to-face communication is complex: what we say is coupled with bodily signals, offset in time, which may or may not work in concert to convey meaning. Yet, the brain rapidly determines which multisensory signals belong together and which, instead, must be kept apart, suggesting that prior expectations play a crucial role in this decision-making process. Here, we directly tested this hypothesis using Bayesian computational modelling, which allows for isolating the contribution of prior expectations and sensory uncertainty on the final perceptual decision. We found that people have a stronger prior tendency to combine vocal and bodily signals when they convey the same communicative intent (i.e. the speaker addresses the observer concurrently with their head, gaze and speech) relative to when this correspondence is absent. Thus, the brain uses prior expectations to bind multisensory signals that carry converging communicative meaning. These findings provide key insight into the sophisticated mechanisms underpinning efficient multimodal communication.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Thus, we reveal that two previously undefined proteins form a key module for organizing and stabilizing the distal tip of motile cilia in vertebrate MCC. We propose that these proteins represent potential disease loci for motile ciliopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Studies have often equated the effects of knocking down one synthase with broader SAM-dependent outcomes such as histone methylation or phosphatidylcholine (PC) production. Humans and many other organisms express multiple SAM synthases. Evidence in Caenorhabditis elegans, which possesses four SAM synthase genes, suggest that the enzymatic source of SAM impacts its function. For instance, loss of sams-1 leads to enhanced heat shock survival and increased lifespan, whereas reducing sams-4 adversely affects heat stress survival. Here, we show that SAMS-1 contributes to a variety of intermediary metabolic pathways, whereas SAMS-4 is more important to generate SAM for methylation reactions. We demonstrate that loss of sams-1 exerts age-dependent effects on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression, mitochondrial metabolites, and may induce mitophagy. We propose a mechanistic model where reduced SAM from SAMS-1 acts through PC to impact mitochondria, thereby enhancing survival during heat stress.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

While underlying mechanisms remain elusive, immune factors and lifestyle components, such as diet and physical activity, could play a role in shaping disease outcomes. Since Th cells are key drivers of RA, this study characterised CD4 Th subset frequencies, including Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th1/17 cells, in a cohort of males and females with established RA. Considering the role of diet and lifestyle in RA development, we also evaluated participant diet and lifestyle patterns. Methods: An observational cross-sectional cohort study profiling 39 individuals (19 RA and 20 age and sex matched controls) with no major co-morbidities was conducted. Percentages of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th1/17 cells from peripheral blood were determined by flow cytometry as well as serum levels of RF and cytokines IL17a, IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, GM-CSF, TGF-{beta}, IL-6, and CRP by ELISA. Dietary intake was assessed by Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), the Dietary inflammatory Index (DII) calculated from nutrient intake. Physical activity levels were evaluated by Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). Results: Sex-specific differences of Th17, Th1 an Th2 cells were observed in RA groups. Males had lower levels of Th1 cells and higher levels of Th17 cells than control subjects, while females had lower levels of Th2 cells than controls. Female RA subjects had higher ratio of Th1:Th2 cells than controls, while male RA subjects had higher Th17:Th1 ratio than controls. Interestingly, circulating CD4 Th subset levels were predictive of RA in this cohort. No changes in cytokine levels were observed. The male RA group consumed 30% less carbohydrate (RA = 156g +/- 57g, Control = 253g +/- 59g; p=0.003), 37% less sugar (RA = 74.1g +/- 29g, Control = 118g +/-33g; p=0.004) and 30% less dietary fibre (R = 33g +/- 8g, Control = 48g +/- 13 g; p=0.008) than the male control group. The female RA group had the lowest consumption of alcohol in comparison to female control group (RA = 0.31g, Control = 8.97g; p=0.047). Male subjects had a 4x higher DII than females (p=0.012). Conclusions: Our findings highlight potential sex-specific differences in CD4+ Th cell subsets in individuals with established RA, indicating that sex may influence immune cell composition in this disease. Furthermore, dietary components showed sex-specific consumption patterns, underscoring the potential role of tailored lifestyle interventions in modulating immune responses in RA. Evaluating immunological sex differences and dietary and lifestyle factors may be important for enhancing management strategies in RA.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Although they are routinely used for studying evolutionary histories and assessing new assemblies, current methods do not incorporate information from available genomic data. Here, we first determine the influence of evolutionary history on universal gene content in plants, fungi and animals. We find that across 11,098 genomes comprising 2,606 taxonomic groups, 215 groups significantly vary from their respective lineages in terms of their BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs) completeness. Additionally, 169 groups display an elevated complement of duplicated orthologs, likely as an artifact of whole genome duplication events. Secondly, we investigate the extent of taxonomic congruence in BUSCO-derived whole-genome phylogenies. For 275 suitable families out of 543 tested, sites evolving at higher rates produce at most 23.84% more taxonomically concordant, and at least 46.15% less terminally variable phylogenies compared to lower-rate sites. We find topological differences between BUSCO concatenated and coalescent trees to be marginal and conclude that higher rate sites from concatenated alignments produce the most congruent and least variable phylogenies. Finally, we show that BUSCO misannotations can lead to misrepresentations of assembly quality. To overcome this issue, we filter a Curated set of BUSCOs (CUSCOs) that provide up to 6.99% fewer false positives compared to the standard BUSCO search and introduce novel methods for comparing assemblies using BUSCO synteny. Overall, we highlight the importance of considering evolutionary histories during assembly evaluations and release the phyca software toolkit that reconstructs consistent phylogenies and reports phylogenetically informed assembly assessments.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

We introduce SAGE-net, a scalable framework and software package for training and evaluating S2F models using personal genomes. Leveraging its scalability, we conduct extensive experiments on model and training hyperparameters, demonstrating that training on personal genomes improves predictions for held-out individuals. However, the model achieves this by identifying predictive variants rather than learning a cis-regulatory grammar that generalizes across loci. This failure to generalize persists across a range of hyperparameter settings. These findings highlight the need for further exploration to unlock the full potential of S2F models in decoding the regulatory grammar of personal genomes. Scalable software and infrastructure development will be critical to this progress.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

However, its utility in severe infection remains poorly understood. Here, we isolated cfDNA from sepsis patients and controls, demonstrating a 41-fold increase in the amount of cfDNA in circulation during disease. We used sequencing to reconstruct cfDNA methylomes, fragmentation profiles, and nucleosome footprints across 56 samples. We observed no difference in cfDNA composition between patients and controls, challenging the idea that cfDNA increases due to higher immune cell death during sepsis. Instead, we suggest that liver dysfunction prevents efficient clearance of cfDNA during disease. This was supported by fragmentation and end-motif patterns, both of which showed evidence of cfDNA being exposed to circulating nucleases for a prolonged period, proportionally to the extent of liver dysfunction. Variation in cfDNA of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor origin was also a significant contributor in sepsis, increasing over time. Moreover, we showed that cfDNA retains nucleosome footprints with cell type-specific gene activity information. We developed a novel approach to study nucleosome phasing that successfully recovers tissue-specific signatures. By combining this with single-cell data, we demonstrated that sepsis patients with liver dysfunction have higher amounts of cfDNA derived from Kupffer cells and the liver parenchyma. In conclusion, we present the first high-throughput multi-modal study of cfDNA during sepsis, which will serve as a reference point for future studies on the role of this biomarker in critical illness.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

MULTI-ATAC provides high accuracy in sample classification and doublet detection while eliminating batch effects associated with variable nucleus-to-Tn5 ratio. We illustrate the power of MULTI-ATAC by performing a 96-plex multiomic drug assay targeting epigenetic remodelers in a model of primary immune cell activation, uncovering tens of thousands of drug-responsive chromatin regions, cell-type specific effects, and potent differences between matched inhibitors and degraders. MULTI-ATAC therefore enables batch-free and scalable scATAC-seq workflows, providing deeper insights into complex biological processes and potential therapeutic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

How different immune cell types engage PRR- and guard protein-dependent defenses in response to infection is poorly understood. Here, we show that macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) respond in distinct ways to bacterial virulence activities. In macrophages, the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila deploys its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to deliver effector proteins that facilitate its robust intracellular replication. In contrast, T4SS activity triggers rapid DC death that potently restricts Legionella replication within this cell type. Intriguingly, we found that infected DCs exhibit considerable heterogeneity at the single cell level. Initially, a subset of DCs activate caspase-11 and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis and release IL-1{beta} early during infection. At later timepoints, a separate DC population undergoes apoptosis driven by T4SS effectors that block host protein synthesis, thereby depleting the levels of the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1 and cFLIP. Together, pyroptosis and effector-triggered apoptosis robustly restrict Legionella replication in DCs. Collectively, our work suggests a model where Mcl-1 and cFLIP guard host translation in DCs, and that macrophages and DCs distinctly employ innate immune sensors and guard proteins to mount divergent responses to Legionella infection.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

The cytochrome (Cyt) b6/f complex plays a pivotal role in regulating electron flow and ensuring PSI stability under fluctuating light. However, its precise role in balancing PSI protection and photosynthetic capacity remains unclear. In this study, transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. W38) with reduced Cyt b6/f content was used to examine PSI tolerance to photoinhibition and photosynthetic performance under fluctuating light. Notably, the reduced Cyt b6/f content conferred significant protection of PSI against photoinhibition induced by fluctuating light, albeit at the expense of the electron transport capacity. Remarkably, PSI stability was maintained even under extreme fluctuating light conditions in the plants with lowest Cyt b6/f contents, highlighting a trade-off between photoprotection and photosynthetic capacity. These findings reveal that a reduction in Cyt b6/f content enhances PSI protection while adjusting electron transport capacity, making plants more adaptable in environments dominated by low light and transient sunflecks. This study provides new insights into the adaptive strategies of plants under dynamic light environments and underscores the potential of targeting Cyt b6/f for enhancing crop tolerance to fluctuating light conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

A fundamental unresolved question is whether and how T cell exhaustion is determined at the onset of TCR signaling6-8. Here we report an unexpected role of Themis, a TCR-proximal signaling molecule9, in T cell exhaustion. Chronic viral infection in mice usually leads to T cell exhaustion and survival of the host. Surprisingly, Themis T-cell conditional knockout mice died from severe CD8+-dependent lung immunopathology in chronic viral infection, showing Themis importance in establishing T cell exhaustion. We found that Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells were hyperactivated at the single-cell level - producing more TNF and IFN{gamma} compared to wild-type counterparts - but defective in population-level expansion. Moreover, TCF-1 and TOX expression were inhibited in Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells, thereby impairing differentiation of exhausted T cell precursors (T-pex) and maintenance of terminally exhausted T cells (T-ex), respectively. Mechanistically, Themis initially promotes TCR signaling to induce PD-1 expression and subsequently mediates PD-1 signaling. In the latter, Themis binds to PD-1 and promotes PD-1 phosphorylation and its recruitment of SHP2, thereby acting as a negative regulator to inhibit T cell effector functions. Without Themis, the orderly regulation of TCR and PD-1 signaling, and therefore exhaustion, is disrupted. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that Themis-mediated early TCR signaling plays a decisive role in T cell exhaustion and provide a novel mechanism of PD-1 signaling through Themis.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

In general practice in England up to one-in-two nursing posts are predicted to be unfilled by 2030/31, with Wales similarly threatened. This is reflected internationally. Limited attention has been paid to how cultural and structural issues affect retention of nurses in general practice. The aim of our study is to understand factors that challenge retention and support nurses to stay in general practice.

MethodsWe conducted an exploratory qualitative interview study with n=41 with members of nursing teams working in, or who have worked in, general practice as well as nurse leaders associated with general practice across England and Wales. Recruitment was through professional and social media networks and snowballing techniques. Data were collected between October 2023-June 2024 and analysed following framework analysis. University of York ethics approval (Ref: HSRGC/2023/586/A) was gained. The study was funded by the General Nursing Council Trust.

ResultsRecognition of value of nurses working in general practice was central to the retention of nurses at all levels of practice and was affected by structural and cultural issues and reflected in several themes: The essence of nursing in general practice; The commodification and deprofessionalisation of nursing in general practice; Opportunities for development; Employment of nurses outside of the National Health Service; Lack of voice, precarity of position and lack of recourse; Tipping points.

ConclusionCultural and structural issues impacted on retention of nurses in general practice. While some supported retention, others revealed deep-seated, complex issues which require addressing at practice, local and national organisational levels. Nurses in general practice experience factors which leave them vulnerable and underserved.

However, the inherent complexity of proteomics data and the scarcity of phenotypic labels, particularly for rare diseases, pose significant challenges in modeling proteome-phenome relationships. Utilizing proteomics data from 2,924 plasma proteins measured in 53,014 UK Biobank participants, we introduce Prophet, an interpretable deep learning framework that combines transformer architecture with a multistage, multitask training strategy to improve disease prediction and biological discovery from personal proteomic profiles. Prophet begins with self-supervised pretraining to model protein interactions, followed by prompt-based fine-tuning for disease diagnosis, and concludes with continuous fine-tuning for disease prediction. Extensive benchmarking across more than 100 diseases demonstrates Prophet's superior performance over multiple baseline methods, achieving the highest increase in the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 132.71% for disease diagnosis and 60.29% for disease prediction. Specifically, Prophet enhances diagnostic accuracy for 95.83% of diseases and boosts predictive accuracy for 94.02% of diseases. Through model interpretation, Prophet identifies 21,549 and 25,915 protein-disease associations for prevalent and incident diseases, respectively, and uncovers prevailing proteomics-based similarities among diseases. Our work provides a powerful framework for proteomics-based disease diagnosis, prediction, and biomarker discovery.","NA","medrxiv",1740262086482

To elucidate which gene(s) are responsible for the 1q21.1 duplication/deletion-associated phenotypes, we performed gene manipulation in zebrafish and mice. We modeled 1q21.1 duplication by overexpressing the eight human protein-coding genes in zebrafish. We found that overexpression of CHD1L only led to macrocephaly and increased larval body length, whereas chd1l deletion caused opposite phenotypes. These mirrored phenotypes were also observed in mouse embryos. Transcriptomic, cistromic, and chromatin accessibility analyses of CHD1L knock-out hiPSC-derived neuronal progenitor cells revealed that CHD1L regulates the expression levels and chromatin accessibility of genes involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis, including autism genes. Moreover, we found that CHD1L favors telencephalon development during forebrain regionalization by facilitating chromatin accessibility to pioneer transcription factors including SOX2 and OTX2 while simultaneously compacting chromatin through its interaction with the repressor NuRD complex. Last, atypical 1q21.1 CNV encompassing CHD1L and pathogenic missense and truncating CHD1L variants were found in individuals with autism. Overall, our data reveal a novel role for CHD1L as a master regulator of cell fate and its dosage imbalance contributes to the neuroanatomical and growth phenotypes associated with the 1q21.1 distal CNV.

We sought to investigate brain delivery and efficacy of Aducanumab (Adu), an anti-A{beta} antibody, when fused to a mouse TfR1-binding Fab fragment as BBB shuttle (TfR1-Adu). Automated 3D light sheet fluorescence imaging coupled with computational analysis was applied to evaluate drug IgG distribution and plaque counts throughout the intact brain of transgenic APP/PS1 mice. TfR1-Adu demonstrated enhanced brain delivery and more homogeneous distribution after both acute and chronic dosing in transgenic APP/PS1 mice compared with unmodified Adu. Also, importantly, only unmodified Adu showed perivascular labelling. While high-dose Adu promoted A{beta} plaque depletion in multiple brain regions, similar plaque-clearing efficacy was achieved with a five-fold lower dose of TfR1-Adu. Furthermore, low-dose TfR1-Adu demonstrated greater capacity to reduce congophilic plaque burden. Collectively, these observations strongly support the applicability of TfR1-enabled BBB shuttle strategies to improve brain delivery and plaque-clearing efficacy while mitigating the risk of vascular-associated amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) adverse effects associated with current A{beta} immunotherapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

These structural differences may reflect evolutionary changes in the developmental expression of shared genes. To investigate this possibility, we compared cell-type-specific gene expression across species in the developing mouse and human neocortex, and human cortical organoids, by generating a shared transcriptional reference framework. This identified genes with conserved/divergent expression patterns, providing a molecular foundation to interrogate species-specific cellular properties. Using this resource, we discovered that the transcription factor JUNB is expressed in human but not mouse progenitors. Through cell-type-specific gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mice and human organoids, we demonstrate that JUNB bidirectionally controls human cortical features, including progenitor proliferation rates, neuronal production timing, and total neuronal output. This reveals how cell-type-specific regulation of shared genes during development can drive species-specific cortical features, providing a framework for understanding the molecular basis of cortical evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Here we describe a system, which we term SOS splicing, that protects C. elegans and human genes from DNA transposon-mediated disruption by excising these TEs from host mRNAs. SOS splicing, which operates independently of the spliceosome, is a pattern recognition system triggered by base-pairing of inverted terminal repeat elements, which are a defining feature of the DNA transposons. We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human cells; AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges RTCB and AKAP17A, allowing RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision. We propose that SOS splicing is a novel, conserved, and RNA structure-directed mode of mRNA splicing and that one function of SOS splicing is to genetically buffer animals from the deleterious effects of TE-mediated gene perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

The established protocols for single cells grown on or deposited on EM-grids are not suitable for multicellular plant tissues. Plunge-freezing does not yield vitrified samples in most cases and must be replaced by high-pressure freezing. This, in turn, necessitates extensive modifications of the subsequent FIB milling procedures. In this communication we describe procedures for sample screening, targeted FIB milling guided by cryo-fluorescence microscopy and a novel lamella trimming step that allows to obtain homogenously thin lamellae suitable for cryo-ET. We have tested all the steps along the workflow with a variety of plant tissues including the moss Physcomitrium patens and tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana and Limonium bicolor.

However, prioritizing causal common and rare non-coding variants in human disease, and understanding how selective pressures have shaped the non-coding genome, remains a significant challenge. Here, we predicted the effects of 15 million variants with deep learning models trained on single-cell ATAC-seq across 132 cellular contexts in adult and fetal brain and heart, producing nearly two billion context-specific predictions. Using these predictions, we distinguish candidate causal variants underlying human traits and diseases and their context-specific effects. While common variant effects are more cell-type-specific, rare variants exert more cell-type-shared regulatory effects, with selective pressures particularly targeting variants affecting fetal brain neurons. To prioritize de novo mutations with extreme regulatory effects, we developed FLARE, a context-specific functional genomic model of constraint. FLARE outperformed other methods in prioritizing case mutations from autism-affected families near syndromic autism-associated genes; for example, identifying mutation outliers near CNTNAP2 that would be missed by alternative approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating single-cell maps with population genetics and deep learning-based variant effect prediction to elucidate mechanisms of development and disease-ultimately, supporting the notion that genetic contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders are predominantly rare.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

In this study, we integrated single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate an atlas of cell types and expression domains during the early stages of wheat spike development. We characterized spatiotemporal expression of 99 genes by smFISH in 48,225 cells at the early transition (W1.5), late double ridge (W2.5) and lemma primordia (W3.25) stages. These cells were clustered into 21 different expression domains, including four beneath the developing spikelets and three different meristematic regions, which were consistent across spikelets and sections. We also identified genes differentially expressed during the transition of the inflorescence meristem into a terminal spikelet. The smFISH study was complemented by the scRNA-seq profiling of 26,009 cells from W2.5 and W3.25 that were clustered into 23 distinct cell types. We annotated the single-cell clusters as meristem, boundary domains, cortex, central spike, epidermis, and vasculature by using known markers, co-expression analysis of genes selected from the smFISH study, and correlation matrices of clusters identified in both studies. The scRNA-seq data uncovered genes associated with boundary genes TCP24 and FZP, as well as the meristematic genes AGL6 and ULT1.

Our NR5A2 CUT&Tag analysis identifies lineage-determining factor KLF and GATA families as co-regulators for NR5A2 in mouse embryos. We find that KLF5 cooperates with NR5A2 to enhance H3K27ac deposition, and NR5A2 predominantly promotes chromatin accessibility. NR5A2 regulates Xist expression either directly or indirectly through its role in up-regulating GATA factor expression. In vitro assays reveal that NR5A2 co-binds to nucleosomes with KLF5 and GATA6, suggesting that these pioneer transcription factors can simultaneously bind to the chromatin.

The spatial organization of cell surface proteins is central to these processes. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy and proximity labeling have advanced studies of surface protein associations, but the spatial organization of the complete surface proteome remains uncharted. In this study, we systematically mapped the surface proteome of human T-lymphocytes and B-lymphoblasts using proximity labeling of 85 antigens, identified from over 100 antibodies tested for binding to surface-exposed proteins. These experiments were coupled with an optimized data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry workflow to generate a robust dataset. Unsupervised clustering of the resulting interactome revealed functional modules, including well-characterized complexes such as the T-cell receptor and HLA class I/II, alongside novel clusters. Notably, we identified mitochondrial proteins localized to the surface, including the transcription factor TFAM, suggesting previously unappreciated roles for mitochondrial proteins at the plasma membrane. A high-accuracy machine learning classifier predicted over 6,000 surface protein associations, highlighting functional associations such as IL10RBs role as a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling.

These independent studies often include overlapping data, presenting a unique opportunity to build macrophylogenies (phylogenies sampling > 1,000 taxa) for entire classes across the Tree of Life. However, the inference of large trees remains constrained by logistical, computational, and methodological challenges. The Avian Tree of Life provides an ideal model for evaluating strategies to robustly infer macrophylogenies from intersecting datasets derived from smaller studies. In this study, we leveraged a comprehensive resource of sequence capture datasets to evaluate the phylogenetic accuracy and computational costs of four methodological approaches: (1) supermatrix approaches using concatenation, including the ""fast"" maximum likelihood (ML) methods, (2) filtering datasets to reduce heterogeneity, (3) supertree estimation based on published phylogenomic trees, and (4) a ""divide-and-conquer"" strategy, wherein smaller ML trees were estimated and subsequently combined using a supertree approach. Additionally, we examined the impact of these methods on divergence time estimation using a dataset that includes newly vetted fossil calibrations for the Avian Tree of Life. Our findings highlight that recently developed fast tree search approaches offer a reasonable compromise between computational efficiency and phylogenetic accuracy, facilitating inference of macrophylogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Australias geographic isolation, strict biosecurity measures and native dingo populations present a unique model for understanding the spread and evolution of canine viruses. However, aside from a few well-characterised pathogens, genomic data are scarce for many common dog viruses, limiting our understanding of their evolution and disease ecology. Using a metatranscriptomic approach we identified the viruses in dogs and dingoes from various geographical locations across mainland Australia and sample types, revealing 86 vertebrate-associated viruses belonging to 16 distinct species, including a new vesivirus-like species. Many of the viruses identified here have not previously been sequenced in Australia. We identified important dog pathogens associated with canine infectious respiratory disease syndrome--such as canine pneumovirus, canine herpesvirus, and canine respiratory coronavirus--and gastroenteritis, including canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and rotavirus A. The sequences of Australian canine viruses often occupied multiple distinct clades phylogenetically and had little geographic structure, suggesting multiple virus introductions and subsequent spread across the country. Notably, we identified the first RNA virus - rotavirus A - in a dingo. This virus was phylogenetically distinct from dog-associated rotavirus A sequences and more closely related to viruses found in humans and bats, indicative of the past cross-species transmission of a reassortant virus into dingoes, and shows dingoes and domestic dogs may have distinct viromes. Our findings expand the knowledge of viral diversity in Australian canines, improving our understanding of viral movement into and within Australia, as well as the potential zoonotic risks associated with dogs and dingoes.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Spatiotemporal information on the contribution of distinct bone marrow niche populations to this process is incomplete. We demonstrate that fibrosis-inducing hematopoietic cells cause profibrotic reprogramming of perivascular CXCL12 abundant reticular (CAR) progenitor cells resulting in loss of their hematopoiesis-support and upregulation of osteogenic and pro-apoptotic programs. In turn, peritrabecular osteolineage cells (OLCs) are activated in an injury-specific, Wnt-dependent manner, comparable to skeletal repair. OLCs fuel bone marrow fibrosis through their expansion and skewed differentiation, resulting in osteosclerosis and expansion of Ly6a+ fibroblasts. NCAM1 expression marks peritrabecular OLCs and their expansion into the central marrow is specific for fibrosis in mice and patients. Peritrabecular stromal b-catenin expression is linked to fibrosis in patients and inhibition of Wnt signaling reduces bone marrow fibrosis and osteosclerosis, possibly being a clinically relevant therapeutic target.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Accurately identifying regions that are spatially coherent in both gene expression and physical tissue structures is an emerging topic, but challenging due to the lack of ground truth labels which renders complicating validation of clustering consistency and reproducibility. This highlights a need for a computational evaluation framework to rigorously and unbiasedly assess clustering performance.

ResultsTo address this gap, we propose STEAM (Spatial Transcriptomics Evaluation Algorithm and Metric), a user-friendly computational pipeline designed to evaluate the consistency and reliability of clustering results by leveraging machine learning classification and prediction methods, with the goal of maintaining the spatial proximity and gene expression patterns within clusters. We benchmarked STEAM on various public datasets, spanning multi-cell to single-cell resolution, as well as spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. The results highlighted its robustness and generalizability through comprehensive statistical evaluation metrics, such as Kappa score, F1 score, accuracy, and adjusted rand index. Notably, STEAM supports multi-sample training, enabling cross-replicate clustering consistency assessment. Moreover, STEAM provides practical guidance by comparing clustering results across multiple approaches; here, we evaluated four different methods, including spatial-aware and spatial-ignorant approaches. In summary, we believe that STEAM provides researchers a promising tool for evaluating clustering robustness and benchmarking clustering performance for spatial omics data, offering valuable insights to drive reproducible discoveries in spatial biology.

Several mechanisms that suppress multipolar division have been uncovered, yet mechanisms that favor viable multipolar division are poorly understood. To uncover factors that promote viability in cells with frequent centrosome amplification and multipolar division, we conducted an unbiased Drosophila genetic screen. In 642 mutagenized lines, we exploited the ability of intestinal papillar cells to form and function despite multipolar divisions. Our top hit is an unnamed gene, CG3168. We name this gene synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2, reflecting homology to human Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2 (SV2) proteins. GFP-tagged SV2 localizes to the plasma membrane. In cells with amplified centrosomes, SV2 positions membrane-adjacent centrosomes, which prevents severe errors in chromosome alignment and segregation.

However, most underlying gene discovery efforts have focused on individuals of European ancestry, limiting insights into genetic risks across diverse populations. To help address this, the Genomics of Autism in Latin American Ancestries Consortium (GALA) was formed, presenting here the largest sequencing study of ASD in Latin American individuals (n>15,000). We identified 35 genome-wide significant (FDR < 0.05) ASD risk genes, with substantial overlap with findings from European cohorts, and highly constrained genes showing consistent signal across populations. The results provide support for emerging (e.g., MARK2, YWHAG, PACS1, RERE, SPEN, GSE1, GLS, TNPO3, ANKRD17) and established ASD genes, and for the utility of genetic testing approaches for deleterious variants in diverse populations, while also demonstrating the ongoing need for more inclusive genetic research and testing. We conclude that the biology of ASD is universal and not impacted to any detectable degree by ancestry.

Humans can also transmit viral infections back to domestic and wild animals, which can then act as reservoir for the maintenance of viruses, with the risk of epidemic diseases re-emergence. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the COVID-19, likely originated from wildlife and has already been evidenced to be transmitted from humans to captive, domestic and wild animals. In particular, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) show high-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following human contamination, and recent data suggest that white-tailed deer could act as an emerging virus reservoir. Here, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 could also have emerged in several longitudinally-monitored populations of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in direct contact with humans in France. We performed indirect tests (serological ELISAs and seroneutralization) on serum collected pre- and post-emergence of the virus in human populations. We also performed direct tests (nasal swabs followed by RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those populations in 2022. We also investigated the exposure and prevalence of the virus in three other cervid species in France. ELISA tests were positive for 2.20 % of the sera tested, both pre- and post-emergence of the virus, but all positive samples were negative with seroneutralization. Direct PCR testing showed no positive results in 2022. Thus, although seroprevalence increased after the COVID-19 emergence (2022) in one out of three roe deer population, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has not emerged in those populations, and that ELISA cross-reaction with another circulating virus, possibly an unidentified bovine coronavirus, is possible.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

By integrating single-cell RNA-seq, single-nucleus ATAC-seq and single-nucleus multiome (joint RNA and ATAC profiling) datasets generated by the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP)2,3 we identified two previously undescribed cell populations (c11 and c13 cells), which together represent transitional states between alpha- and beta-cells. Some c11 cells are insulin-positive while others are glucagon positive, but none are double-positive. C11 cells repress alpha-cell identity genes and activate beta-cell specific genes. Moreover, the transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles of c11 and c13 cells indicate a transitioning phenotype driven by lineage-specific transcription factors. Genetic lineage tracing in primary human islet cells confirmed alpha-to-beta cell transdifferentiation. C11 and c13 cells exist in all islet samples regardless of disease statuses, with type 2 diabetic samples having significantly more transitioning cells than matched non-diabetic controls.

Yet our understanding of value-based decision-making comes primarily from studying individuals in isolation, leaving open fundamental questions about how animals adapt their strategies during social competition. Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game, in which freely-moving mice make value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrate real-time spatial information about  self and the opponent to flexibly shift their preference towards safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice and reinforcement learning agents reveal that these behavioural adaptations cannot be explained by simple reward learning, but are instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of neural activity, we found that in addition to opponent effects, decisions under competition were also noisier and more sensitive to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for neural recordings and perturbations. Together, this work reveals a fundamental mechanism for competitive foraging, and proposes novel quantitative frameworks towards understanding value-based decision-making in a fast-changing social environment.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

The expression of conserved bilaterian patterning genes in echinoderms provides a molecular framework for resolving this puzzle. Recent studies in juvenile asteroids suggest that the bilaterian antero-posterior axis maps onto the medio-lateral axis that is perpendicular to each of the five rays of the pentaradial body plan. Here we test this hypothesis in another echinoderm class, the ophiuroids, using the cosmopolitan brittle star Amphipholis squamata. Our results show that the general principles of axial patterning are similar to those described in asteroids, and comparisons with existing molecular data from other echinoderm taxa support the idea that medio-lateral deployment of the AP patterning program across the rays predates the evolution of the asterozoan and likely the echinoderm crown-groups. Our data also reveal expression differences between A. squamata and asteroids, which we attribute to secondary modifications specific to ophiuroids.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrx6 belongs to the Pet20-domain-containing protein family, consisting of Mrx6, Pet20, and Sue1. Notably, absence of Mrx6 leads to increased mtDNA copy number. Here, we identify the C-terminus of Mrx6 as essential for its stability and interaction with the mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33. Deletion of Mam33 mimics the effect of Mrx6 loss, resulting in elevated mtDNA copy number. Bioinformatics, mutational analyses, and immunoprecipitation studies reveal that a subcomplex of Mam33 and Mrx6 trimers interacts with the substrate recognition domain of the conserved mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1 through a bipartite motif in the Pet20 domain of Mrx6. Loss of Mrx6, its paralog Pet20, Mam33, or mutations disrupting the interaction between Mrx6 and Pim1 stabilize key proteins required for mtDNA maintenance, the RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the HMG-box-containing protein Cim1. We propose that Mrx6, alongside Pet20 and Mam33, regulates mtDNA copy number by modulating substrate degradation through Pim1. Additionally, Mrx6 loss alters Cim1s function, preventing the detrimental effect on mtDNA maintenance observed upon Cim1 overexpression. The presence of three Pet20-domain proteins in yeast implies broader roles of Lon protease substrate recognition beyond mtDNA regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Here, to explore hyperparasitism in Archaea, we focused on ultra-small archaea of the phylum Nanohaloarchaeota, a distinct lineage within the DPANN superphylum, which establish obligate symbiotic interactions with extreme halophiles of the class Halobacteria. We assembled five metagenomes originating from geothermally influenced salt lakes in the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, and reconstructed the viromes associated with both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea. Both archaeal lineages were associated with viruses from four distinct groups, including head-tailed viruses (class Caudoviricetes), tailless icosahedral viruses, pleomorphic viruses and spindle-shaped viruses, which represent 12 previously undescribed families. The haloarchaeal viruses (HVs) and nanohaloarchaeal viruses (NHVs) are only distantly related, suggesting that viruses from the four groups co-evolved with their respective hosts for an extended period, likely since the divergence of the two archaeal lineages from their last common ancestor. Consistently, our results show that HVs and NHVs are well-adapted to replicate in their respective hosts and to thrive in hypersaline environments. No evidence of host switching between haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea was obtained, but multiple horizontal transfers of genes implicated in virion structure and morphogenesis between HVs and NHVs were detected. We also identified several NHVs-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes implicated in nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms, which could enhance the metabolic capabilities of the nanohaloarchaeal hosts that have highly reduced genomes. Finally, in addition to HVs and NHVs, we describe plasmid-derived virus satellites that appear to have originated convergently to parasitize spindle-shaped viruses of both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea, uncovering an additional layer of parasitism. Collectively, our findings fill the knowledge gap on the diversity of HVs and NHVs, highlight the complexity of virus-host and virus-virus interactions in hypersaline environments, and open doors for further mining of the virosphere of the globally distributed DPANN archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Currently, drugs and drug candidates against AR target the steroid-binding domain to antagonize or degrade AR. However, these compounds cannot therapeutically access largely intrinsically disordered truncated splice variants of AR, such as AR-V7, that only possess the DNA binding domain and are missing the ligand binding domain. Targeting intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors has remained challenging and is considered ""undruggable"". Herein, we leveraged a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand library in a cellular screen to identify degraders of AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We identified a covalent compound EN1441 that selectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in a proteasome-dependent manner through direct covalent targeting of an intrinsically disordered cysteine C125 in AR and AR-V7. EN1441 causes significant and selective destabilization of AR and AR-V7, leading to aggregation of AR/AR-V7 and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent with targeting both AR and AR-V7, we find that EN1441 completely inhibits total AR transcriptional activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells expressing both AR and AR-V7 compared to AR antagonists or degraders that only target the ligand binding domain of full-length AR, such as enzalutamide and ARV-110. Our results put forth a pathfinder molecule EN1441 that targets an intrinsically disordered cysteine within AR to destabilize, degrade, and inhibit both AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and highlights the utility of covalent ligand discovery approaches in directly targeting, destabilizing, inhibiting, and degrading classically undruggable transcription factor targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Currently available algorithms enable mining of proteins based on their sequence or structure. However, activities of many proteins, such as enzymes and drug targets, are dictated by active site residues and their surroundings rather than the overall structure or sequence of a protein. Here we present ActSeek - a computer vision-inspired fast program - that searches structural databases for proteins with active sites similar to the seed protein. ActSeek is implemented to mine proteins with desired active site environments from the Alphafold database. The potential of ActSeek to find innovative solutions to the worlds most pressing challenges is demonstrated by finding enzymes that may be used to produce biodegradable plastics or degrade plastics, as well as potential off-targets for common drug molecules.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

The most popular ANI algorithms are available as command-line tools and/or web applications, making it inconvenient or impossible to incorporate them into bioinformatic workflows, which utilize the popular Python programming language. Here, we present PyOrthoANI, PyFastANI, and Pyskani, Python libraries for three popular ANI computation methods. ANI values produced by PyOrthoANI, PyFastANI, and Pyskani are virtually identical to those produced by OrthoANI, FastANI, and skani, respectively. All three libraries integrate seamlessly with BioPython, making it easy and convenient to use, compare, and benchmark popular ANI algorithms within Python-based workflows.

Likely a consequence of the known instability of RNA relative to DNA, this has effectively nullified the use of herbaria for transcriptomics. Here, we challenge the assumption that herbaria cannot be used for transcriptomics by assembling transcriptomes from RNA extracted from herbarium specimens. Through systematic comparison of transcriptomes from fresh-collected, silica-dried, and archival specimens, we demonstrate the suitability of herbarium-derived RNA for transcriptomics. The practical applicability of archival mRNA was further illustrated by the functional validation of a plant immune receptor synthesized from a specimen collected in 1956. These results contradict the community consensus regarding archival RNA and open the door to subsequent transcriptomic explorations in rare and extinct species. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving and utilizing the diversity embedded within herbarium collections.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Despite intrinsic links to their oncogenic potential, the fidelity and mechanisms of ecDNA inheritance are poorly understood. Here, we show that ecDNA are protected against cytosolic mis-segregation through mitotic clustering and by tethering to the telomeric and subtelomeric regions of mitotic chromosomes. ecDNA-chromosome tethering depends on BRD4 transcriptional co-activation and mitotic transcription of the long non-coding RNA PVT1, which is co-amplified with MYC in colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines. Disruption of ecDNA-chromosome tethering through BRD4 inhibition, PVT1 depletion, or inhibiting mitotic transcription results in cytosolic mis-segregation, ecDNA reintegration, and the formation of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs). We propose that nuclear inheritance of ecDNA is facilitated by an RNA-mediated physical tether that links ecDNA to mitotic chromosomes and thus protects against cytosolic mis-segregation and chromosomal integration.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

In frogs, however, odontogenesis is delayed, occurring instead during the postembryonic metamorphosis. Nearly all adult frogs have teeth on the upper jaw and lack lower jaw dentition, but a single species re-evolved mandibular teeth. Developmental-genetic mechanisms that underlie tooth formation in frogs are poorly understood, including whether an ancestral program is partially retained in the lower jaw that could facilitate the evolutionary reappearance of lost mandibular teeth. Using a developmental series of an unconventional model species, we assessed 1) if the gene network underlying odontogenic competence is conserved in the late-forming teeth of frogs; 2) if unique keratinized mouthparts, which function as an alternative feeding tool in anuran larvae, impede tooth induction; and 3) if transient tooth rudiments form in the anuran mandible. The tooth development network is conserved in the frog upper jaw, which displays dental expression patterns comparable to those of other vertebrates. There is, however, no evidence of tooth development in the mandible. Teeth emerge before keratinized mouthparts degenerate, but their location may be spatially constrained by keratin, and gene expression patterns of keratinized mouthparts and teeth overlap. We hypothesize that the novel mouthparts of tadpoles did not arise de novo but instead originated by partially co-opting the developmental program that typically mediates true tooth development.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

While the design and modeling of peptides in general has seen rapid advances since the advent of modern machine learning methods, existing deep learning models cannot effectively predict cyclic peptide structures containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), which are often crucial for peptide therapeutics. To address this limitation, we here extend the recent AF3-style model Boltz to cyclic peptides with ncAAs. In addition to the positional encoding offset, we used a simple yet effective extension of the cyclic offset encoding based on AlphaFold3s tokenization scheme that allows the modeling of cyclic peptides with modified residues. On a test set of peptides with ncAAs, our approach outperforms HighFold2 on 13/17 cases, with an average C RMSD of 1.877[A] and an average all-atom RMSD of 3.361[A]. Our results show that the cyclic offset encoding shown for AlphaFold2 generalizes to AlphaFold3-based models and can be extended to incorporate ncAAs, showing potential in the design of novel cyclic peptides with ncAAs for therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

Among these tasks, cell type annotation remains particularly challenging, with researchers exploring various methods to improve accuracy and efficiency. While recent studies on GPT-like models have demonstrated annotation performance comparable to manual annotations, a significant gap remains in understanding their limitations and generalizability. In this work, we compare and evaluate the annotation performance of the GPT-4 model against traditional methods on nine randomly selected public single-cell RNA seq datasets from cellxgene, covering diverse tissue types. Our evaluation highlights the complexity of annotating cell types in single-cell data, revealing key differences between automated and manual approaches. We found specific cases where GPT-4 underperforms, demonstrating its limitations in certain contexts. We further introduce an automated approach to incorporate literature search using a RAG approach which enhances and outperforms GPT-4 cell type annotation when compared to traditional methods. We also introduce metrics based on taxonomic distance in the ontology tree to evaluate the granularity of the cell type annotations. To support future research, we also release an open-source Python package 1 that enables fully automated cell-type annotation of single-cell data using GPT-4 alongside other methods. The pipeline can take paper as an input and do cell type annotations on its own.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482

This was achieved by electroporation of strains stably expressing a codon-optimized Cas9 with two separate DNA molecules, one encoding a selectable marker flanked by short homology arms and a second encoding a sgRNA under the control of the U6 snRNA promoter. However, the efficiency of desired homology-dependent repair relative to undesired non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) events can be low and variable. Here, we describe methods and strains enabling extremely efficient ([~]99%) homology-dependent genome editing in C. neoformans. This high-efficiency method requires two manipulations. First, we placed the sgRNA-expressing segment into the marker-containing DNA flanked by targeting homology; thus, only a single DNA molecule is introduced into cells. Second, we used a strain mutant for the non-homologous end-joining factor Ku80 (encoded by YKU80). We also report the engineering of a yku80::amdS mutant strain harboring an insertion mutation that can be removed scarlessly via recombination between direct repeats. This enables the functional restoration of YKU80 after homology- dependent genome editing via selection against the amdS marker using fluoroacetamide. This approach minimizes documented drawbacks of using Ku-defective strains in downstream experiments. Finally, we describe a plasmid series that enables rapid cloning of sgRNA-marker constructs for genomic manipulation of C. neoformans, including gene deletion and C-terminal tagging. These methods, strains, and plasmids accelerate the genomic manipulation of C. neoformans.","NA","biorxiv",1740262086482
