China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1715724505535

Current hypotheses for the pathogenesis of Long Covid include persistent SARS-CoV-2, activation of other viruses, tissue damage, autoimmunity, endocrine insufficiency, immune dysfunction, and complement activation. We evaluated 142 participants, including uninfected controls (N=35), acutely infected individuals (N=54), convalescent controls (N=25), and Long Covid patients (N=28), by comprehensive immunologic, virologic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. Long Covid was characterized by persistent inflammatory pathways compared with convalescent controls and uninfected controls, including upregulation of IL-6 and JAK-STAT pathways as well as activation of coagulation, complement, metabolism, and T cell exhaustion pathways. Moreover, robust activation of these pathways during acute COVID-19 infection correlated with the subsequent development of Long Covid. In an independent validation cohort (N=47), Long Covid patients had higher levels of plasma IL-6R compared with convalescent controls and uninfected controls. These data demonstrate that Long Covid is characterized by persistent activation of chronic inflammatory pathways, suggesting novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

We therefore assessed and compared the feasibility of testing wastewater from inbound aircraft and airport terminals for 18 pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore, a popular travel hub in Asia. Methods Wastewater samples collected from inbound medium- and long-haul flights and airport terminals were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was carried out on positive samples to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. Airport and aircraft samples were further tested for 17 other pathogens through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results The proportion of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and the average virus load was higher for wastewater samples from aircraft as compared to airport terminals. Cross-correlation analyses indicated that viral load trends from airport wastewater led local COVID-19 case trends by two to five days. A total of ten variants (44 sub-lineages) were successfully identified from aircraft wastewater and airport terminals, and four variants of interest (VOIs) and one variant under monitoring (VUM) were detected in aircraft and airport wastewater 18-31 days prior to detection in local clinical cases. The detection of five respiratory and four enteric viruses in aircraft wastewater samples further underscores the potential to expand aircraft wastewater to monitoring pathogens beyond SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of aircraft wastewater testing for monitoring infectious diseases threats, potentially detecting signals before clinical cases are reported. The triangulation of similar datapoints from aircraft wastewater of international travel nodes could therefore serve as a useful early warning system for global health threats.","NA","medrxiv",1715724505535

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1715724505535

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

CryoEM has revolutionized structure determination of large proteins and their complexes, but a vast majority of proteins that underlie human diseases are small (<50 kDa) and usually beyond its reach due to low signal-to-noise images and difficulties in particle alignment. Current strategies to overcome this problem increase the overall size of small protein targets using scaffold proteins that bind to the target, but are limited by inherent flexibility and not being bound to their targets in a rigid manner, resulting in the target being poorly resolved compared to the scaffolds. Here we present an iteratively engineered molecular design for transforming Fabs (antibody fragments), into conformationally rigid scaffolds (Rigid-Fabs) that, when bound to small proteins (~20 kDa), can enable high-resolution structure determination using cryoEM. This design introduces multiple disulfide bonds at strategic locations, generates a well-folded Fab constrained into a rigid conformation and can be applied to Fabs from various species, isotypes and chimeric Fabs. We present examples of the Rigid Fab design enabling high-resolution (2.3-2.5 Angstroms) structures of small proteins, Ang2 (26 kDa) and KRAS (21 kDa) by cryoEM. The strategies for designing disulfide constrained Rigid Fabs in our work thus establish a general approach to overcome the target size limitation of single particle cryoEM.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequencing reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide similarity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequencing reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10-5 to 10-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

Over the last decade, there has been a notable shift from point-and-click pipeline solutions such as Galaxy towards command-line solutions such as Nextflow and Snakemake. We report on recent developments in the nf-core and Nextflow frameworks that have led to widespread adoption across many scientific communities. We describe how adopting nf-core standards enables faster development, improved interoperability, and collaboration with the >8,000 members of the nf-core community. The recent development of Nextflow Domain-Specific Language 2 (DSL2) allows pipeline components to be shared and combined across projects. The nf-core community has harnessed this with a library of modules and subworkflows that can be integrated into any Nextflow pipeline, enabling research communities to progressively transition to nf-core best practices. We present a case study of nf-core adoption by six European research consortia, grouped under the EuroFAANG umbrella and dedicated to farmed animal genomics. We believe that the process outlined in this report can inspire many large consortia to seek harmonisation of their data analysis procedures.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

Though the spatial arrangement of these extracellular assemblies is critical to their biological functions, visualization of ECM structure is challenging, in part because the biomolecules that compose the ECM are difficult to fluorescently label individually and collectively. Here, we present a cell-impermeable small molecule fluorophore, termed Rhobo6, that turns on and red shifts upon reversible binding to glycans. Given that most ECM components are densely glycosylated, the dye enables wash-free visualization of ECM, in systems ranging from in vitro substrates to in vivo mouse mammary tumors. Relative to existing techniques, Rhobo6 provides a broad substrate profile, superior tissue penetration, nonperturbative labeling, and negligible photobleaching. This work establishes a straightforward method for imaging the distribution of ECM in live tissues and organisms, lowering barriers for investigation of extracellular biology.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

As the synaptic and transcriptional changes that follow an acute cocaine exposure are mostly resolved within a few days, the molecular changes that encode the long-term cellular memory of the exposure within DNs remain unknown. To investigate whether a single cocaine exposure induces long-term changes in the 3D genome structure of DNs, we applied Genome Architecture Mapping and single nucleus transcriptomic analyses in the mouse midbrain. We found extensive rewiring of 3D genome architecture at 24 hours past exposure which remains or worsens by 14 days, outlasting transcriptional responses. The cocaine-induced chromatin rewiring occurs at all genomic scales and affects genes with major roles in cocaine-induced synaptic changes. A single cocaine exposure triggers extensive long-lasting changes in chromatin condensation in post-synaptic and post-transcriptional regulatory genes, for example the unfolding of Rbfox1 which becomes most prominent 14 days post exposure. Finally, structurally remodeled genes are most expressed in a specific DN sub-type characterized by low expression of the dopamine auto-receptor Drd2, a key feature of highly cocaine-sensitive cells. These results reveal an important role for long-lasting 3D genome remodelling in the cellular memory of a single cocaine exposure, providing new hypotheses for understanding the inception of drug addiction and 3D genome plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

The prokaryotic Argonaute protein DdmE uses a DNA guide to target plasmid DNA. A structure of the DdmDE complex, validated by in vivo mutational studies, shows that DNA binding by DdmE triggers disassembly of the DdmD dimer and loading of monomeric DdmD onto the non-target DNA strand. Finally, in vitro studies reveal that DdmD translocates in the 5 to 3 direction, while partially degrading the plasmid DNA. These findings provide critical insights into the architecture and mechanism of DdmDE systems in plasmid elimination.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

Inspired by the eukaryotic ubiquitination cascade, we developed an ATP-driven platform for C-terminal activation and peptide ligation based on E. coli MccB, a bacterial ancestor of ubiquitin-activating (E1) enzymes that natively catalyzes C-terminal phosphoramidate bond formation. We show that MccB can act on non-native substrates to generate an O-AMPylated electrophile that can react with exogenous nucleophiles to form diverse C-terminal functional groups including thioesters, a versatile class of biological intermediates that have been exploited for protein semisynthesis. To direct this activity towards specific proteins of interest, we developed the Thioesterification C-terminal Handle (TeCH)-tag, a sequence that enables high-yield, ATP-driven protein bioconjugation via a thioester intermediate. By mining the natural diversity of the MccB family, we developed two additional MccB/TeCH-tag pairs that are mutually orthogonal to each other and to the E. coli system, facilitating the synthesis of more complex bioconjugates. Our method mimics the chemical logic of peptide bond synthesis that is widespread in biology for high-yield in vitro manipulation of protein structure with molecular precision.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

Here we performed such rescues with a panel of receptor variants and promoters, in combination with tissue-specific transgene knockouts. Our experiments demonstrate that brassinosteroid receptor expression in several tissues is necessary but not sufficient for rescue. Moreover, complementation with tissue-specific promoters requires the genuine BRI1 gene body sequence, which confers ubiquitous expression of trace receptor amounts that are sufficient to promote brassinosteroid-dependent root growth. Our data, therefore, argue for a largely cell-autonomous action of brassinosteroid receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

ZmWUS1 overexpression in the Barren inflorescence3 mutant leads to defects in inflorescence development. Here, single-cell ATAC-seq analysis shows that ZmWUS1 overexpression alters chromatin accessibility throughout the central zone. The CAATAATGC motif, a known homeodomain recognition site, is predominantly observed in the regions with increased chromatin accessibility suggesting ZmWUS1 is an activator in the central zone. Regions with decreased chromatin accessibility feature various motifs and are adjacent to AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR genes, revealing negative regulation of auxin signaling in the central zone. DAP-seq of ZmWUS1 identified the TGAATGAA motif, abundant in epidermal accessible chromatin compared to the central zone.

We performed a deep-sequencing experiment using PacBio HiFi reads to obtain metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a pooled human gut microbiome. We performed long-read metagenome assembly using two methods (hifiasm-meta, metMDBG), used improved bioinformatic and proximity ligation binning strategies to cluster contigs and identify MAGs, and developed a novel framework to compare and consolidate MAGs (pb-MAG-mirror). We found proximity ligation binning yielded more MAGs than bioinformatic binning, but our novel comparison framework resulted in higher MAG yields than either binning strategy individually. In total, from 255 Gbp of total HiFi data we produced 595 total MAGs (including 175 high-quality MAGs) using hifiasm-meta, and 547 total MAGs (including 277 high-quality MAGs) with metaMDBG. Hifiasm-meta assembled almost twice as many strain-level MAGs as metaMDBG (246 vs. 156), but both assembly methods produced up to five strains for a species. Approximately 85% of the MAGs were assigned to known species, but we recovered >35 high-quality MAGs that represent uncultured diversity. Based on strict similarity scores, we found 125 MAGs were unequivocally shared across the assembly methods at the strain level, representing ~22% of the total MAGs recovered per method. Finally, we detected more total viral sequences in the metaMDBG assembly versus the hifiasm-meta assembly (~6,700 vs. ~4,500). Overall, we find the use of HiFi sequencing, improved metagenome assembly methods, and complementary binning strategies is highly effective for rapidly cataloging microbial genomes in complex microbiomes.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

But autoregressive models do not inherently require their inputs and outputs to be discrete.

Above the optimal plant growth range, plant immunity and in particular immune responses induced by nucleotide-binding leucine rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are dampened, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remains elusive. NLRs usually contain an N-terminal signaling domain, such as Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is self-sufficient to trigger immune signaling. By using inducible Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing TIR-containing NLRs (TNLs) or corresponding isolated TIR domains from Arabidopsis RPS4 and flax L6 NLRs, we showed that immune signaling induced downstream of TNL activation is not affected by an elevation of temperature. Conditional activation of TNL- and isolated TIR-mediated immune responses follow the same signaling route at permissive temperature (EDS1/RNLs requirement and activation of the salicylic acid sector). Yet, this signaling pathway is maintained under elevated temperature (30C) when induced by isolated TIRs, but not full-length TNLs. This work underlines the need to further study how NLRs are impacted by an increase of temperature, which is particularly important to improve the resilience of plant disease resistance in a warming climate.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

In the tropical montane islands of Fiji, there are 28 species of endemic bee in the subgenus Lasioglossum (Homalictus), where species richness increases with elevation despite decreasing land surface (habitat) areas. We used a combination of spatially explicit phylogenetic diversity analyses and phylogenetic trait analyses to examine the factors shaping species distributions in these bees. We found that species at higher elevations had lower heat tolerance and desiccation resistance than those at lower elevations, consistent with these traits constraining species elevational ranges. We also found high species phylogenetic diversity within mountains, and high phylogenetic signal in species heat tolerance and minimum elevational ranges, consistent with these traits being evolutionarily conserved among mountain-top taxa following vicariant (allopatric) speciation. We found no evidence to suggest that interspecific competition is shaping species elevational ranges. In all, our findings indicate that phylogenetic conservatism in physiological traits related to climatic niche, such as heat tolerance, can explain why species richness is highest at mountain tops in this system, with species having tracked their climatic niches over time towards ever higher (cooler and wetter) elevations. Because high elevations in this archipelago are extremely limited (~2.3% of total land area), only miniscule elevational (islands in the sky) remain into which this diverse, but climate-restricted fauna, can retreat as climates warm.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

Here we identify molecular players orchestrating this metabolic balance, and uncover a signaling molecule that mediates energy homeostasis during fat depletion. We show tissue-specific depletion of fatty acyl-CoA synthase FASN1 in the Drosophila fat body (FB) causes near complete fat loss and metabolic remodeling that dramatically elevates carbohydrate metabolism, leading to a striking ~20-fold increase in glycogen storage. Proteomics and metabolomics identify key factors necessary for rewiring including glycolysis enzymes and target-of-brain-insulin (tobi). FASN1-deficient flies are viable but starvation sensitive, oxidatively stressed, and infertile. We also identify CG10824/cDIP as upregulated in FASN1-depleted Drosophila. cDIP is a leucine-rich-repeat protein with homology to secreted adipokines that fine-tune energy signaling. We find FB-specific cDIP loss promotes Drosophila adult obesity, and is required for development in the absence of FASN1-dependent lipid storage. Collectively, we show fat-depleted Drosophila rewire their metabolism to complete development, and identify cDIP as a putative new cytokine that signals fat insufficiency and may regulate energy homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

Limited understanding of the phage infection process hampers our ability to utilize phages to their full therapeutic potential. To understand phage infection dynamics we performed proteomics on Enterococcus faecalis infected with the phage VPE25. We discovered numerous uncharacterized phage proteins are produced during phage infection of Enterococcus faecalis. Additionally, we identified hundreds of changes in bacterial protein abundances during infection. One such protein, enterococcal gelatinase (GelE), an fsr quorum sensing regulated protease involved in biofilm formation and virulence, was reduced during VPE25 infection. Plaque assays showed that mutation of either the fsrA or gelE resulted in plaques with a halo morphology and significantly larger diameters, suggesting decreased protection from phage infection. GelE-associated protection during phage infection is dependent on the murein hydrolase regulator LrgA and antiholin-like protein LrgB, whose expression have been shown to be regulated by GelE. Our work may be leveraged in the development of phage therapies that can modulate the production of GelE thereby altering biofilm formation and decreasing E. faecalis virulence.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

A primary driver of cardiovascular mortality is ischemic heart failure, a form of cardiac dysfunction that develops in patients who survive myocardial infarction. Acute cardiac damage triggers robust changes in the spleen with rapid migration of immune cells from the spleen to the heart. Activating this cardio-splenic axis contributes to progressive cardiac dysfunction. The cardio-splenic axis has, therefore, been identified as a promising therapeutic target to prevent or treat heart failure. However, our understanding of the precise mechanisms by which specific immune cells contribute to adverse cardiac remodeling within the cardio-splenic axis remains limited. Here, we show that splenic B cells contribute to the development of heart failure via MHC II-mediated antigen presentation. We found that the transfer of splenic B cells from mice with ischemic heart failure promoted adverse cardiac remodeling and splenic inflammatory changes in naive recipient mice. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of splenic B cells from mice with ischemic heart failure, we hypothesized that B cells contributed to adverse cardiac remodeling through antigen presentation by MHC II molecules. This mechanism was confirmed using transgenic mice with B cell-specific MHC II deletion and by analyzing circulating B cells from humans who experienced myocardial infarction. Our results broaden our understanding of B lymphocyte biology, reshape current models of immune activation in response to cardiac injury, and point towards MHC II-mediated signaling in B cells as a novel and specific therapeutic target in chronic heart failure.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

The genetics, biophysics and evolution of hydrophobic cores are not well understood, in part because of a lack of systematic experimental data on sequence combinations that do - and do not - constitute stable and functional cores. Here we randomize protein hydrophobic cores and evaluate their stability and function at scale. The data show that vast numbers of amino acid combinations can constitute stable protein cores but that these alternative cores frequently disrupt protein function because of allosteric effects. These strong allosteric effects are not due to complicated, highly epistatic fitness landscapes but rather, to the pervasive nature of allostery, with many individually small energy changes combining to disrupt function. Indeed both protein stability and ligand binding can be accurately predicted over very large evolutionary distances using additive energy models with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. As a result, energy models trained on one protein can accurately predict core stability across hundreds of millions of years of protein evolution, with only rare energetic couplings that we experimentally identify limiting the transplantation of cores between highly diverged proteins. Our results reveal the simple energetic architecture of protein hydrophobic cores and suggest that allostery is a major constraint on sequence evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505535

Proteins from the SMAX1- and SMXL78-clades of this family are targeted for degradation after karrikin or strigolactone perception, triggering downstream responses. We investigated how SMXL proteins control development. SMXL7 can partially replicate SMAX1 function in seeds and seedlings, but SMAX1 cannot replace SMXL7 in shoot branching control. Therefore, the distinct roles of these genes arise from differences in protein activity more than expression. Analysis of chimeras and domain deletions of SMAX1 and SMXL7 proteins revealed that an N-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient to specify developmental functions. We screened 158 transcription factors for interactions with SMAX1. The N-terminal domain is necessary and/or sufficient for the majority of candidate interactions. These discoveries enable cross-wiring of karrikin and strigolactone control of plant development and lay a foundation for understanding how SMXL proteins evolved functional differences.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

Charge-neutralizing modifications, such as histone acetylation, serve to disrupt this DNA-tail interaction, facilitating access to such residues. We previously showed that a polyacetylation-mediated chromatin 'switch' governs the read-write capability of H3K4me3 by the MLL1 methyltransferase complex. Here, we discern the relative contributions of site-specific acetylation states along the H3 tail and extend our interrogation to other chromatin modifiers. We show that the contributions of H3 tail acetylation to H3K4 methylation by MLL1 are highly variable, with H3K18 and H3K23 acetylation exhibiting robust stimulatory effects, and that this extends to the related H3K4 methyltransferase complex, MLL4. We show that H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 are found preferentially co-enriched with H3 N-terminal tail proteoforms bearing dual H3K18 and H3K23 acetylation (H3{K18acK23ac}). We further show that this effect is specific to H3K4 methylation, while methyltransferases targeting other H3 tail residues (H3K9, H3K27, & H3K36), a methyltransferase targeting the nucleosome core (H3K79), and a kinase targeting a residue directly adjacent to H3K4 (H3T3) are insensitive to tail acetylation. Together, these findings indicate a unique and robust stimulation of H3K4 methylation by H3K18 and H3K23 acetylation and provide key insight into why H3K4 methylation is often associated with histone acetylation in the context of active gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

Using our previously established genetic techniques to stabilize the structural capsid proteins, we demonstrate production of poliovirus VLPs of all three serotypes, from four different recombinant expression systems.

The molecular mechanisms behind these hyper-extended phenotypes - where genetic information of the parasite modulates the biology of one host to facilitate transmission through another host - remain largely unclear. This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that leaves are responsible for this attraction instead of leaf-like flowers. Here we made the surprising discovery that SAP54 enhances the colonization of plants by leafhopper females predominantly in the presence of leafhopper males, suggesting a sex-specific mechanism. In contrast, the presence of SAP54 alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males. Critically, the host plant MADS-box transcription factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

Here, we demonstrate that the macaque is capable of synchronizing taps to a subjective beat in real music, and even spontaneously chooses to do so over alternative strategies. This contradicts the influential ""vocal learning hypothesis"" that musical beat synchronization is only possible in species with complex vocalizations such as humans and some songbirds.

In line with its adaptability, P. aeruginosa produces various exoproducts crucial for survival and virulence, several of which regulated through quorum sensing (QS). These factors are also regulated in response to environmental cues, such as temperature changes. As a pathogen, P. aeruginosa is generally thought to activate its virulence factors at temperatures akin to warm-blooded hosts rather than environmental temperatures. Recent studies elucidated the functional structure of the QS transcriptional regulator RhlR, which depends on the stabilizing effects of its cognate autoinducing ligand, N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), and of the moonlighting chaperone PqsE. Given the influence of temperature on biomolecular dynamics, we investigated how it affects RhlR activity using the RhlR-regulated phzA1 promoter as a proxy. Unexpectedly, we found that RhlR activity is higher at 25{degrees}C than at 37{degrees}C. This temperature-dependent regulation likely stems from altered RhlR turnover, with the presence of PqsE extending RhlR activity tenfold from its basal level at 37{degrees}C to that observed at 25{degrees}C. This lower, environmental-like temperature promotes increased affinity between RhlR and C4-HSL, a trait significantly compromised in the absence of PqsE. These results suggest that this response depends on the structural integrity of the complex, indicating that temperature functions as an additional regulating and stabilizing factor of RhlR function. Accordingly, lower growth temperature fails to increase the activity of a structurally stabilized version of RhlR. The thermoregulation aspect of RhlR activity and signalling impacts the virulence profile of a mutant unable to produce C4-HSL, underscoring its significance in bacterial behaviours and potentially conferring an evolutionary advantage.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

MP20 forms tetramers each of which contain 4 transmembrane alpha-helices that are packed against one another forming a helical bundle. Both the N- and C- termini of MP20 are cytoplasmic. We found that each MP20 tetramer formed adhesive interactions with an opposing tetramer in a head-to-head fashion. These interactions were mediated by the extracellular loops of the protein. The dimensions of the MP20 adhesive junctions are consistent with the 11 nm thin lens junctions. Investigation of MP20 localization in human lenses indicated that in young fiber cells MP20 was stored intracellularly in vesicles and upon fiber cell maturation MP20 inserted into the plasma membrane and restricted the extracellular space. Together these results suggest that MP20 forms lens thin junctions in vivo confirming its role as a structural protein in the human eye lens, essential for its optical transparency.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

Unexpectedly, we discovered this capability in cyanobacteria, unicellular prokaryotes with generation times of only 5-6 h. Cyanobacteria in short winter-like days develop enhanced resistance to cold that involves desaturation of membrane lipids and differential programs of gene transcription, including stress response pathways.

Species-level resolution is limited in these studies, as each variable region enables the characterisation of a different subsection of the microbiome. Although long-read sequencing techniques take advantage of all 9 variable regions by sequencing the entire 16S rRNA gene, they are substantially more expensive. This work assessed the feasibility of accurate species-level resolution and reproducibility using a relatively new sequencing kit and bioinformatics pipeline developed for short-read sequencing of multiple variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, we evaluated the potential impact of different sample collection methods on our outcomes. Methods Using xGenTM 16S Amplicon Panel v2 kits, sequencing of all 9 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Mock cells and mock DNA for 8 bacterial species were included as extraction and sequencing controls respectively. Within-run and between-run replicate samples, and pairs of stool and rectal swabs collected at 0-5 weeks from the same participants, were incorporated. Observed relative abundances of each species were compared to theoretical abundances provided by ZymoBIOMICS. Paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests and distance-based intraclass correlation coefficients were used to statistically compare alpha and beta diversity measures, respectively, for pairs of replicates and stool/rectal swab sample pairs. Results Using multiple variable regions of the 16S ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid (rRNA) gene, we found that we could accurately identify taxa to a species level and obtain highly reproducible results at a species level. Yet, the microbial profiles of stool and rectal swab sample pairs differed substantially despite being collected concurrently from the same infants. Conclusion This protocol provides an effective means for studying infant gut microbial samples at a species level. However, sample collection approaches need to be accounted for in any downstream analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) offers a potential solution. Given a nanoscale map of two putative interaction partners, it should be possible to assign molecules either to the class of coupled pairs or to the class of non-coupled bystanders. Here, we developed a probabilistic algorithm that allows accurate determination of both the absolute number and the proportion of molecules that form coupled pairs. The algorithm calculates interaction probabilities for all possible pairs of localized molecules, selects the most likely interaction set, and corrects for any spurious colocalizations. Benchmarking this approach across a set of simulated molecular localization maps with varying densities (up to [~]50 molecules m-2) and localization precisions (5 to 50 nm) showed typical errors in the identification of correct pairs of only a few percent. At molecular densities of [~]5-10 molecules m-2 and localization precisions of 20-30 nm, which are typical parameters for SMLM imaging, the recall was [~]90%.

We investigated the effects of adopting a medical cannabis law on the cost of employer-sponsored health insurance.

MethodsWe analyzed state-level data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) Private Sector spanning from 2003 to 2022. The outcomes included log transformed average total premiums per employee for single, employee-plus-one, and family coverage plans. We utilized the Sun and Abraham (2021) difference-in-difference (DiD) method, looking at the overall DiD and event-study DiD. Models were adjusted for various state-level demographics and dichotomous policy variables including whether a state later adopted recreational cannabis as well as time and unit fixed effects and population weights.

ResultsFor states that adopted a medical cannabis law, there was a significant decrease in the log average total premium per employee for single (-0.034, standard error [SE] = 0.009) and employee plus one (-0.025, SE = 0.009) coverage plans considering the first 10 years of policy change compared to states without such laws. Looking at the last five years of policy change, we saw increases in effect size and statistical significance. Sensitivity analyses suggest findings are robust to our model specifications.

DiscussionAdoption of a medical cannabis law may contribute to decreases in healthcare costs. This phenomenon is likely a secondary effect and suggests positive externalities outside of medical cannabis patients.

Key PointsO_LIStates that passed medical cannabis laws, compared to states that did not pass such laws, saw decreases in the average total costs for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums.
C_LIO_LIThe difference in average total costs for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums, comparing states with and without medical cannabis laws, grew over time.
C_LIO_LIThis paper contributes to the idea that medical cannabis laws may contain positive externalities.

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1715724505536

ARHGAP19 is a GTPase-activating protein with activity towards RhoA. In vitro biochemical assays revealed that variants located within the GAP domain cause loss of GAP activity. iPSc-derived motor neurons exhibited 50% knockdown of ARHGAP19 protein. In vivo genetic perturbations of the Drosophila melanogaster ARHGAP19 ortholog RhoGAP54D reduced self-driven locomotor activity and startle responses to visual stimuli. Zebrafish loss-of-function models similarly exhibited movement deficits, coupled with increased motor neuron axonal branching but shorter caudal primary motor neurons. Together, these findings establish ARHGAP19 as a novel cause of early-onset neuropathy through a loss-of-function mechanism.","NA","medrxiv",1715724505536

The soft coral was identified as a xeniid octocoral (species undetermined), resembling the octocoral Unomia stolonifera, which has invaded and overgrown reefs in Venezuela in recent years. To conclusively characterize the species of the invading xeniid, we employed multilocus barcoding targeting four genes (ND2, mtMutS, COI, and 28S) of three separate colonies across three locations in southwest Puerto Rico. Sequence comparisons with xeniid sequences from GenBank, including those from the genera Xenia and Unomia, indicated a 100% sequence identity (>3,000 bp combined) with the species Xenia umbellata (Octocorallia : Malacalcyonacea : Xeniidae). Xenia umbellata is native to the Red Sea and to our knowledge, this represents the first confirmed case of this species as an invader on Caribbean reefs. Similar to U. stolonifera, X. umbellata is well known for its ability to rapidly overgrow substrate as well as tolerate environmental extremes. In addition, X. umbellata has recently been proposed as a model system for tissue regeneration having the ability to regenerate completely from a single tentacle. These characteristics greatly amplify X. umbellatas potential to adversely affect any reef it invades.

As most data have been limited to chaired and typically head-restrained animals, the synergistic interactions of different motor actions/plans inherent to active sensing e.g. eyes, head, posture, movement, etc. on visual perception are largely unknown. To address this considerable gap in knowledge, we developed an innovative wireless head-mounted eye tracking system called CEREBRO for small mammals, such as marmoset monkeys. Our system performs Chair-free Eye-Recording using Backpack mounted micROcontrollers. Because eye illumination and environment lighting change continuously in natural contexts, we developed a segmentation artificial neural network to perform robust pupil tracking in these conditions. Leveraging this innovative system to investigate active vision, we demonstrate that although freely-moving marmosets exhibit frequent compensatory eye movements equivalent to other primates, including humans, the predictability of the visual system is enhanced when animals are freely-moving relative to when they are head-fixed. Moreover, despite increases in eye/head-motion during locomotion, gaze stabilization actually improved over periods when the monkeys were stationary. Rather than impair vision, the dynamics of gaze stabilization in freely-moving primates has been optimized over evolution to enable active sensing during natural exploration.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

Using a large UK Biobank sample of predominantly middle-aged adults, without neurological disease, our structural equation mediation models showed that poor cerebrovascular health, indicated by the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors, was associated with slowed processing speed. This effect was best explained by anterior white matter microstructure changes, rather than posterior changes. Effects were also significantly reduced when considering other forms of cognition, demonstrating both regional- and cognitive-specificity of our effects. Critically, our findings also demonstrate that including measures of risk factor duration may be particularly important for improving estimations of cerebrovascular burden.

Herein, we achieved de novo prediction of human virulence in Klebsiella pneumoniae by expanding known virulence genes with spatially proximal gene discoveries linked by functional domain architectures across all prokaryotes. This approach identified gene ontology functions not typically associated with virulence sensu stricto. By leveraging machine learning models with these expanded discoveries, public genomes were assessed for virulence prediction using categorizations derived from isolation sources captured in available metadata. Performance for de novo strain-level virulence prediction achieved 0.81 F1-Score. Virulence predictions using expanded ""discovered"" functional genetic content were superior to that restricted to extant virulence database content. Additionally, this approach highlighted the incongruence in relying on traditional phylogenetic subtyping for categorical inferences.

Applying a paired multiomic approach, we reveal key transcriptional circuits, in mouse and human hearts, which are associated with fibrosis development following non-ischemic cardiac insults, independent of disease model, species or biological sex. Strikingly, we find the key regulatory events driving fibrosis are reversible at the single-cell transcriptional and epigenomic level, further pointing to key factors regulating fibrosis development and resolution.

Downstream analysis methods, such as binning, gene copy number analysis, structural variations, or single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, commonly assume an even distribution across the genome after accounting for known artefacts such as GC content. We discovered coverage bias across gut microbiome species, manifesting as a difference in coverage before and after bacterial transcription start sites. Using matched metatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequencing data, we demonstrate that this bias correlates with gene expression. Potential artefacts such as the sequencing technology, reference genome used for alignment, and mappability bias were investigated across multiple datasets and shown to not be factors for association. While GC bias was found correlated with coverage bias, the association of coverage bias with gene expression remains significant after adjusting for GC bias. Paired-end read mapping demonstrated an enrichment in 5 read ends immediately downstream of the TSS which was partly a byproduct of unmapped reads upstream of the TSS. Our observations suggest the existence of strain-level variation where sequence variation in the promoter site region is preventing proper read alignment to the reference genome. The correlation of this phenomenon with gene expression may also reflect evolutionary footprints for fine-tuning the regulation of gene expression. Understanding the source of this sequence variation and the biological implications of this artefact will be useful not only to better characterise microbial functions but also to improve interpretations of strain level dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

EV-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) are, despite a relatively low abundance, extensively investigated for their selective incorporation and their role in cell-cell communication. In contrast, the sorting of highly-structured ncRNA species is understudied, mainly due to technical limitations of traditional small RNA sequencing protocols. Here, we adapted ALL-tRNAseq to profile the relative abundance of highly structured and potentially methylated small ncRNA species, including transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and Y RNAs in bulk EV preparations. We determined that full-length tRNAs, typically 75 to 90 nucleotides in length, were the dominant small ncRNA species (>60% of all reads in the 18-120 nucleotides size-range) in all cell culture-derived EVs, as well as in human plasma-derived EV samples, vastly outnumbering 21 nucleotides-long miRNAs. Nearly all EV-associated tRNAs were protected from external RNAse treatment, indicating a location within the EV lumen. Strikingly, the vast majority of luminal-sorted, full-length, nucleobase modification-containing EV-tRNA sequences, harbored a dysfunctional 3' CCA tail, 1 to 3 nucleotides truncated, rendering them incompetent for amino acid loading. In contrast, in non-EV associated extracellular particle fractions (NVEPs), tRNAs appeared almost exclusively fragmented or 'nicked' into tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) with lengths between 18 to 35 nucleotides. We propose that in mammalian cells, tRNAs that lack a functional 3' CCA tail are selectively sorted into EVs and shuttled out of the producing cell, offering a new perspective into the physiological role of secreted EVs and luminal cargo-selection.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

The use of protein degradation to control CAR signaling can address these issues in pre-clinical models. Existing strategies for regulating CAR stability rely on small molecules to induce systemic degradation. In contrast to small molecule regulation, genetic circuits offer a more precise method to control CAR signaling in an autonomous, cell-by-cell fashion. Here, we describe a programmable protein degradation tool that adopts the framework of bioPROTACs, heterobifunctional proteins that are composed of a target recognition domain fused to a domain that recruits the endogenous ubiquitin proteasome system. We develop novel bioPROTACs that utilize a compact four residue degron and demonstrate degradation of cytosolic and membrane protein targets using either a nanobody or synthetic leucine zipper as a protein binder. Our bioPROTACs exhibit potent degradation of CARs and can inhibit CAR signaling in primary human T cells. We demonstrate the utility of our bioPROTACs by constructing a genetic circuit to degrade the tyrosine kinase ZAP70 in response to recognition of a specific membrane-bound antigen. This circuit is able to disrupt CAR T cell signaling only in the presence of a specific cell population. These results suggest that bioPROTACs are a powerful tool for expanding the cell engineering toolbox for CAR T cells.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

Unlike flowering, hypocotyl elongation displays a greater plasticity to changes in the photoperiod with increases in daylength causing greater inhibition of growth until a threshold is met. Although we have a good understanding of how the photoperiod regulates hypocotyl elongation, previous investigations have only looked at hypocotyl development under a constant photoperiod. It is unknown if changes in the photoperiod during development influence hypocotyl elongation and whether the initial photoperiod exposure continues to impact subsequent development. Here, we developed a physiological assay to investigate this question. We have discovered that hypocotyl elongation is influenced by a memory of past photoperiod exposure in Arabidopsis and Brassicaceae cultivars used for microgreen agriculture. Photoperiodic memory persisted for multiple days, although it weakened over time, and the strength of the memory was dependent on the genetic background. We identified that phyB and ELF3, key regulators of hypocotyl development, were required for photoperiodic memory. Finally, we identified that the circadian clock is unlikely to function as a repository for photoperiodic memory as circadian rhythms quickly re-aligned with the new photoperiod. In summary, our work highlights for the first-time evidence of a photoperiodic memory that can control plant development.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

While several lysosomal calcium release channels have been described, how mammalian lysosomes replenish their calcium stores has not been determined. Using genetic depletion and overexpression techniques combined with electrophysiology and visualization of subcellular ion concentrations and their fluxes across the lysosomal membrane, we show here that TMEM165 imports calcium to the lysosomal lumen and mediates calcium-induced lysosomal proton leakage. Accordingly, TMEM165 accelerates the recovery of cells from cytosolic calcium overload thereby enhancing cell survival while causing a significant acidification of the perilysosomal area and the entire cytosol. These data indicate that in addition to its essential role in the glycosylation in the Golgi, a small but significant fraction of TMEM165 localizes on the lysosomal limiting membrane, where it protects cells against cytosolic calcium overload, preserves lysosomal function by refilling lysosomal calcium stores and regulates perilysosomal and lysosomal pH.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

MethodsIn a prospective cohort study in England, we assessed associations of self-reported heavy or prolonged bleeding and menstrual pain with school absences and attainment, adjusting for potential confounders.

FindingsOf 2,698 participants, 36% reported heavy or prolonged bleeding and 56% reported menstrual pain. Heavy or prolonged bleeding was associated with missing 1{middle dot}7 additional days of school per year (16{middle dot}58%; 95% CI: 9{middle dot}43, 24{middle dot}20), and 48% higher odds of being persistently absent ([&ge;]10% absent) (OR 1{middle dot}48; 95% CI: 1{middle dot}45, 1{middle dot}52). Menstrual pain was associated with missing 1{middle dot}2 additional days of school per year (12{middle dot}83%; 95% CI: 6{middle dot}14, 19{middle dot}95), and 42% higher odds of being persistently absent (OR 1{middle dot}42; 95% CI: 1{middle dot}39, 1{middle dot}46). Heavy or prolonged bleeding was associated with lower scores in compulsory examinations taken at age 16 (-5{middle dot}7 points; 95% CI: -10{middle dot}1, -1{middle dot}2, equating to one lower grade), and with 27% lower odds of achieving five standard passes (OR 0{middle dot}73; 95% CI: 0{middle dot}71, 0{middle dot}75). There was less evidence of an association between menstrual pain and examination scores (-3{middle dot}14 points; 95% CI: - 7{middle dot}46, 1{middle dot}17), but menstrual pain was associated with 16% lower odds of achieving five standard passes (OR 0{middle dot}84; 95 CI: 0{middle dot}81, 0{middle dot}86).

InterpretationBoth heavy or prolonged bleeding and menstrual pain were associated with lower school attendance and educational attainment. Greater research and support are needed to enable girls to achieve their full academic potential.

Despite this, the full extent of rubisco diversity and the biology of organisms that employ it for carbon fixation are still emerging, particularly in unlit ecosystems like the deep sea. Results: Here, we generate fifteen deeply-sequenced metagenomes along a spatially-resolved transect off the California coast, and combine them with globally-distributed public data to examine the diversity, distribution, and metabolic features of rubisco-encoding organisms from the dark water column. Organisms with rubisco were detected in the vast majority of all samples, spanning over 1,000 species groups and together comprising up to ~20% of the total microbial community. At 150 meters and below, potential for carbon fixation via rubisco was dominated by just two orders of gammaproteobacteria and SAR324, encoding either the form I or II rubisco. Many of these organisms also possessed genes for the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds, which may energetically support carbon fixation. Transcriptomic profiling in the epi- and mesopelagic suggested that all major forms of rubisco can be highly expressed in the deep water column, but are not done so constitutively, consistent with metabolic flexibility. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the genetic potential to fix carbon via rubisco is significant and spatially widespread in the dark ocean. We identify several rubisco-encoding species groups that are particularly abundant and cosmopolitan, highlighting the key role they may play in deep-sea chemoautotrophy and the global marine carbon cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, .1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

While immune elicitors trigger changes in plasmodesmal aperture, it is unknown how this contributes towards a full immune response. To investigate this, we developed two transgenic lines with which we could induce plasmodesmal closure independently of immune elicitors. Thus, we used the over-active CALLOSE SYNTHASE3 allele icals3m and the C-terminus of PDLP1 to drive callose deposition at plasmodesmata in response to estradiol treatment. These lines showed different degrees of plasmodesmal closure but both showed upregulation of the expression of stress responsive genes, the accumulation of salicylic acid and enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 in response to estradiol treatment. Enhanced resistance was not correlated with perturbation of the flg22-triggered ROS burst or MAPK signaling. Enhanced plasmodesmal closure using icals3m also led to the measurable accumulation of starch and sugars, decreased leaf growth, and induced leaf senescence. Additionally, induction of plasmodesmal closure using icals3m led to hypersusceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. We conclude that plasmodesmal closure itself can activate stress signaling, raising questions of how this occurs, what signal carries this information and whether these responses occur in all circumstances when plasmodesmata close across plant physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

A more elegant approach would be to directly reprogram the serine integrase itself to target a desired site endogenous to the genome that is different from the natural recognition site of the integrase. Here, we describe the development of a platform of Modular Integrases (the MINT platform), a versatile protein-guided genome editing method that can facilitate site-directed targeted integration of synthetic DNA into chromosomal sites.

Here we engineer H2A.Z sequence variants from diverse eukaryotes into a single host, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, to understand H2A.Zs transcriptional impact.

Here, we conducted functional assessments and deep molecular phenotyping in the aging mouse to demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) treatment attenuates body-wide age-related changes. Apart from improvements in physical and cognitive performance, the age-counteracting effects are prominently evident at multiple omic levels. These span the transcriptomes and DNA methylomes of various tissues, organs and circulating white blood cells, as well as the plasma metabolome. Importantly, the beneficial effects are specific to aged mice, not young adults, and are achieved with a low dosage of GLP-1RA which has a negligible impact on food consumption and body weight. The molecular rejuvenation effects exhibit organ-specific characteristics, which are generally heavily dependent on hypothalamic GLP-1R. We benchmarked the GLP-1RA age-counteracting effects against those of mTOR inhibition, a well-established anti-aging intervention, observing a strong resemblance across the two strategies. Our findings have broad implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of the clinically observed pleiotropic effects of GLP-1RAs, the design of intervention trials for age-related diseases, and the development of anti-aging-based therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

Within developing endochondral bones, chondrocytes at growth plate edges transition to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and other connective tissue in the marrow cavity, and in diseases such as Multiple Osteochondromas (MO) chondrocytes form abnormally around growth plates and contribute to ectopic bone. On the other hand, the inability to form new chondrocytes to maintain damaged joints contributes to the high incidence of osteoarthritis. In order to assess the ability of zebrafish to regenerate cartilage, we developed a nitroreductase-based cartilage ablation model. Following ablation at larval to adult stages, we observed new chondrocytes forming around the dead cartilage matrix, with cartilage outgrowths in ablated endochondral bones resembling the exostoses of MO. By generating a perichondrium-restricted hyal4:GFP transgenic line, we show that new chondrocytes arise from the perichondrium surrounding the ablated cartilage. In addition, we observe enriched expression of the retinoic acid (RA) synthesis gene aldh1a2 in the perichondrium following ablation, and the RA degrading enzyme gene cyp26b1 in newly forming chondrocytes. Consistent with RA signaling suppressing chondrogenesis, treatment with the RA receptor gamma agonist palovarotene, which has been used to treat MO, prevented ablation-induced chondrogenesis. Although we find that BMP signaling is also required for ablation-induced chondrogenesis, we show a distinct role for RA signaling in suppressing sox9a expression and chondrogenesis. Moreover, palovarotene resulted in a near complete loss of growth plates in uninjured zebrafish, which was due to the precocious dedifferentiation and exit of chondrocytes from the growth plate.

Thus far, we know little about the structuring of community functionality and the coupling between taxonomy and function over seasonal environmental gradients. To address this, we employed autonomous sampling devices and in situ sensors to investigate the taxonomic and functional dynamics of a pelagic Arctic Ocean microbiome over a four-year period. We demonstrate that the dominant prokaryotic and microeukaryotic populations exhibit recurrent, unimodal fluctuations each year, with community gene content following the same trend. The recurrent dynamics within the prokaryotic microbiome are structured into five temporal modules that represent distinct ecological states, characterised by unique taxonomic and metabolic signatures and connections to specific microeukaryotic populations and oceanographic conditions. For instance, Cand. Nitrosopumilus and the machinery to oxidise ammonia and reduce nitrite are signatures of early polar night, along with Radiolarians. In contrast, late summer is characterised by Amylibacter, sulfur compound metabolism and diverse Haptophyta lineages. Exploring the composition of modules further along with their degree of functional redundancy and the structuring of genetic diversity within functions over time revealed seasonal heterogeneity in environmental selection processes. In particular, we observe strong selection pressure on a functional level in spring while late polar night features weaker selection pressure that likely acts on an organismal level. By integrating taxonomic, functional, and environmental information, our study provides fundamental insights into how microbiomes are structured under pronounced environmental variability in understudied, yet rapidly changing polar marine ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

Hindwing tails that thwart bat attack have repeatedly originated in moon moths (Saturniidae), with longer tails having more pronounced anti-predator effect. Understanding the relative evolutionary balance between predation pressure and possible limiting factors requires a macroevolutionary perspective. To estimate the eco-evolutionary forces shaping tails, we conducted phylogenetically-informed linear regressions. We built a well-sampled, time-calibrated phylogeny of the entirely tailed moth group (Actias + Argema) and performed ancestral state reconstruction and biogeographical analyses. To generate metrics of evolutionary pressures, we developed estimates of bat predator abundance and estimated environmental conditions associated with individual moth wing measurements. This integrative approach reveals evidence for positive selection on hindwing tails and body size by bats and negative selective pressure from environmental factors. Our study provides insight into the tradeoffs between strong biotic selective pressures and abiotic constraints that shape elaborate traits across the tree-of-life.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

In mature root regions, endodermal cells coat their cell surface in a hydrophobic polymer termed suberin, which blocks solute transport across the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, specific cells adjacent to the water-conducting xylem remain unsuberized. These are termed ""passage cells"" based on the assumption that they create a ""passage"" for nutrient influx into vasculature in the otherwise sealed-off root regions. The identity and function of passage cells remain unknown, but their presence proposes the existence of individual identities within the endodermis. In this study, we probe this by performing an in-depth investigation of passage cells and endodermal suberization in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our work identifies the transcription factor MYB68 as a key regulator of suberization and endodermal lineage-specification related to passage cell formation. Through transcriptional profiling of myb68 mutants, we unravel genes with passage cell-associated expression that suggest a function in cation homeostasis. Collectively, our findings create a framework for a deeper understanding of radial cell identities within the endodermis and highlight that dynamic spatiotemporal patterning is an important physiological feature of root ground tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

The state-of-the-art PM stains are bright, specific, fluorogenic, and compatible with super-resolution imaging. However, when recording membrane dynamics, particularly under light-intensive microscopes, PM is prone to photodynamic damages due to its phospholipid bilayer nature. Here we developed PK Mem dyes tailored for time-lapse fluorescence imaging. By integrating triplet-state quenchers into the MemBright dyes featuring cyanine chromophores and amphiphilic zwitterion anchors, PK Mem dyes exhibited a three-fold reduction in phototoxicity and a more than four-fold improvement in photostability in imaging experiments. These dyes enable 2D and 3D imaging of live or fixed cancer cell lines and a wide range of primary cells, at the same time pair well with various fluorescent markers. PK Mem dyes can be applied to neuronal imaging in brain slices and in vivo two-photon imaging. The gentle nature of PK Mem palette enables ultralong-term recording of cell migration and cardiomyocyte beating. Notably, PK Mem dyes are optically compatible with STED/SIM imaging, which can handily upgrade the routine of time-lapse neuronal imaging, such as growth cone tracking and mitochondrial transportations, into nanoscopic resolutions.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

However, a survey of heritable insecticide susceptibility traits among wild-caught Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes, collected across an extensive study area composed largely of wilderness in southern Tanzania, necessitated that live mosquitoes were carried on foot over distances up to 25 km per day because most of the area was impassable by car, motorcycle or even bicycle during the rains. A self-cooling, self-humidifying carrier backpack was therefore developed that allows live adult mosquito specimens to be transported across rugged miombo woodland and floodplain terrain throughout the year. This wettable backpack was fabricated from stitched Tanzanian kitenge cotton fabric and PVC-coated fiberglass netting that allows easy circulation of air in and out. An outer cover flap made of cotton towelling embedded inside a kitenge envelope overhangs the fiberglass netting upper body of the bag, to protect mosquitoes from direct sunlight, and can be soaked with water to maintain low temperature and high humidity inside. Mean survival of insectary-reared female Anopheles arabiensis transported through 9 different mobile camps inside the 509 km2 Ifakara-Lupiro-Mangula Wildlife Management Area (ILUMA WMA), over up to 143km and 25 days, was indistinguishable from those left in the field insectary over the same period. Although considerable variance was observed between different batches of mosquitoes from the insectary and between individual cups of mosquitoes, the different levels and positions inside the backpack had no influence on survival. Temperature and humidity inside the backpack were maintained at standard insectary condition throughout, despite much more extreme conditions immediately outside. When the backpack was applied to collecting wild An. arabiensis and Anopheles quadriannulatus across a much larger study area of >4000 km2, encompassing the ILUMA WMA, some nearby villages and adjacent parts of Nyerere National Park (NNP), it achieved a mean survival rate of 58.2% [95% confidence interval 47.5 to 68.2]. Encouragingly, no difference in survival was observed between ILUMA WMA and NNP even though transport back from NNP involves much longer distances, sometimes involving lengthy journeys by car or boat. Overall, this mosquito carrier backpack prototype appears to represent a viable and effective method for transporting live wild-caught mosquitoes on foot across otherwise impassable terrain under challenging weather conditions with minimal detrimental impact on their survival.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1715724505536

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505536

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Timely identification of the fetal red blood cell antigen genotype for the antigen to which the pregnant person is alloimmunized is vital for determining fetal risk for HDFN and guiding management. Presently in the US, recommended care is to determine fetal antigen genotype with reproductive partner testing and/or amniocentesis. This approach has many limitations, including availability of reproductive partner testing, risk of nonpaternity, and low uptake of invasive testing such as amniocentesis. These barriers to obtaining fetal antigen genotype information lead to pregnancies not at risk for HDFN undergoing burdensome monitoring and, in some cases, unnecessary intervention. PCR-based qualitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping is available in Europe, however, it is offered at later gestational ages, may require a repeat sample, has a higher frequency of inconclusive results for individuals of non-European ancestry, and entails logistical challenges related to shipping and insurance coverage for patients in the US. The availability of a NGS-based quantitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping in the US that is robust for diverse populations and applicable for singleton and twin pregnancies starting at 10 weeks gestation presents an opportunity to assess performance.

MethodsPatients with alloimmunized pregnancies undergoing clinical fetal antigen cfDNA analysis were recruited to the study along with the neonates resulting from the pregnancies. The laboratory issued the results prospectively as a part of clinical care. After delivery, neonatal buccal swabs were sent to an outside laboratory, blinded to the fetal cfDNA results, for antigen genotyping, and the results were compared. Concordance was reported for the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis for antigens to which the pregnant person was alloimmunized as well as for all antigens for which the pregnant person was genotype negative.

ResultsWe observed complete concordance between the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis result and neonatal genotypes for 503 calls, for 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV across a racial and ethnically diverse cohort.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that cfDNA analysis for determining fetal antigen genotype is more accurate than real-life application of the current recommendations, ie., partner testing and amniocentesis, in a diverse US population. In addition, this noninvasive approach reduces barriers to obtaining timely, accurate information about fetal antigen genotype. These results support the routine implementation of fetal antigen cfDNA analysis to guide care of alloimmunized pregnancies in the US.","NA","medrxiv",1715724505536

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505537

We investigated the association between long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 and all-cause mortality and mortality from a wide range of specific causes in all 3,108 counties in the contiguous U.S., 2007-2020. Monthly county-level mortality data were collected from the National Center for Health Statistics. Wildfire smoke PM2.5 concentration was derived from a 10x10 km2 resolution spatiotemporal model. Controlling for non-smoke PM2.5, air temperature, and unmeasured spatial and temporal confounders, we found a non-linear association between 12-month moving average concentration of smoke PM2.5 and monthly all-cause mortality rate. Relative to a month with the long-term smoke PM2.5 exposure below 0.1 g/m3, all-cause mortality increased by 0.40-1.54 and 3.65 deaths per 100,000 people per month when the 12-month moving average of PM2.5 concentration was of 0.1-5 and 5+ g/m3, respectively. Cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease, digestive, endocrine, diabetes, mental, suicide, and chronic kidney disease mortality were all found to be associated with long-term wildfire smoke PM2.5 exposure. Smoke PM2.5 contributed to approximately 30,180 all-cause deaths/year (95% CI: 21,449, 38,910) in the contiguous U.S. Higher smoke PM2.5-related increases in mortality rates were found for people aged 65 above and racial minority populations. Positive interaction effects with extreme heat were also observed. Our study identified the detrimental effects of long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 on a wide range of mortality outcomes, underscoring the need for public health actions and communication to prepare communities and individuals to mitigate smoke exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1715724505537

Although AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-M) has the potential to fill this knowledge gap, standard AF-M confidence metrics do not reliably separate relevant PPIs from an abundance of false positive predictions. To address this limitation, we used machine learning on well curated datasets to train a Structure Prediction and Omics informed Classifier called SPOC that shows excellent performance in separating true and false PPIs, including in proteome-wide screens. We applied SPOC to an all-by-all matrix of nearly 300 human genome maintenance proteins, generating [~]40,000 predictions that can be viewed at predictomes.org, where users can also score their own predictions with SPOC. High confidence PPIs discovered using our approach suggest novel hypotheses in genome maintenance. Our results provide a framework for interpreting large scale AF-M screens and help lay the foundation for a proteome-wide structural interactome.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505537

These viruses have spread across the Americas causing morbidity and mortality in both wild and domestic birds as well as some mammalian species, including cattle. Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes. Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases. This study focuses on virus surveillance at this interface, combined with culturally responsive science education and community outreach.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505537

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505537

Provided that the target complexes may be localised in noisy, three-dimensional tomographic reconstructions, averaging images of multiple instances of these molecules can lead to structures with sufficient resolution for de novo atomic modelling. Although many research groups have contributed image processing tools for these tasks, a lack of standardisation and inter-operability represents a barrier for newcomers to the field. Here, we present an image processing pipeline for electron tomography data in RELION-5, with functionality ranging from the import of unprocessed movies to the automated building of atomic models in the final maps. Our explicit definition of metadata items that describe the steps of our pipeline has been designed for inter-operability with other software tools and provides a framework for further standardisation.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505537

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715724505537
