Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2 fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6 fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3 fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3 fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384789

However, the lack of defined structures and the high variability in sequence and conformational preferences has complicated such efforts. We sought to develop a method combining biophysical principles with deep learning to readily generate binders for any disordered sequence. Instead of assuming a fixed regular structure for the target, general recognition is achieved by threading the query sequence through diverse extended binding modes in hundreds of templates with varying pocket depths and spacings, followed by RFdiffusion refinement to optimize the binder-target fit. We tested the method by designing binders to 39 highly diverse unstructured targets. Experimental testing of [~]36 designs per target yielded binders with affinities better than 100 nM in 34 cases, and in the pM range in four cases. The co-crystal structure of a designed binder in complex with dynorphin A is closely consistent with the design model. All by all binding experiments for 20 designs binding diverse targets show they are highly specific for the intended targets, with no crosstalk even for the closely related dynorphin A and dynorphin B. Our approach thus could provide a general solution to the intrinsically disordered protein and peptide recognition problem.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.

Author summaryAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) play a critical role in the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses. Adaptive changes in AIVs enable them to infect mammalian species by altering viral interactions with host-specific factors, and one well-known example is the PB2-E627K mutation. Fortunately, this mutation is sporadic and rare in AIVs, usually occurring after infecting humans, and AIVs with PB2-627E, which is prevalent in poultry, cannot easily infect humans. However, if an AIV manages to overcome this species barrier, the risk of a pandemic originating from an AIV will significantly increase. In our study, we identified a dual adaptive variant called PB2-627V that combines avian-like properties of PB2-627E and human-like properties of PB2-627K. This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function. The mutation exhibited good fitness in both birds and humans, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. The PB2-627V polymorphism has been found in birds, humans, and mammals worldwide across more than ten AIV subtypes. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, we recommend considering PB2-627V as a new molecular marker to assess the pandemic potential of AIVs.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, transmission, and intervention strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

While the celebrated FORCE learning rule can train chaotic recurrent networks to produce coherent patterns by suppressing chaos, it requires non-local plasticity rules and extremely quick plasticity, raising the question of how synapses adapt on local, biologically plausible timescales to handle potential chaotic dynamics. We propose a novel framework called ""Predictive Alignment"", which tames the chaotic recurrent dynamics to generate a variety of patterned activities via a biologically plausible plasticity rule. Unlike most recurrent learning rules, predictive alignment does not aim to directly minimize output error to train recurrent connections, but rather it tries to efficiently suppress chaos by aligning recurrent prediction with chaotic activity. We show that the proposed learning rule can perform supervised learning of multiple target signals, including complex low-dimensional attractors, delay matching tasks that require short-term temporal memory, and finally even dynamic movie clips with high-dimensional pixels. Our findings shed light on how predictions in recurrent circuits can support learning.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

However, a general methodology for targeting IDPs/IDRs has yet to be developed. Here, we show that starting only from the target sequence of the input, and freely sampling both target and binding protein conformation, RFdiffusion can generate binders to IDPs and IDRs in a wide range of conformations. We use this approach to generate binders to the IDPs Amylin, C-peptide and VP48 in a range of conformations with Kds in the 3 -100nM range. The Amylin binder inhibits amyloid fibril formation and dissociates existing fibers, and enables enrichment of amylin for mass spectrometry-based detection. For the IDRs G3bp1, common gamma chain (IL2RG) and prion, we diffused binders to beta strand conformations of the targets, obtaining 10 to 100 nM affinity. The IL2RG binder colocalizes with the receptor in cells, enabling new approaches to modulating IL2 signaling. Our approach should be widely useful for creating binders to flexible IDPs/IDRs spanning a wide range of intrinsic conformational preferences.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

We can generalize by ignoring task-irrelevant features, report different features of a stimulus, and use different actions to report a perceptual judgment. These forms of flexible behavior are associated with small modulations of the responses of sensory neurons. While the existence of these response modulations is indisputable, efforts to understand their function have been largely relegated to theory, where they have been posited to change information coding or enable downstream neurons to read out different visual and cognitive information using flexible weights. Here, we tested these ideas using a rich, flexible behavioral paradigm, multi-neuron, multi-area recordings in primary visual cortex (V1) and mid-level visual area V4. We discovered that those response modulations in V4 (but not V1) contain the ingredients necessary to enable flexible behavior, but not via those previously hypothesized mechanisms. Instead, we demonstrated that these response modulations are precisely coordinated across the population such that downstream neurons have ready access to the correct information to flexibly guide behavior without making changes to information coding or synapses. Our results suggest a novel computational role for task-dependent response modulations: they enable flexible behavior by changing the information that gets out of a sensory area, not by changing information coding within it.

SignificanceNatural perceptual judgments are continuous, generalized, and flexible. We estimate the ripeness of a piece of fruit on a continuous scale, we generalize by judging the ripeness of either a mango or an avocado even though they look very different, we flexibly judge either the size or the ripeness of the same piece of fruit, and we can flexibly indicate the same perceptual judgment using a variety of behaviors such as by speaking or writing any of many languages. Here, we show that the response modulations in visual cortex long associated with cognitive processes, surround modulation, or motor planning are sufficient to guide all these aspects of natural perceptual decision-making. We find that across the population, these response modulations reorient and reformat visual representations so that the relevant information is used to guide behavior via communication with downstream neurons. Our results are an example of a general computational principle for flexible behavior that emerges from the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

However, empty droplets and poor quality cells are often captured in single cell genomics experiments and need to be removed to avoid cell type interpretation errors. Many automated and manual methods exist to identify poor quality cells or empty droplets, such as minimum RNA count thresholds and comparing the gene expression profile of an individual cell to the overall background RNA expression of the experiment. A versatile approach is to use unbalanced overall RNA splice ratios of cells to identify poor quality cells or empty droplets. However, this approach is computationally intensive, requiring a detailed search through all sequence reads in the experiment to quantify spliced and unspliced reads. We found that the expression level of MALAT1, a non-coding RNA retained in the nucleus and ubiquitously expressed across cell types, is strongly correlated with this splice ratio measure and thus can be used to similarly identify low quality cells in scRNA-seq data. Since it is easy to visualize the expression of a single gene in single-cell maps, MALAT1 expression is a simple cell quality measure that can be quickly used during the cell annotation process to improve the interpretation of cells in tissues of human, mouse and other species with a conserved MALAT1 function.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1721340384790

Fusion is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its receptor ACE2. Lipid rafts are dynamic nanodomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Rafts can act as platforms for entry of dierent viruses by localizing virus receptors, and attachment factors to the same membrane microdomains. Here, we first demonstrate that cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin inhibits Spike mediated fusion and entry. To further study the role of ACE2 lipid raft localization in SARS-CoV-2 fusion and entry, we design a GPI-anchored ACE2 construct. Both ACE2 and ACE2-GPI proteins are similarly expressed at the plasma membrane. Through membrane flotation assays, we show that in dierent cell lines, ACE2-GPI localises predominantly to raft domains of the plasma membrane while ACE2 is non-raft associated. We then compare the ability of ACE2 and ACE2-GPI to permit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and syncytia formation and replication of dierent viral variants. We find little dierence in the two proteins. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 entry and fusion are a cholesterol dependent and raft-independent process.

IMPORTANCERafts are often exploited by viruses and used as platforms to enhance their entry into the cell or spread from cell-to-cell. The membrane localization of ACE2 and the role of lipid rafts in SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell spread is poorly understood. The function of lipid rafts in viral fusion is often studied through their disruption by cholesterol-depleting agents. However, this process may have o-target impacts on viral fusion independently of lipid-raft disruption. Therefore, we created an ACE2 construct that localizes to lipid rafts using a GPI anchor. Conversely, wild-type ACE2 was non-raft associated. We find that the localization of ACE2 to lipid rafts does not modify the fusion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Typical MINFLUX microscopes localize the target molecule by scanning a zero-intensity focus around the molecule in a circular trajectory, with smaller trajectory diameters yielding lower localization uncertainties for a given number of photons. Since this approach requires the molecule to be within the scanned trajectory, MINFLUX typically relies on a photon-demanding iterative scheme with decreasing trajectory diameters. Although the iterative procedure does not substantially reduce the photon efficiency of MINFLUX, this approach is prone to misplacements of the trajectory and increases the systems complexity. In this work, we introduce ISM-FLUX, a novel implementation of MINFLUX using image-scanning microscopy (ISM) with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. ISM-FLUX provides precise MINFLUX localization within the trajectory while maintaining conventional photon-limited uncertainty outside it. The robustness of ISM-FLUX localization results in a larger localization range and greatly simplifies the architecture, which may facilitate broader adoption of MIN-FLUX.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

One such event is the dramatic reorganization of CTCF into senescence-induced clusters (SICCs). However, the molecular determinants, genomic consequences, and functional purpose of SICCs remained unknown. Here, we combine functional assays, super-resolution imaging, and 3D genomics with computational modelling to dissect SICC emergence. We establish that the competition between CTCF-bound and non-bound loci dictates clustering propensity. Upon senescence entry, cells repurpose SRRM2 --a key component of nuclear speckles-- and BANF1 --a  molecular glue for chromosomes-- to cluster CTCF and rewire genome architecture. This CTCF-centric reorganization in reference to nuclear speckles functionally sustains the senescence splicing program, as SICC disruption fully reverts alternative splicing patterns. We therefore uncover a new paradigm, whereby cells translate changes in nuclear biochemistry into architectural changes directing splicing choices so as to commit to the fate of senescence.

But for any given application, it is likely that just a small subset of informative time-series features is required to capture the dynamical quantities of interest. So, while comprehensive libraries of time-series features have been developed, it is useful to construct reduced and computationally efficient subsets for specific applications. In this work, we demonstrate a systematic process to deduce such a reduced set, focused on the problem of distinguishing changes to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series caused by a range of experimental manipulations of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity in mouse cortical circuits. We reduce a comprehensive library of over 7000 candidate time-series features down to a subset of 16 features, which we call catchaMouse16, that aims to both: (i) accurately characterize biologically relevant properties of fMRI time series; and (ii) minimize inter-feature redundancy. The catchaMouse16 feature set accurately classifies experimental perturbations of neuronal activity from fMRI recordings, and also shows strong generalization performance on an unseen mouse and human resting-state fMRI data where it tracks spatial variations in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cell densities, often with greater statistical power than the full hctsa feature set. We provide an efficient, open-source implementation of the catchaMouse16 feature set in C (achieving an approximately 60 times speed-up relative to the native Matlab code of the same features), with wrappers for Python and Matlab. This work demonstrates a procedure to reduce a large candidate time-series feature set down to the key statistical properties of mouse fMRI dynamics that can be used to efficiently quantify and interpret informative dynamical patterns in neural time series.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

This study aimed to examine FSH receptor (FSHR) expression in human pancreatic islets and the direct effects of FSH on insulin secretion, as well as explore FSHs metabolic role during puberty, focusing on enhanced insulin secretion during this critical period. FSHR gene and protein expression were detected in isolated human pancreatic islets and co-localized with insulin-producing beta-cells. Additionally, FSH at prepubertal (0.1 IU/L) and pubertal concentrations (10 IU/L) significantly enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and increased intracellular cAMP concentrations in intact human pancreatic islets. In children with obesity from the Beta-JUDO cohort (n=608), plasma FSH levels were positively associated with several insulin secretion indices, particularly in pubertal children. These findings suggest that FSH has significant metabolic roles beyond reproduction, involving insulin secretion and potentially contributing to puberty-related hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Using a modular Spiking Neuronal Network model based on empirical connectomes, we posit that multiple stored functional patterns can transiently reoccur when the system operates near a critical regime, generating realistic brain dynamics and structural-functional relationships. The connections in the model are chosen as to force the network to learn and propagate suited modular spatiotemporal patterns. To test our hypothesis, we employ magnetoencephalography and tractography data from five healthy individuals.

The diazotrophic photoautotrophs also serve as a hub for specialized heterotrophic bacterial communities whose physiological contributions are poorly understood. By comparing the axenic strain Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 and the related strains Nostoc sp. KVJ2 and KVJ3, which still maintain their heterotrophic microbiome, we were able to demonstrate an almost obligate dependence of the cyanobacteria on the heterotrophic partners under carbon-limiting conditions. Detailed analysis of the intimate bilateral relationship between N. punctiforme and the isolate Agrobacterium tumefaciens Het4 using shotgun proteomics and microscopy uncovered a complex partnership characterized, among other traits, by competition for iron and facilitation for carbon. Although competitive interactions with A. tumefaciens Het4 compromise nitrogen fixation and stimulate the degradation of cyanophycin, mutualistic dependency prevails under inorganic carbon limitation. Both the absence of the high affinity bicarbonate uptake transporter SbtA and the prevalent extracarboxysomal localization of the carbon-fixing enzyme RubisCO, as detected by immunofluorescence microscopy, suggest that a weak carbon concentrating mechanism in N. punctiforme enforces a dependence on heterotrophic bacteria. Further, immunofluorescence, electron microscopic and proteomic analyses reveal a pronounced extracellular recycling of proteins under N- and C-limiting conditions.

Each immunoreceptor recognises a matching, strain-specific powdery mildew effector encoded by an avirulence gene (AVRa). We present here the cryo-EM structure of barley MLA13 in complex with its cognate effector AVRA13-1. The effector adopts an RNase-like fold when bound to MLA13 in planta, similar to crystal structures of other RNase-like AVRA effectors purified from E. coli. AVRA13-1 interacts via its basal loops with MLA13 C-terminal leucine rich repeats (LRRs) and the central winged helix domain (WHD). Co-expression of structure-guided MLA13 and AVRA13-1 substitution variants show that the receptor-effector interface plays an essential role in mediating immunity-associated plant cell death. Furthermore, by combining structural information from the MLA13-AVRA13-1 heterocomplex with sequence alignments of other MLA receptors, we designed a single amino acid substitution in MLA7 that enables expanded effector detection of AVRA13-1 and the virulent variant AVRA13-V2. In contrast to the pentameric conformation of previously reported effector-activated CNL resistosomes, MLA13 was purified and resolved as a stable heterodimer from an in planta expression system. Our study suggests that the MLA13-AVRA13-1 heterodimer might represent a CNL output distinct from CNL resistosomes and highlights opportunities for the development of designer gain-of-function NLRs.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

However, little is known about the neuronal circuits governing how odors influence and modulate sound processing. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying auditory-olfactory integration using anatomical, electrophysiological, and optogenetic approaches, focusing on the auditory cortex as a key locus for cross-modal integration. First, retrograde and anterograde viral tracing strategies revealed a direct projection from the piriform cortex to the auditory cortex. Next, using in vivo electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity in the auditory cortex of awake mice, we found that odor stimuli modulate auditory cortical responses to sound. Finally, we used in vivo optogenetic manipulations during electrophysiology to demonstrate that olfactory modulation in auditory cortex, specifically, odor-driven enhancement of sound responses, depends on direct input from the piriform cortex. Together, our results identify a novel cortical circuit shaping olfactory modulation in the auditory cortex, shedding new light on the neuronal mechanisms underlying auditory-olfactory integration.

Significance StatementAll living organisms exist within multisensory environments, yet there is a lack in our understanding of how the brain integrates multisensory information. This work elucidates novel circuits governing auditory-olfactory integration in the auditory cortex. Our results shed new light on a relatively understudied area of multisensory research, promising a more robust understanding of how animals and humans perceive and interact within complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1721340384790

Conversely, dietary fiber has been associated with a reduced risk of CVD and been proposed to exhibit beneficial effects on gut health. Considering these associations, we conducted an intervention study to investigate the influence of fiber supplementation on intestinal TMAO formation and its response after beef consumption.

Our randomized, double blind, pilot study MEATMARK included thirteen volunteers who underwent a dietary fiber and placebo intervention over two weeks. We assessed the effect of fiber supplementation on the gut microbiota and expression of the enzyme cutC, a key enzyme for microbial TMA formation, a precursor for TMAO. We measured the TMAO response following beef consumption after the two-week intervention. We further investigated the impact of three human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the expression of the hepatic enzyme FMO3 on TMAO plasma levels, as this factor is responsible for the final oxidation step from TMA to TMAO.

Our findings indicate that dietary fiber supplementation attenuated TMAO formation after beef intake, particularly in participants with habitual lower daily meat consumption. Furthermore, we observed a significant downregulation of cutC expression in response to the fiber intervention, suggesting a potential mechanism to reduce plasma TMAO. Considering these findings, a high fiber, low meat diet presents a promising dietary strategy for reducing this CVD risk factor.

All participants underwent two weeks of left leg immobilization via the use of crutches and a locking leg brace. After this two-week period, all participants underwent eight weeks (3 d/week) of knee extensor focused progressive RT. Vastus lateralis (VL) ultrasound-derived thickness and muscle cross-sectional area were measured at baseline (PRE), immediately after disuse (MID), and after RT (POST) with VL muscle biopsies collected at these time points. T and UT presented lower ultrasound derived VL size (cross-sectional area and thickness) values at MID versus PRE (p[&le;]0.001), and values increased in both groups from MID to POST (p<0.05); however, VL size increased from PRE to POST in UT only (p<0.001). Mean and type II myofiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) values demonstrated a main effect of time where PRE and POST were greater than MID (p<0.05) and main effect of training status where T was greater than UT (P[&le;]0.012). In both groups, satellite cell number was not affected by leg immobilization but increased in response to RT (p[&le;]0.014), with T being greater than UT across all time points (p=0.004). Additionally, ribosome content (total RNA) decreased (p=0.010) from PRE to MID while the endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins (BiP, Xbp1s, and CHOP) increased from MID to POST regardless of training status. Finally, the phosphorylation states of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 signaling proteins were not significantly altered for either group throughout the intervention. In conclusion, immobilization-induced muscle atrophy and recovery RT hypertrophy outcomes are similar between UT and T participants, and the lack of molecular signature differences between groups supports these findings. However, these data are limited to younger adults undergoing non-complicated disuse. Thus, further investigation to determine the impact of training status on prolonged leg immobilization models mirroring current medical protocols (e.g., following orthopedic injury and surgery) is warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

At the same time, improved computational models are capable of reproducing behavior and neural activity with increasing fidelity. Unfortunately, these advances have drastically increased the complexity of integrating different lines of research, resulting in the missed opportunities and untapped potential of suboptimal experiments. Experiment simulation can help bridge this gap, allowing model and experiment to better inform each other by providing a low-cost testbed for experiment design, model validation, and methods engineering. Specifically, this can be achieved by incorporating the simulation of the experimental interface into our models, but no existing tool integrates optogenetics, two-photon calcium imaging, electrode recording, and flexible closed-loop processing with neural population simulations. To address this need, we have developed Cleo: the Closed-Loop, Electrophysiology, and Optophysiology experiment simulation testbed. Cleo is a Python package enabling injection of recording and stimulation devices as well as closed-loop control with realistic latency into a Brian spiking neural network model. It is the only publicly available tool currently supporting two-photon and multi-opsin/wavelength optogenetics. To facilitate adoption and extension by the community, Cleo is open-source, modular, tested, and documented, and can export results to various data formats. Here we describe the design and features of Cleo, validate output of individual components and integrated experiments, and demonstrate its utility for advancing optogenetic techniques in prospective experiments using previously published systems neuroscience models.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Here, we evaluated 59 healthy individuals using resting-state fMRI to determine how network-level temporal dynamics were impacted by two well-characterized pharmacotherapies targeting catecholamines: methylphenidate (20mg) and haloperidol (2mg). Network dynamic changes were tested for links with drug-induced alterations in complex corticostriatal connections as this circuit is a primary site of action for both drugs. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was used. Methylphenidate enhanced time spent in the default mode network (DMN p<0 .001) and dorsal attention network (DAN p<0.001) and reduced time in the frontoparietal network (p<0.01). Haloperidol increased time in a sensory motor-DMN state (p<0.01). The magnitude of change in network dynamics induced by methylphenidate vs. placebo was correlated with the magnitude of methylphenidate-induced rearrangement of complex corticostriatal connectivity (R=0.32, p=0.014). Haloperidol did not alter complex corticostriatal connectivity. Methylphenidate increased time in networks involved in internal (DMN) and external attention (DAN), aligning with methylphenidates established role in attention. Methylphenidate also significantly changed complex corticostriatal connectivity by altering the relative strength between multiple corticostriatal connections, indicating that methylphenidate may shift which corticostriatal connections are prioritized relative to others. Findings further show that these local circuit changes are linked with large scale network function. Collectively, these findings provide a deeper understanding of large-scale network function, set a stage for mechanistic understanding of network engagement, and provide needed information to potentially guide medication use based on network-level effects.","NA","medrxiv",1721340384790

Participants were randomised to the primary intervention (prebiotic blend; 30g/d) or control (bread croutons; 28g/d; isocaloric functional equivalent) or a daily probiotic (L. rhamnosus). The primary outcome was change in  favourable and  unfavourable microbiome species compared to control, secondary outcomes included changes in blood metabolites, gut symptoms, stool output, anthropometric measures, subjective hunger, sleep, energy and mood. A crossover test meal challenge sub-study was conducted in 34 participants, investigating postprandial glucose responses, subjective hunger, satiety and mood.

In the 349 male and female participants (mean age 50yrs) included in the analysis (intention-to-treat), self-reported adherence was high (> 98% for all treatments). Following the prebiotic blend, significant improvements were seen in the change and ranking of  favourable and  unfavourable species as well as beta diversity (weighted-UniFrac measure), but not in the control or probiotic group. There were significantly greater improvements in self reported indigestion, constipation, heartburn, flatulence and energy, following the prebiotic vs control, and hunger following the prebiotic vs probiotic. Addition of the prebiotic to a high carbohydrate test meal challenge resulted in significant improvements in subjective hunger, fullness, and energy (3h incremental area under the curve). No other significant differences between groups were observed.

This prebiotic blend is a simple dietary strategy that benefits gut microbiome composition, gut symptoms and self-reported energy and hunger.

Animals that use this strategy have many ways of finding each other, organizing behaviors and consuming prey. There is wide variation in the extent to which these behaviors are coordinated and the stability of individual roles. This study characterizes social predation by the nudibranch mollusc, Berghia stephanieae, which is a specialist predator that eats only the sea anemone, Exaiptasia diaphana. A combination of experimental and modeling approaches showed that B. stephanieae does predate upon E. diaphana in groups. The extent of social feeding was not altered by length of food deprivation, suggesting that animals are not shifting strategies based on internal state. It was unclear what cues the individual Berghia used to find each other; choice assays testing whether they followed slime trails, were attracted to injured anemones, or preferred conspecifics feeding did not reveal any cues. Individuals did not exhibit stable roles, such as leader or follower, rather the population exhibited fission-fusion dynamics with temporary roles during predation. Thus, the Berghia provides an example of a specialist predator of dangerous prey that loosely organizes social feeding, which persists across hunger states and uses temporary individual roles; however, the cues that it uses for aggregation are unknown.

Significance StatementSocial predation is a strategy to hunt dangerous prey and minimize injury. Many nudibranchs specialize as predators of cnidarians, which are dangerous to them. Although nudibranchs are typically characterized as solitary hunters, we provide evidence that social predation strategies may be used by a species that specializes on one species of sea anemone. The study showed that the individual sea slugs assumed temporary roles for establishing groups and that the group dynamics were unstable. However, the cues that the nudibranchs use to aggregate remain elusive.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Some species exhibited an extraordinary tolerance against high-dose irradiation even in a hydrated state. Given that natural sources of high radiation are rare, the selective pressure to obtain such a high radiotolerance during evolution remains elusive. It has been postulated that high radiation tolerances could be derived from adaptation to dehydration, because both dehydration and radiation cause similar damage on biomolecules at least partly, e.g., DNA cleavage and oxidation of various biomolecules, and dehydration is a common environmental stress that terrestrial organisms should adapt to. Although tardigrades are known for high radiotolerance, the radiotolerance records have been reported only for desiccation-tolerant tardigrade species and nothing was known about the radio-tolerance in desiccation-sensitive tardigrade species. Hence, the relationship between desiccation-tolerance and radio-tolerance remained unexplored. To this end, we examined the radiotolerance of the desiccation-sensitive tardigrade, Grevenius myrops (formerly known as Isohypsibius myrops) in comparison to the well-characterized desiccation-tolerant tardigrade, Ramazzottius varieornatus. The median lethal dose (LD50) of G. myrops was approximately 2,240 Gy. This was much lower than those reported for desiccation tolerant eutardigrades. The effects of irradiation on the lifespan and the ovipositions were more severe in G. myrops compared to those in R. varieornatus. The present study provides the precise records on the radiotolerance of a desiccation-sensitive tardigrade and the current data supported the certain correlation between desiccation tolerance and radiotolerance at least in eutardigrades.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

However, limited efficacy and emergence of drug resistance are major handicaps for successful treatments. Here, by using relevant preclinical models, we found that Connexin43 (Cx43), a protein that plays a role in cell-to-cell communication, increases effectiveness of BRAF/MEKi by recruiting DNA repair complexes to lamin-associated domains and promoting persistent DNA damage and cellular senescence. The nuclear compartmentalization promoted by Cx43 contributes to genome instability and synthetic lethality caused by excessive DNA damage, which could lead to a novel therapeutic approach for these tumours to overcome drug resistance. Based on these findings, we designed an innovative drug combination using small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) to deliver the full-Cx43 in combination with the BRAF/MEKi. This study reveals Cx43 as a new player on DNA repair and BRAF/MEKi response, underlining the therapeutical potential that this approach could eventually have in the clinic to overcome the limitations of current therapies and improve treatment outcomes for patients with advanced BRAF mutant tumours.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Scalable digital solutions will be essential to expand access to high-quality mental healthcare. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a digital intervention to alleviate mild, moderate and severe symptoms of generalized anxiety. This structured, evidence-based program combined an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven conversational agent to deliver content with human clinical oversight and user support to maximize engagement and effectiveness. The digital intervention was compared to three propensity-matched real-world patient comparator groups: i) waiting control; ii) face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and iii) remote typed-CBT. Endpoints for effectiveness, engagement, acceptability, and safety were collected before, during and after the intervention, and at one-month follow-up. Participants (n=299) used the program for a median of 6 hours over 53 days. There was a large clinically meaningful reduction in anxiety symptoms for the intervention group (per-protocol (n=169): change on GAD-7 = -7.4, d = 1.6; intention-to-treat (n=299): change on GAD-7 = -5.4, d = 1.1) that was statistically superior to the waiting control, non-inferior to human-delivered care, and was sustained at one-month follow-up. By combining AI and human support, the digital intervention achieved clinical outcomes comparable to human-delivered care while significantly reducing the required clinician time. These findings highlight the immense potential of technology to scale effective evidence-based mental healthcare, address unmet need, and ultimately impact quality of life and economic burden globally.","NA","medrxiv",1721340384790

Current understanding indicates that NMD is often significantly suppressed during viral infections to protect the viral genome. In numerous viruses, this inhibition is achieved through direct or indirect interference with the RNA helicase UPF1, thereby promoting viral replication and enhancing pathogenesis. In this study, we employed biochemical, biophysical assays, and cellular investigations to explore the interplay between UPF1 and the Nucleocapsid (Np) protein of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated their direct interaction and its impact on inhibiting cellular NMD. Furthermore, we characterized how this interaction affects UPF1's enzymatic function. Our findings demonstrate that Np inhibits the unwinding activity of UPF1 by physically obstructing its access to structured nucleic acid substrates. Additionally, we showed that Np binds directly to UPF2, disrupting the formation of the UPF1/UPF2 complex essential for NMD progression. Intriguingly, our research also uncovered a surprising pro-viral role of UPF1 and an antiviral function of UPF2. These results unveil a novel, multi-faceted mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the host's defenses and manipulates cellular components. This underscores the potential therapeutic strategy of targeting Np-UPF1/UPF2 interactions to treat COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

In 2020, RSV was effectively eliminated from the community in New Zealand due to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) used to control the spread of COVID-19. However, in April 2021, following a brief quarantine-free travel agreement with Australia, there was a large-scale nationwide outbreak of RSV that led to reported cases more than five times higher, and hospitalisations more than three times higher, than the typical seasonal pattern. In this study, we generated 1,471 viral genomes of both RSV-A and RSV-B sampled between 2015 and 2022 from across New Zealand. Using a phylodynamics approach, we used these data to better understand RSV transmission patterns in New Zealand prior to 2020, and how RSV became re-established in the community following the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions. We found that in 2021, there was a large epidemic of RSV in New Zealand that affected a broader age group range compared to the usual pattern of RSV infections. This epidemic was due to an increase in RSV importations, leading to several large genomic clusters of both RSV-A ON1 and RSV-B BA9 genotypes in New Zealand. However, while a number of importations were detected, there was also a major reduction in RSV genetic diversity compared to pre-pandemic seasonal outbreaks. These genomic clusters were temporally associated with the increase of migration in 2021 due to quarantine-free travel from Australia at the time. The closest genetic relatives to the New Zealand RSV genomes, when sampled, were viral genomes sampled in Australia during a large, off-season summer outbreak several months prior, rather than cryptic lineages that were sustained but not detected in New Zealand. These data reveal the impact of NPI used during the COVID-19 pandemic on other respiratory infections and highlight the important insights that can be gained from viral genomes.","NA","medrxiv",1721340384790

In many species, these regulatory domains are established during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). In Drosophila, ZGA occurs after 13 fast, reductive, syncytial nuclear divisions during which the nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio grows exponentially. These divisions incorporate maternally-loaded, cytoplasmic pools of histones into chromatin. Previous work found that chromatin incorporation of replication-coupled histone H3 decreases while its variant H3.3 increases in the cell cycles leading up to ZGA. In other cell types, H3.3 is associated with sites of active transcription as well as heterochromatin, suggesting a link between H3.3 incorporation and ZGA. Here, we examine the factors that contribute to H3.3 incorporation at ZGA. We identify a more rapid decrease in the nuclear availability of H3 than H3.3 over the final pre-ZGA cycles. We also observe an N/C ratio-dependent increase in H3.3 incorporation in mutant embryos with non-uniform local N/C ratios. We find that chaperone binding, not gene expression, controls incorporation patterns using H3/H3.3 chimeric proteins at the endogenous H3.3A locus. We test the specificity of the H3.3 chaperone pathways for H3.3 incorporation using Hira (H3.3 chaperone) mutant embryos. Overall, we propose a model in which local N/C ratios and specific chaperone binding regulate differential incorporation of H3.3 during ZGA.

Patients with loss-of-function mutations in the ARPC5 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex develop inflammation and immunodeficiency after birth, leading to early mortality. However, the mechanistic basis for these phenotypes remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that loss of Arpc5 in the murine hematopoietic system, but not the corresponding Arpc5l isoform causes early-onset intestinal inflammation. This condition is initiated by microbiota breaching the ileal mucosa, leading to local and systemic inflammation. Macrophage and neutrophils infiltrate into the ileum, but in the absence of Arpc5 fail to restrict microbial invasion. Loss of Arpc5 compromises the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and kill intra-cellular bacteria. Our results underscore the indispensable role of Arpc5, but not Arpc5l containing Arp2/3 complexes in mononuclear phagocytes function and host-microbiota homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Protrudin recruits KIF5 to provide a FYCO1-independent force to fission endosomal tubules in neurons and non-polarised cells.

AbstractFission of transport tubules from early endosomes is required for endosomal sorting, but mechanisms of endosomal tubule fission (ETF) are incompletely understood. We show protrudin acts at ER-endosome contacts to promote ETF and endosome-to-Golgi traffic. Protrudin-mediated ETF required its ability to interact with ER-localised VAP proteins, endosomal phosphoinositides and KIF5. These properties also regulated the distance between protrudin and endosomal tubules. The defective ETF phenotype of increased endosomal tubulation in cells lacking protrudin was phenocopied by depletion of KIF5, but not FYCO1, a motor protein adaptor implicated in protrudin-dependent late endosome motility. It also required intact microtubules and dynein, consistent with a model where protrudin facilitates a tug-of-war between KIF5 and dynein to fission tubules. In addition to its direct role, protrudin links many other machineries involved in ETF, thus our findings elucidate how ETF is co-ordinated. These machineries are enriched for proteins implicated in hereditary motor neuron disorders, and protrudin or KIF5 depletion caused defective ETF in human neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

The relationship between cell shape and forces has been extensively studied for cells seeded on flat 2-dimensional (2D) substrates, but not for cells in more physiological three-dimensional (3D) settings. Here, we demonstrate a technique called 3D micropatterned traction force microscopy (3D-TFM) to confine cells in three-dimensional wells of defined shape, while simultaneously measuring the forces transmitted between cells and their microenvironment. This technique is based on the 3D micropatterning of polyacrylamide wells and on the calculation of 3D traction force from their deformation. With 3D-TFM, we show that MCF10A breast epithelial cells exert defined, reproducible patterns of forces on their microenvironment, which can be both contractile and extensile. We further show that cells switch from a global contractile to extensile behaviour as their volume is reduced.

This has permitted the early detection of outbreaks but has been insufficient for single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-level analysis due to lower read accuracy than Illumina sequencing. This study aimed to determine whether Haplotype-aware ERRor cOrrection (HERRO) of ONT data could permit high-resolution comparison of outbreak isolates.

MethodsWe used ONT simplex reads from isolates involved in a recent outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in our neonatal unit. The raw sequence data were re-basecalled and adapter-trimmed using Dorado v0.7.0. The simplex reads then underwent HERRO correction. The resulting genome assemblies and phylogenies were compared with previous analyses (using Dorado v0.3.4, no HERRO correction and data generated by Illumina sequencing).

ResultsFive of nine outbreak isolates were included in the analysis. The remaining four isolates had insufficient read lengths (N50 values <10,000 bp) and did not provide complete chromosome coverage after HERRO correction. The average chromosome sequencing depth for nanopore data was 147x (range: 44-220x) with an average read N50 of 12,215 bp (interquartile range (IQR): 11,439-12,711 bp). The median pairwise SNV distance between outbreak isolates from the original investigation was 51 SNVs (range: 40-68), which decreased to 3 SNVs (range: 1-15) with HERRO correction. Illumina sequencing generated a median SNV distance of 2 (range: 0-13). The resulting standalone ONT HERRO-corrected phylogeny was almost indistinguishable from the standalone Illumina-generated phylogeny.

ConclusionsThe addition of HERRO correction meant isolates from this MRSA outbreak could be resolved to a level on par with Illumina sequencing. ONT data following HERRO correction represents a viable standalone option for high-resolution genomic analysis of hospital outbreaks, provided sufficient read lengths can be generated.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Much less is known about the evolutionary processes that shape the relationship between these two levels of gene expression. To disentangle the contributions of mutational and selective processes, we derive a novel phylogenetic model and fit it to multi-species data from mammalian skin tissue. We find that over macroevolutionary time: 1) there has been strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances; 2) mutations impacting mRNA abundances have minimal influence on protein abundances; 3) mRNA abundances are under selection to track protein abundances, and 4) mRNA abundances adapt more quickly than protein abundances due to increased mutational opportunity. We find additional support for these findings by comparing gene-specific parameter estimates from our model to human functional genomic data. More broadly, our new phylogenetic approach provides a foundation for testing hypotheses about the processes that led to divergence in gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

They are known to impact microbial community dynamics, microbial ecology, and evolution. Efforts to document the diversity, host range, infection dynamics, and effects of bacteriophage infection on host cell metabolism are extremely underexplored. Phages are classified as virulent or temperate based on their life cycles. Temperate phages adopt the lysogenic mode of infection, where the genome integrates into the host cell genome forming a prophage. Prophages enable viral genome replication without host cell lysis, and often contribute novel and beneficial traits to the host genome. Current phage research predominantly focuses on lytic phages, leaving a significant gap in knowledge regarding prophages, including their biology, diversity, and ecological roles.

ResultsHere we develop and describe Prophage-DB, a database of prophages, their proteins, and associated metadata that will serve as a resource for viral genomics and microbial ecology. To create the database, we identified and characterized prophages from genomes in three of the largest publicly available databases. We applied several state-of-the-art tools in our pipeline to annotate these viruses, cluster and taxonomically classify them, and detect their respective auxiliary metabolic genes. In total, we identify and characterize over 350,000 prophages and 35,000 auxiliary metabolic genes. Our prophage database is highly representative based on statistical results and contains prophages from a diverse set of archaeal and bacterial hosts which show a wide environmental distribution.

ConclusionProphages are particularly overlooked in viral ecology and merit increased attention due to their vital implications for microbiomes and their hosts. Here, we created Prophage-DB to advance our comprehension of prophages in microbiomes through a comprehensive characterization of prophages in publicly available genomes. We propose that Prophage-DB will serve as a valuable resource for advancing phage research, offering insights into viral taxonomy, host relationships, auxiliary metabolic genes, and environmental distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

We uncovered and experimentally confirmed striking positional preferences of TFs that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions, as well as a complex grammar of motif-motif interactions. For example, many, but not all, TFs act as repressors when their binding motif is located near or just downstream of the transcription start site.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1721340384790

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.

C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.

Here we evaluate a proposed feedforward and modular mapping of this process in rats: evidence accumulated in anterodorsal striatum (ADS) is categorized in prefrontal cortex (frontal orienting fields, FOF). Contrary to this, we show that both regions appear to be indistinguishable in their encoding/decoding of accumulator value and communicate this information bidirectionally. Consistent with a role for FOF in accumulation, silencing FOF to ADS projections impacted behavior throughout the accumulation period, even while nonselective FOF silencing did not. We synthesize these findings into a multi-region recurrent neural network trained with a novel approach. In-silico experiments reveal that multiple scales of recurrence in the cortico-striatal circuit rescue computation upon nonselective FOF perturbations. These results suggest that ADS and FOF accumulate evidence in a recurrent and distributed manner, yielding redundant representations and robustness to certain perturbations.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

We leverage whole-genome sequencing of >2600 plants across six continents to investigate the relative roles of colonization history and adaptation during the worldwide invasion of Trifolium repens. Introduced populations contain high levels of genetic variation with independent colonization histories evident on different continents. Five large structural variants on three chromosomes exist as standing genetic variation within the native range, and exhibit strong signatures of parallel climate-associated adaptation across continents. Common gardens in the native and introduced ranges demonstrate that three structural variants exhibit patterns of selection consistent with local adaptation across each range. Our results provide strong evidence that rapid and parallel adaptation during invasion is caused by large-effect structural variants introduced throughout the world.

Significance StatementBiological invasions occur over short timescales and introductions are often hypothesized to include limited genetic diversity, making the role of adaptation in invasion success controversial. We demonstrate that the invasion of a human-commensal species, Trifolium repens, likely stems from multiple, diverse introductions with significant evidence of climate-associated adaptation following introduction. The genetic basis of adaptation is most strongly linked to five chromosomal rearrangements that each span hundreds of genes - matching theoretical predictions that large-effect variants are key to the initial stages of adaptation to novel environments. Chromosomal rearrangements have remarkably parallel signatures of adaptation across different introductions despite initial colonization from different areas of Europe. Our study highlights the impact of globalization and rapid adaptation for the invasion success of human commensal species.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

To disentangle aging from physical activity-related mitochondrial adaptations, we functionally profiled skeletal muscle mitochondria in 51 inactive and 88 active men aged 20-93. Physical activity status conferred partial protection against age-related decline in physical performance. A trend for reduced muscle mitochondrial respiration with aging was observed in inactive but not in active participants, indicating that aging per se does not alter mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was unaffected by aging and active participants displayed higher ROS production. In contrast, mitochondrial calcium retention capacity decreased with aging regardless of physical activity status and correlated with muscle mass, performance and the stress-responsive metabokine GDF15. Targeting mitochondrial calcium handling may hold promise for treating aging-related muscle impairments.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

However, previous studies examining the mode in which species diversified, how diversification rates varied, and how ecological specialization affected these processes have found few different results across different taxa and geographic and ecological systems, showing how complex this process is. To gain a more complete picture of how species evolve, additional model systems that encompass alternative ecological requirements are needed. Here, we present the results of a study aimed to unravel the diversification mode and evolutionary drivers of the spider genus Dysdera, the red devil spiders, endemic to the Canary Islands. These species exhibit remarkable phenotypic variability in their mouthparts, which has been related to different levels of specialization in the predation of isopods. We explored patterns of linage diversification and assessed the role of trophic specialization as a driver of species diversification. Additionally, we used climatic variables, occurrence data and morphological information to unravel the underlying mode of speciation by means of joint species distribution models and age-range correlation methods. Our results reveal that red devil spiders underwent an early burst of diversification, followed by a slowdown of diversification rates, which is a hallmark of adaptive radiation. We also found evidence that the trophic morphology shaped diversification, with specialist species exhibiting higher rates of diversification. Finally, our analyses suggest that speciation occurred mostly in allopatry, with subsequent secondary sympatry following range expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Here we describe the rational conceptual design and test-case practical implementation of a photopharmacological paradigm to empower high-performance photomodulation studies in vivo. TRPC4/5 ion channels are involved in many spatiotemporally resolved circuits, from pain and anxiety, to reproductive signaling, digestion, and obesity. To unpick their biology requires spatiotemporally precise tools, which were lacking. We developed ""ideal efficacy photoswitch"" ligands to control their diverse functions in situ. These E{leftrightarrows}Z-photoswitchable ligands bias TRPC[4]/5 channel activity with exquisite photocontrol, from strong agonism under 360 nm, to low agonism at 385 nm, to strong antagonism at 410-460 nm. Cryo-EM structures of both TRPC4 and TRPC5 with both Z-agonists and E-antagonists support the rationale for efficacy switching through competitive E/Z isomer binding. Crucially, since the E/Z ratio is exclusively determined by the light wavelength applied, their channel photocontrol is exclusively wavelength-dependent, yet drug-concentration-independent: so is reproducible from cell culture to >millimetre-depth tissues. Indeed, we were able to photocontrol both direct and downstream TRPC4/5 biology in cell lines or primary cells in culture, from calcium flux, to primary neuron excitability and adrenaline release; and even in tissues, photoswitching small intestine motility and peristalsis. The TRPC4/5 ligands we develop will thus unlock a range of high-precision investigations in TRP biology. More broadly, we propose that the success of this efficacy photoswitch program, from concept to tissue level translation, is mainly a consequence of how biology has evolved proteins for efficacy control. We therefore foresee that a variety of functionally responsive protein targets, not only sensory and signaling ion channels and receptors, will be amenable to similarly high-performance photocontrol even in vivo, if a new generation of reagent development adopts this paradigm of ideal efficacy photoswitching.

However, the repetitive nature of TEs has hindered our understanding of their regulatory potential. Here, we demonstrate that long- read chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) permits the comprehensive annotation of the regulatory potential of maize TEs. We uncover that only 94 LTR retrotransposons contain the functional epigenetic architecture required for mobilization within maize leaves. This epigenetic architecture degenerates with evolutionary age, resulting in solo TE enhancers being preferentially marked by simultaneous hyper-CpG methylation and chromatin accessibility, an architecture markedly divergent from canonical enhancers. We find that TEs shape maize gene regulation by creating novel promoters within the TE itself as well as through TE-mediated gene amplification. Lastly, we uncover a pervasive epigenetic code directing TEs to specific loci, including that locus that sparked McClintocks discovery of TEs.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

They can learn to vocalize on command and the activity of single neurons from the crows associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal skilled behaviors. However, it remains unknown if specific anatomical adaptations that directly link the crow NCL to any of the nuclei of the crows ""song system"" exist. To address this issue, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods (Nissl-, myelin-, and anti tyrosine hydroxylase) to characterize the connectivity of the crows NCL in relation to its song system nuclei. We found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to and engulfing the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), which is the telencephalic motor output of the song system. Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum surrounding the basal ganglia song nucleus ""area X"". Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections--MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC--run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a ""general motor system"" that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Wheat resistance breeding frequently relies on the use of resistance (R) genes that encode diverse immune receptors which detect specific avirulence (AVR) effectors and subsequently induce an immune response. While R gene cloning has accelerated recently, AVR identification in many pathogens including Bgt lags behind, preventing pathogen-informed deployment of resistance sources. Here we describe a new ""avirulence depletion (AD) assay"" for rapid identification of AVR genes in Bgt. This assay relies on the selection of a segregating, haploid F1 progeny population on a resistant host, followed by bulk sequencing, thereby allowing rapid avirulence candidate gene identification with high mapping resolution. In a proof-of- concept experiment we mapped the AVR component of the wheat immune receptor Pm3a to a 25kb genomic interval in Bgt harboring a single effector, the previously described AvrPm3a2/f2. Subsequently, we applied the AD assay to map the unknown AVR effector recognized by the Pm60 immune receptor. We show that AvrPm60 is encoded by three tandemly arrayed, nearly identical effector genes that trigger an immune response upon co- expression with Pm60 and its alleles Pm60a and Pm60b. We furthermore provide evidence that Pm60 outperforms Pm60a and Pm60b through more efficient recognition of AvrPm60 effectors, suggesting it should be prioritized for wheat breeding. Finally, we show that virulence towards Pm60 is caused by simultaneous deletion of all AvrPm60 gene paralogs and that isolates lacking AvrPm60 are especially prevalent in the US thereby limiting the potential of Pm60 in this region. The AD assay is a powerful new tool for rapid and inexpensive AVR identification in Bgt with the potential to contribute to pathogen-informed breeding decisions for the use of novel R genes and regionally tailored gene deployment.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

The color set of a k-mer is the set of all identifiers, or colors, of the references that contain the k-mer. While these maps find countless applications in computational biology (e.g., basic query, reading mapping, abundance estimation, etc.), their memory usage represents a serious challenge for large-scale sequence indexing. Our solutions leverage on the intrinsic repetitiveness of the color sets when indexing large collections of related genomes. Hence, the described algorithms factorize the color sets into patterns that repeat across the entire collection and represent these patterns once, instead of redundantly replicating their representation as would happen if the sets were encoded as atomic lists of integers. Experimental results across a range of datasets and query workloads show that these representations substantially improve over the space effectiveness of the best previous solutions (sometimes, even dramatically, yielding indexes that are smaller by an order of magnitude). Despite the space reduction, these indexes only moderately impact the efficiency of the queries compared to the fastest indexes.

Serial sarcomere number (SSN) influences muscle mechanical function including the force-length and force-velocity-power relationships, and the age-related loss of SSN contributes to declining performance. Resistance training biased to active lengthening (eccentric) contractions increases SSN in young muscle, however, we showed maximal eccentric training in old rats did not alter SSN and further worsened performance. A submaximal eccentric training stimulus may be more conducive to adaptation for aged muscle. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether submaximal eccentric training can increase SSN and improve mechanical function in old rats. Twelve 32-month-old male F344/BN rats completed 4 weeks of submaximal (60% maximum) isokinetic eccentric plantar-flexion training 3 days/week. Pre- and post-training, we assessed in-vivo maximum isometric torque at a stretched and neutral ankle angle, the passive torque-angle relationship, and the isotonic torque-angular velocity-power relationship. The soleus and MG were harvested for SSN measurements via laser diffraction, with the untrained leg as a control. SSN increased 11% and 8%, and muscle wet weight increased 14% and 13% in the soleus and MG, respectively. Maximum isometric torque and shortening velocity were unaltered, but there was a shift towards longer muscle lengths for the optimal angle of torque production, a 42% reduction of passive torque, and 23% increase in peak isotonic power. Eccentric training at 60% maximum was beneficial for aged muscle, increasing SSN and muscle mass, reducing muscle passive tension, and improving dynamic performance.

In the absence of defined network junctions, the high conformational freedom of the molecules was previously theorized to confer unique mechanical properties to Olympic gels, such as non-linear elasticity and unconventional swelling characteristics. However, the synthesis of an Olympic gel exhibiting these intriguing features is challenging, since unintended crosslinking and polymerization processes are often favored over cyclization. Here, we report the successful assembly of a true Olympic gel from a library of DNA rings comprising more than 16,000 distinct molecules. Each of these rings contains a unique sequence domain that can be enzymatically activated to produce reactive termini that favor intramolecular cyclization. We characterized the materials genetic, mechanical, and structural characteristics by next-generation sequencing, oscillatory rheology, large-scale computational simulations, atomic force microscopy, and cryogenic electron microscopy. Our results confirm the formation of a stable Olympic gel, which exhibits unique swelling behavior and an elastic response that is exclusively determined by entanglements, yet persists on long time scales. By combining concepts from polymer physics, synthetic biology, and DNA nanotechnology, this new material class provides a flexible experimental platform for future studies into the effects of network topology on macroscopic material properties and its function as a carrier of genetic information in biological and biomimetic systems. This work moreover demonstrates that exotic material properties can emerge in systems with a high compositional complexity that is more reminiscent of biological than synthetic matter.

Here, we identified three cryptic lineages of Siderastrea siderea in Bocas del Toro, Panama that differ in distributions across inshore and offshore reefs, microbial associations, holobiont phenomes, and skeleton morphologies. A thermal variability experiment failed to increase thermal tolerance, but subsequent thermal challenge and recovery revealed one lineage maintained elevated energetic reserves, photochemical efficiency, and growth.

To understand the reasons behind these ecological differences, we need to obtain precise models for plasmid transmission dynamics. Here, we show that the dynamics of plasmid transmission follow a simple ecological model known as Hollings Type II Functional Response. Plasmid transmission dynamics can be faithfully captured using two parameters: the searching rate (the pace at which a donor bacterium encounters a suitable recipient) and the handling time (the time required for a donor to transfer the plasmid).

If fighting was essential to get access to mates and territory, then why did fights rarely lead to serious injury? Maynard Smith and Price developed game theory to show that limited war can be selected at the individual level. Owing to the explanatory potential of this first paper, and enabled by the elegant and powerful machinery of the soon-to-be-developed replicator dynamics [2, 3], EGT took off at an accelerated pace and began to shape expectations across systems and scales. But, even as it expanded its reach from animals to microbes [4-8] and from microbes to cancer [9-11], the field did not revisit a fundamental assumption of that first paper, which subsequently got weaved into the very fabric of the framework--that individual differences in reproduction are determined only by payoff from the game (i.e. in isolation, all individuals, regardless of strategy, were assumed to have identical intrinsic growth rates). Here, we argue that this original assumption substantially limits the scope of EGT. But, because it is not explicitly presented as a caveat, predictions of EGT have been empirically tested broadly across real systems, where the intrinsic growth rates are generally not equal. That has, unsurprisingly, led to puzzling findings and contentious debates [7, 12-15]. Flagging the high potential for confusion to arise from applications of EGT to empirical systems that it is not designed to study and suggesting a way forward constitute our main motivation for this work. In the process, we reestablish a dialog with ecology that can be fruitful both ways, e.g., by providing a so-far-elusive explanation for how diverse ecological communities can assemble evolutionarily.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

This inherent catalytic feature of condensates derives from the electrochemical environments and the electric fields at interfaces that are direct consequences of phase separation. The condensates we studied were capable of catalyzing diverse hydrolysis reactions, including hydrolysis and radical-dependent breakdown of ATP whereby ATP fully decomposes to adenine and multiple carbohydrates. This distinguishes condensates from naturally occurring ATPases, which can only catalyze the dephosphorylation of ATP. Interphase and interfacial properties of condensates can be tuned via sequence design, thus enabling control over catalysis through sequence-dependent electrochemical features of condensates. Incorporation of hydrolase-like synthetic condensates into live cells enables activation of transcriptional circuits that depend on products of hydrolysis reactions. Inherent catalytic functions of condensates, which are emergent consequences of phase separation, are likely to affect metabolic regulation in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface and to a new and highly relevant livestock species, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

The key component of this system, ParB, loads and spreads along DNA to form a local protein-DNA condensate known as a partition complex. As bacterial chromosomes are heavily supercoiled due to the continuous action of RNA polymerases, gyrases, and nucleoid-associated proteins, it is important to study the impact of DNA supercoiling on the ParB-DNA partition complex formation. Here, we use an in vitro single- molecule assay to visualize ParB on supercoiled DNA. Unlike most DNA-binding proteins, individual ParB proteins are found to not pin plectonemes on supercoiled DNA, but freely diffuse along supercoiled DNA. We find that DNA supercoiling enhances ParB-DNA condensation which initiates at lower ParB concentrations than on DNA that is torsionally relaxed. ParB proteins induce a DNA- protein condensate that strikingly absorbs all supercoiling writhe. Our findings provide mechanistic insights that have important implications for our understanding of bacterial chromosome organization and segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

However, reproducibility has not been systematically assessed within the context of electrophysiological recordings during cognitive behaviors. To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in ten laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1721340384790

Hodarchaeales (Asgardarchaeota class Heimdallarchaeia) were recently shown to be the closest relatives of eukaryotes. However, limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution1-3, including their anticipated role in eukaryogenesis. Here, we nearly double the number of Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to 869, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia (49 Hodarchaeales) and several novel lineages. Examining global distribution revealed Hodarcheales are primarily found in coastal marine sediments. Detailed analysis of their metabolic capabilities revealed guilds of Heimdallarchaeia are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmarks of aerobic eukaryotes, including electron transport chain complexes (III and IV), biosynthesis of heme, and response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The predicted structural architecture of Heimdallarchaeia membrane-bound hydrogenases includes additional Complex-I-like subunits potentially increasing the proton motive force and ATP synthesis. Heimdallarchaeia genomes encode CoxD, which regulates the electron transport chain (ETC) in eukaryotes. Thus, key hallmarks for aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. Moreover, we found that Heimdallarchaeia is present in a variety of oxic marine environments. This expanded diversity reveals these Archaea likely conferred energetic advantages during early stages of eukaryogenesis, fueling cellular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384790

Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384791

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1721340384791
