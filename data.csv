We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy. Design and Methods: Scopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group). Results: 122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses. Conclusions: BMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1718575698801

However, mechanisms of venom action remain poorly understood. Here, we show that infection of host Drosophila by the endoparasitoid wasp, Asobara japonica, triggers imaginal disc degradation (IDD) by inducing apoptosis, autophagy, and mitotic arrest, leading to impaired host metamorphosis. A multi-omics approach identified two venom proteins of A. japonica necessary for IDD. Knockdown experiments targeting the venom genes revealed that in concert with host immune suppression, IDD is essential for successful parasitism. Our study highlights a venom-mediated hijacking strategy of the parasitoid wasp that allows host larvae to grow, but ultimately kills the hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

To circumvent the systemic adverse effects of T3/T4, we have asked in the current pilot study whether topically applied T3/T4 retains hair growth-promoting properties. To prove this, we have topically treated healthy full-thickness human scalp skin with T3 (1, 10nM) and T4 (1, 10M) for six days in serum-free organ culture, using an HF-targeting vehicle that contains only FDA-approved ingredients. This showed that, at distinct doses, topical T3 and T4 significantly increased the percentage of HFs in anagen, decreased the percentage of proliferative (Ki-67+) cells in the hair matrix, did not promote melanogenesis (as measured by quantitative Warthin-Starry histochemistry), and significantly increased keratin 15 expression in the bulge. Finally, T3 and T4, at low concentrations, increase the expression of the hair growth promoters IGF-1 and FGF-7. The lower concentration of T3 and both of T4 also significantly increases the number of CD31+ endothelial cells, suggesting a pro-angiogenic effect, which is also important for hair growth promotion. These preliminary results strongly suggest that topically applied thyroid hormones promote hair growth in intact human scalp on multiple levels ex vivo. This invites the intermittent pulse application of topical T3 and T4 as a novel therapeutic intervention for managing hair loss disorders associated with telogen effluvium, such as androgenetic alopecia.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

We demonstrate that SCC-DBS has a selective effect on white matter macro- and micro-structure in the cingulum bundle distant to where stimulation was delivered. SCC-DBS also decreased functional connectivity between subcallosal and posterior cingulate cortex, two areas linked by the cingulum bundle and implicated in depression.

Generating training data requires intense human effort to annotate each instance of an object across serial section images. Our focus is on the especially complicated brain neuropil, comprising an extensive interdigitation of dendritic, axonal, and glial processes visualized through serial section electron microscopy. We developed a novel deep learning-based method to generate dense 3D segmentations rapidly from sparse 2D annotations of a few objects on single sections. Models trained on the rapidly generated segmentations achieved similar accuracy as those trained on expert dense ground-truth annotations. Human time to generate annotations was reduced by three orders of magnitude and could be produced by non-expert annotators. This capability will democratize generation of training data for large image volumes needed to achieve brain circuits and measures of circuit strengths.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

However, small invertebrates often consume incredibly small amounts of food. This renders traditional methods, such as weighing individuals before and after food acquisition, either inaccurate or prohibitively expensive. Here, we present a non-invasive method to quantify food consumption of small invertebrates whose body expands during feeding. Using the markerless pose estimation software DeepLabCut, we three-dimensionally track the body of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile. Using these extracted markers, we developed an algorithm which computationally reconstructs the ant's body, directly measuring volumetric change over time. Moreover, we provide measures of accuracy and quantify the ant's feeding response to a range of sucrose concentrations, as well as a gradient of caffeine-laced sucrose solutions. Small invertebrates are often prolific invasive species and disease vectors, causing significant ecological and economical damage. Understanding their feeding behaviour could be an important step towards effective control strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

FACT also interacts with a specialized centromeric nucleosome containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A and with CENP-TW, two subunits of CCAN, a 16-protein complex associated with CENP-A. The significance of these interactions remains elusive. Here, we show that FACT has multiple additional binding sites on CCAN. The interaction with CCAN is strongly stimulated by casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation of FACT. Mitotic localization of FACT to kinetochores is strictly dependent on specific CCAN subcomplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that DNA readily displaces FACT from CCAN, suggesting that FACT becomes recruited through a pool of CCAN that is not stably integrated into chromatin. Collectively, our results point to a potential role of FACT in chaperoning CCAN during transcription or in the stabilization of CCAN at the centromere during the cell cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Descendants of local Khoe-San and Bantu-speaking populations, European settlers, and enslaved individuals from Africa and Asia, SAC individuals embody diverse ancestries. This study investigates the genetic makeup of SAC individuals, utilizing autosomal genotypes, mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome data. We analyze new genotype data for 125 SAC individuals from seven locations. Our analysis, based on a dataset comprising 356 SAC individuals from 22 geographic locations, revealed significant regional variations in ancestry. Khoe-San ancestry predominates in 14 locations, highlighting its lasting influence. Inland regions exhibit higher proportions of Khoe-San ancestry, eastern regions show more Bantu-speaker/West African ancestry, and western/coastal areas, particularly around Cape Town, display increased Asian ancestry. These patterns reflect historical migrations and settlement patterns. Additionally, sex-biased admixture ratios show male-biased admixture from East Africans and Europeans, and female-biased admixture from Khoe-San populations, which is supported by mitochondrial and Y-chromosome data. This research underscores the importance of studying the SAC population to understand South Africa's historical migrations, providing insights into the complex genetic heritage of South Africans.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Wolbachia strains transferred from other insects to mosquitoes can be released to combat dengue transmission by blocking virus replication and spreading through populations, but host fitness costs imposed by Wolbachia, particularly under some environments, can impede spread. We therefore assessed the impact of two Wolbachia strains being released for dengue control (wAlbB and wMelM) on fecundity and egg viability following extended egg retention (12 or 18 d) under laboratory conditions. Egg viability decreased to a greater extent in females carrying wMelM compared to uninfected or wAlbB females. Fertility fully recovered in uninfected females following a second blood meal after laying retained eggs, while wMelM females experienced only partial recovery. Effects of wMelM on egg retention were similar regardless of whether females were crossed to uninfected or wMelM males, suggesting that fitness costs were triggered by Wolbachia presence in females. The fecundity and hatch proportions of eggs of wMelM females declined with age, regardless of whether females used stored sperm or were recently inseminated. Costs of some Wolbachia strains during egg retention may affect the invasion and persistence of Wolbachia in release sites where larval habitats are scarce and/or intermittent.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Despite its importance, both the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins of this variability remain largely unknown due to the mixed contributions of cis- and trans-acting elements. To address this issue, we focused on the mutational variability of cis-acting elements, that is, promoter regions, in Escherichia coli. Random mutations were introduced into the natural and synthetic promoters to generate mutant promoter libraries. By comparing the variance in promoter activity of these mutant libraries, we found no significant difference in mutational variability in promoter activity between promoter groups, suggesting the absence of a signature of natural selection for mutational robustness. In contrast, the promoters controlling essential genes exhibited a remarkable bias in mutational variability, with mutants displaying higher activities than the wild types being relatively rare compared to those with lower activities. Our evolutionary simulation on a rugged fitness landscape provided a rationale for this vulnerability. These findings suggest that bias in mutational variability in promoters may constrain the evolution of downstream essential genes toward higher expression levels.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718575698801

Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean.

Although post-transcriptional modifications of these non-coding RNAs are common in many systems, chloroplast tRNA and rRNA modifications are not well characterised. In this study, we investigated the post-transcriptional modifications in chloroplast tRNAs and rRNAs of Arabidopsis thaliana using tRNA sequencing, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, targeted rRNA sequencing, and analysis of public data. Our results revealed similarities between chloroplast non-coding RNAs and bacterial systems (e.g., Escherichia coli), such as modification patterns at the anticodon-adjacent position and the variable loop of tRNAs, along with conserved modifications in the small subunit rRNA. Additionally, we identified features shared with eukaryotic systems that likely contribute to the correct three-dimensional structure of chloroplast tRNAs. Unique modifications were also discovered, including a potential novel modification at wobble position in tRNA-IleCAU, which may be crucial for distinguishing isoleucine codons from methionine codons, and chloroplast-specific rRNA modifications that likely compensate for altered ribosome structure. These findings suggest that the chloroplast translation machinery, through co-evolution with its eukaryotic host, has adopted features beyond those typically found in bacteria, reflecting a blend of ancestral and acquired characteristics.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

In this study, we introduce isoLASER, a computational method leveraging long-read RNA-seq data to distinguish splicing events predominantly influenced by cis- or trans-regulatory mechanisms. IsoLASER computes the adjusted mutual information between haplotypes and exonic segments, and sensitively identifies allele-specific splicing events compared to transcript-level approaches. Using isoLASER, we identified 2,047 and 4,679 unique exonic regions exhibiting cis-directed splicing in human and mouse data respectively. Moreover, applied to a small number of samples jointly, isoLASER reveals splicing-associated variants that were only identifiable using large sample cohorts in previous association studies. Importantly, isoLASER enables HLA typing using long-read RNA-seq alone and uncovers allele-specific splicing of HLA genes. In brain tissues, we identified variants linked to splicing in Alzheimer`s disease-relevant genes such as MAPT, BIN1 and MS4A6A. Together, we establish a framework for identifying genetically and non-genetically driven splicing and associated variants, particularly in cohorts with limited sample sizes.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Here, we generated an ancient DNA time transect consisting of 219 individuals with genome-wide data from 47 sites in this region, supplemented by 97 new radiocarbon dates. Spanning from the Early Bronze Age 5000 years ago to the so-called ""Migration Period"" that followed the fall of the Western Roman Empire, we document a largely persisting local gene pool that continuously assimilated migrants from Anatolia/Levant and the populations of the adjacent Eurasian steppe. More specifically, we observe these admixture events as early as the Middle Bronze Age. Starting with Late Antiquity (late first century AD), we also detect an increasing number of individuals with more southern ancestry, more frequently associated with urban centers - landmarks of the early Christianization in eastern Georgia. Finally, in the Early Medieval Period starting 400 AD, we observe genetic outlier individuals with ancestry from the Central Eurasian steppe, with artificial cranial deformations (ACD) in several cases. At the same time, we reveal that many individuals with ACD descended from native South Caucasus groups, indicating that the local population likely adopted this cultural practice.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

We conjecture that the competitive environment of a football game leads to movement dynamics reminiscent of that observed in hunter-gathering populations and more broadly in any biological organisms foraging for resources, whose exact distribution is unknown to them. Apart from analyzing individual players' movements, we investigate the dynamics of the whole team by studying the movements of its center of mass (team's centroid).

Here, we study how different rhythm structures of the musical signal can guide the temporal dynamics of auditory oscillations phase-aligned to the speech envelope. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of prior exposure to rhythmically structured musical sequences on cortical tracking of speech in Basque-Spanish bilingual adults. We conducted two EEG experiments where participants were presented with sentences in Basque and Spanish preceded by musical sequences that differed in their beat structure. The beat structure of the musical sequences was created to 1) reflect and match the syllabic structure of the sentences, 2) reflect a regular rhythm but not match the syllabic structure of the sentences, and 3) follow an irregular rhythm. First, we showed that the regularity found in the rhythmic structure of music acts as a temporal guide for brain oscillations. Second, our findings suggest that not only the regularity in music is crucial but so is adjusting this regularity to optimally reflect the rhythmic characteristics of the language. Third, despite finding some differences across frequencies for each language, we still found a strong effect of rhythm regularity on cortical tracking of speech. We showed that rhythm, inherent in musical signals, guides the adaptation of brain oscillations, by adapting the temporal dynamics of the oscillatory activity to the rhythmic scaffolding of the musical signal.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

These infections often manifest as vaginal discharge and can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Traditional antibiotic treatments are increasingly challenged by the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains, underscoring the need for alternative therapies. This study aimed to isolate and identify microorganisms from vaginal swab samples and evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of clove (Eugenia caryophyllata) extracts against these isolates. Using CLED agar, nutrient agar, and Sabouraud dextrose agar, a diverse range of bacterial and fungal flora were isolated from eight vaginal swab samples. The primary bacterial isolates included Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus spp., while Candida albicans was the main fungal isolate. Biochemical tests confirmed the identity of these microorganisms. The study found that ethanol clove extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values being 20 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml, respectively. Additionally, ciprofloxacin, used as a control antibiotic, showed maximum inhibition against Lactobacillus spp., highlighting a potential risk for disrupting beneficial vaginal flora when using conventional antibiotics. The findings suggest that ethanol clove extract could serve as an effective alternative antimicrobial agent, reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance and preserving the balance of the vaginal microbiome. This research emphasizes the importance of exploring plant-based antimicrobial agents as viable alternatives to traditional antibiotics. The significant antimicrobial properties of clove extract against common vaginal pathogens offer promising implications for future therapeutic applications in managing vaginal infections.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

We now show Mest digit expression is regeneration-specific and not upregulated in post-amputation fibrosing proximal digits. Mest homozygous knockout mice exhibit delayed bone regeneration though no phenotype is found in paternal knockout mice, inconsistent with the defined maternal genomic imprinting of Mest. We demonstrate that promoter switching, not loss of imprinting, regulates biallelic Mest expression in the blastema and does not occur during embryogenesis, indicating a regeneration-specific mechanism. Requirement for Mest expression is tied to modulating neutrophil response, as revealed by scRNAseq and FACS comparing wildtype and knockout blastemas. Collectively, the imprinted gene Mest is required for proper digit tip regeneration and its blastema expression is facilitated by promoter switching for biallelic expression.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

These gradients provide crucial insight into the relationship between the brain's topographic organization and the texture of human cognition. However, no studies to date have charted how intrinsic FC gradient architecture develops across the entire human lifespan. In this work, we model developmental trajectories of the three primary gradients of FC using a large, high-quality, and temporally-dense functional MRI dataset spanning from birth to 100 years of age. The gradient axes, denoted as sensorimotor-association (SA), visual-somatosensory (VS), and modulation-representation (MR), encode crucial hierarchical organizing principles of the brain in development and aging. By tracking their evolution throughout the human lifespan, we provide the first ever comprehensive low-dimensional normative reference of global FC hierarchical architecture. We observe significant age-related changes in global network features, with global markers of hierarchical organization increasing from birth to early adulthood and decreasing thereafter. During infancy and early childhood, FC organization is shaped by primary sensory processing, dense short-range connectivity, and immature association and control hierarchies. Functional differentiation of transmodal systems supported by long-range coupling drives a convergence toward adult-like FC organization during late childhood, while adolescence and early adulthood are marked by the expansion and refinement of SA and MR hierarchies. While gradient topographies remain stable during late adulthood and aging, we observe decreases in global gradient measures of FC differentiation and complexity from 30 to 100 years. Examining cortical microstructure gradients alongside our functional gradients, we observed that structure-function gradient coupling undergoes differential lifespan trajectories across multiple gradient axes.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Recent studies have highlighted that bacteria possess a large, rapidly changing arsenal of defense genes and that viruses can neutralize at least some of these genes with matching anti-defenses. However, a broadly applicable approach for discovering the genetic underpinnings of such interactions is missing since typically used methods such as comparative genomics are limited by the rampant horizontal gene transfer and poor annotation of viral and bacterial genes. Here we show that genes that allow the viruses to overcome bacterial defenses can be systematically identified using an interpretable machine-learning approach even when using diverse bacteria-virus infection data. To verify the predictions, we experimentally characterized eight previously unknown anti-defense proteins in viruses specific for Vibrio bacteria and showed that they counteract a wide range of bacterial immune systems, including AbiH, AbiU, Septu, DRT, CBASS, and Retron. The power of our computational approach is highlighted by the identification of anti-defense proteins that inhibit non-homologous defense systems, which we verify for Retron and AbiH. We suggest that the computational prediction based on experimental interactions offers a promising avenue to unravel the genetic mechanisms of co-evolution between bacteria and their viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

We find that physiologically relevant and disease-associated repeat RNAs spontaneously undergo an age-dependent percolation transition inside multi-component protein-nucleic acid condensates to form nanoscale clusters. Homotypic RNA clusters drive the emergence of multiphasic condensate structures with an RNA-rich solid core surrounded by an RNA-depleted fluid shell. The timescale of the RNA clustering, which drives a liquid-to-solid transition of biomolecular condensates, is determined by the sequence features, stability of RNA secondary structure, and repeat length. Importantly, G3BP1, the core scaffold of stress granules, introduces heterotypic buffering to homotypic RNA-RNA interactions and impedes intra-condensate RNA clustering in an ATP-independent manner. Our work suggests that biomolecular condensates can act as sites for RNA aggregation. It also highlights the functional role of RNA-binding proteins in suppressing aberrant RNA phase transitions.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Here we examined the degree to which NRC proteins from multiple Solanaceae species are sensitive to suppression by SS15 and tested hypotheses about adaptive evolution of the binding interface between the SS15 inhibitor and NRC proteins. Whereas all tested orthologs of NRC2 were inhibited by SS15, some natural variants of NRC1 and NRC3 are insensitive to SS15 suppression. Ancestral sequence reconstruction combined with functional assays revealed that NRC3 transitioned from an ancestral suppressed form to an insensitive one over 19 million years ago. Our analyses revealed the evolutionary trajectory of coevolution between a parasite inhibitor and its NLR immune receptor target, identifying key evolutionary transitions in helper NLRs that counteract this inhibition.

Whether obesity is associated with an increased risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-Cov-2 infection (PASC) among pediatrics, independent of its impacts on acute infection severity, is unclear. OBJECTIVE To quantify the association between body mass index (BMI) status before SARS-CoV-2 infection and pediatric PASC risk, controlling for acute infection severity. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study occurred from March 2020 to May 2023, with a minimal follow-up of 179 days. SETTING Twenty-six US hospitals. PARTICIPANTS Individuals aged 5-20 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection. EXPOSURES Elevated BMI status assessed before infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES To identify PASC, we first used the ICD-10-CM code specific for post-COVID-19 conditions, and a second approach used clusters of symptoms and conditions that constitute the PASC phenotype. BMI was assessed within 18 months before infection; the measure closest to the index date was selected. Relative risk (RR) for BMI-PASC association was quantified by Poisson regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic, acute COVID severity, and other clinical factors. RESULTS Among the 172136 participants included, the median age of BMI assessment and cohort entry were 12.8 and 13.2 years, 1402 (0.8%) were identified as having PASC with the ICD-10-CM code, and 74317 (43.2%) had more than 1 incident occurrence of PASC symptoms and conditions. Compared with participants with a healthy weight, those who had overweight, obesity, and severe obesity had 4.7% (RR, 1.047; 95% CI, 0.868-1.263), 25.4% (RR, 1.254; 95% CI, 1.064-1.478) and 42.1% (RR, 1.421; 95% CI, 1.253-1.611) higher risk of PASC when identified using the diagnosis code, respectively. The risk for any occurrences of PASC symptoms and conditions also increased in overweight (RR, 1.030; 95% CI, 0.982-1.080), obesity (RR, 1.108; 95% CI, 1.064-1.154), and severe obesity (RR, 1.174; 95% CI, 1.138-1.213), and that for total incident occurrences increased, too, in overweight (RR, 1.053; 95% CI, 1.000-1.109), obesity (RR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.088-1.188), and severe obesity (RR, 1.182; 95% CI, 1.142-1.223). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Elevated BMI was associated with a significantly increased PASC risk in a dose-dependent manner. The biological mechanisms for this association should be investigated in future research.","NA","medrxiv",1718575698801

To examine this, we co-administered psilocybin (25 mg) with the amnestic benzodiazepine midazolam in 8 healthy participants and assayed the subjective quality of, and memory for, the dosing-day experience. We identified a midazolam dose that allowed a conscious psychedelic experience to occur while partially impairing memory for the experience. Furthermore, midazolam dose and memory impairment tended to associate inversely with salience, insight, and well-being induced by psilocybin. These data suggest a role for memory in therapeutically relevant behavioral effects occasioned by psilocybin. Because midazolam blocks memory by blocking cortical neural plasticity, it may also be useful for evaluating the contribution of the pro-neuroplastic properties of psychedelics to their therapeutic activity.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

However, several psychophysical studies found no compelling association between these illusions, calling this hypothesis into question. Here we ask if these discrepant reports could arise from methodological differences between these studies. We ran a battery of visual size illusion and basic discrimination tasks with carefully matched geometric properties, using a classical forced choice design. Ebbinghaus and Delboeuf illusion magnitudes are strongly correlated, consistent with the idea that they reflect the same underlying mechanism. Ponzo illusion magnitude also correlates with these two illusions, despite to a lesser extent, indicative that both shared and independent factors govern these illusions. Interestingly, the classical arrowhead version of the Mueller-Lyer illusion does not correlate with any of the other illusions or the ability to discriminate line length. This suggests that an altogether separate process underlies this perceptual effect. We further demonstrate that presenting stimuli briefly with central fixation critically affects measurements of the Ebbinghaus illusion. Taken together, our findings therefore highlight the importance of experimental parameters when probing relationships between perceptual effects and their links to neural processing.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Tyrannosaurus rex top speeds have been examined using a wide range of methods that draw on more traditional biomechanical formulas, computer simulations, and allometric equations based on mass. However, these calculations may be made more precise using input from contemporary research on anatomy and biomechanics that account for mass allometry and scaling. This study builds on existing studies in anatomy, biomechanical data, and established equations for locomotion to calculate a muscular driven range of top speed for several (n=4) specimens that had sufficient data to undertake this work. When properly refined with additional data on muscle mass allometry and scaling, several adult specimens of T. rex could confidently be placed in a range of top speed from 7.7 to 10.5 m/s, and possibly up to 10.7 m/s. Additionally, a younger specimen of T. rex was analyzed and found to have a higher top speed than the adult T. rex at 6.3 to 14.5 m/s. Although the estimated top speeds in this study are slower than some previous estimates, these results find some support for slow running gaits and reinforce interpretations of T. rex as an active and effective apex predator. Future work can build upon this study by investigating how muscular driven top speeds may affect ontogenetic niche partitioning and prey species regularly targeted by adult T. rex.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Through an integrative approach combining culture-dependent methods and long-read amplicon sequencing, we demonstrate cultivar-dependent taxonomic and functional microdiversity of the rhizocompetent and bioactive Pseudomonas genus associated with Fusarium-resistant versus susceptible winter wheat cultivars. The resistant cultivar demonstrated increased Pseudomonas taxonomic but not biosynthetic diversity when compared to the susceptible cultivar, correlating with a thinner root diameter of the resistant cultivar. We found enrichment of antifungal Pseudomonas isolates, genes (chitinase), and biosynthetic gene clusters (pyoverdine) in the resistant cultivar.

Here, we investigate the performance of a wide range of PRS models across four ancestry groups (Africans, Europeans, East Asians, and South Asians) for 14 conditions of high-medical interest. Methods: To select the best-performing model per trait, we first compared PRS performances for publicly available scores, and constructed new models using different methods (LDpred2, PRS-CSx and SNPnet). We used 285K European individuals from the UK Biobank (UKBB) for training and 18K, including diverse ancestries, for testing. We then evaluated PRS portability for the best models in Europeans and compared their accuracies with respect to the best PRS per ancestry. Finally, we validated the selected PRS models using an independent set of 8,417 individuals from Biobank of the Americas-Genomelink (BBofA-GL); and performed a PRS-Phewas. Results: We confirmed a decay in PRS performances relative to Europeans when the evaluation was conducted using the best-PRS model for Europeans (51.3% for South Asians, 46.6% for East Asians and 39.4% for Africans). We observed an improvement in the PRS performances when specifically selecting ancestry specific PRS models (phenotype variance increase: 1.62 for Africans, 1.40 for South Asians and 0.96 for East Asians). Additionally, when we selected the optimal model conditional on ancestry for CAD, HDL-C and LDL-C, hypertension, hypothyroidism and T2D, PRS performance for studied populations was more comparable to what was observed in Europeans. Finally, we were able to independently validate tested models for Europeans, and conducted a PRS-Phewas, identifying cross-trait interplay between cardiometabolic conditions, and between immune-mediated components. Conclusion: Our work comprehensively evaluated PRS accuracy across a wide range of phenotypes, reducing the uncertainty with respect to which PRS model to choose and in which ancestry group. This evaluation has let us identify specific conditions where implementing risk-prioritization strategies could have practical utility across diverse ancestral groups, contributing to democratizing the implementation of PRS.","NA","medrxiv",1718575698801

The problem has accordingly been considered ill-posed. We hypothesize that similarity judgments may be, in a sense, metacognitive: The stimuli rated as subjectively similar are those that are in fact more challenging for oneself to discern in practice, in near-threshold settings (e.g., psychophysics experiments). This self-knowledge about one's own perceptual capacities provides a quasi-objective ground truth as to whether two stimuli should be judged as similar. To test this idea, we measure perceptual discrimination capacity between face pairs, and ask subjects to rank the similarity between them. Based on pilot data, we hypothesize a positive association between perceptual discrimination capacity and subjective dissimilarity, with this association being importantly specific to each individual.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

The incomplete understanding of the molecular disease mechanisms results in lacking treatment options, leading to high mortality amongst patients. Here, using an inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific lamin A/C depletion mouse model, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic study, combining both bulk and single nucleus RNA sequencing, and spanning LMNA-DCM disease progression, to identify potential disease drivers. Our refined analysis pipeline identified 496 genes already misregulated early in disease. The expression of these genes was largely driven by disease specific cardiomyocyte sub-populations and involved biological processes mediating cellular response to DNA damage, cytosolic pattern recognition, and innate immunity. Indeed, DNA damage in LMNA-DCM hearts was significantly increased early in disease and correlated with reduced cardiomyocyte lamin A levels. Activation of cytosolic pattern recognition in cardiomyocytes was independent of cGAS, which is rarely expressed in cardiomyocytes, but likely occurred downstream of other pattern recognition sensors such as IFI16. Altered gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts and immune cell infiltration further contributed to tissue-wide changes in gene expression. Our transcriptomic analysis further predicted significant alterations in cell-cell communication between cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and immune cells, mediated through early changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the LMNA-DCM hearts. Taken together, our work suggests a model in which nuclear damage in cardiomyocytes leads to activation of DNA damage responses, cytosolic pattern recognition pathway, and other signaling pathways that activate inflammation, immune cell recruitment, and transcriptional changes in cardiac fibroblasts, which collectively drive LMNA-DCM pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Combining Phollow with optically transparent zebrafish enabled us to directly visualize phage outbreaks within the vertebrate gut. We observed that virions can be rapidly taken up by intestinal tissues, including by enteroendocrine cells, and quickly disseminate to extraintestinal sites, including the liver and brain. Moreover, antibiotics trigger waves of interbacterial transmission leading to sudden shifts in spatial organization and composition of defined gut communities. Phollow ultimately empowers multiscale investigations connecting phage transmission to transkingdom interactions that have the potential to open new avenues for viral-based microbiome therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

In the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), fast oscillations (sharp-wave ripples) during non-REM sleep consolidate spatial memories through place cell reactivation. The hippocampal formation is heterogeneous; the dHPC processes mostly contextual information, while the ventral part (vHPC) encodes valence and anxiety. We propose that dorsal-ventral communication during sleep is involved in the consolidation of emotional memories, potentially integrating or segregating contextual and valence information. To test this, we recorded the electrophysiological activity in the dHPC and vHPC in rats during reward and aversion-motivated exploration of a linear track and subsequent sleep. We detected dorsal and ventral SWRs during NREM sleep as well as neuronal assemblies during each exploration type and identified dorsal, ventral, and joint (dorso-ventral) assemblies. We found that dorso-ventral hippocampal coordination involves coordinated ripples and bursts of ripples. Aversive joint assemblies exhibited higher reactivation during non-REM sleep than the joint assemblies from the reward condition. Interestingly, joint aversive assemblies reactivated selectively during dorso-ventral coordinated ripples. Furthermore, their reactivation strength positively correlated with their strength of activation during the task. These results suggest the existence of dorsal-ventral hippocampal functional communication capable of sustaining the selective reactivation of experiences based on their emotional valence.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

The most abundant viral factor in latently infected cells is not a protein but a noncoding RNA called EBV-encoded RNA 1 (EBER1). Even though EBER1 is highly abundant and was discovered over forty years ago, the function of EBER1 has remained elusive. EBER1 interacts with the ribosomal protein L22, which normally suppresses the expression of its paralog L22-like 1 (L22L1). Here we show that when L22 binds EBER1, it cannot suppress L22L1, resulting in L22L1 being expressed and incorporated into ribosomes. We further show that L22L1-containing ribosomes preferentially translate mRNAs involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Moreover, upregulation of L22L1 is indispensable for growth transformation and immortalization of resting B cells upon EBV infection. Taken together, our results suggest that the function of EBER1 is to modulate host gene expression at the translational level, thus bypassing the need for dysregulating host gene transcription.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Conventional matrices used for hormone assessment include blood serum, saliva, urine and faeces, typically involving invasive human-animal interaction, which is known to initiate an acute stress response and thus confound studies assessing cortisol. As such, these matrices are most appropriate as short-term, point measures as they reflect circulating concentrations at the level of the minute and hour. Alternatively, non-invasive hair and wool assessment offer long-term, historic reflections of hormone concentration at the scale of weeks and months and are not limited by sampling stress thus making wool an appropriate tissue for hormone analysis. This pilot study quantified cortisol and testosterone concentrations of ram fleece and determine if there is a significant difference between segments of the sample staple, and whether there is a correlation between hormones. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid produced within the adrenal glands and secreted in anticipation of or in response to a stressor. Testosterone is an androgen mainly synthesised within the testes of males and responsible for several critical functions including regulation of muscle growth, libido and spermatogenesis. In our study, 70 topknot wool samples were collected from rams on a commercial stud property in Dirranbandi, Queensland, Australia. Of these animals, 12 samples were selected at random to undergo cortisol and testosterone quantification. In the laboratory, a single, intact staple was isolated from the total sample, divided into 10 mm segments and prepared for their respective (cortisol or testosterone) immunoassays. No significant difference (p>0.05) was found between wool segments for either cortisol or testosterone, however, statistical differences (p<0.05) were found between individuals for both hormones. A strong correlation (R2=0.9173) was found between wool cortisol and testosterone concentrations, which was a first-time discovery in rams. Furthermore, climate loggers (n=6) were installed in proximity to the rams to collect daily maximum temperature (oC) and relative humidity (RH%) data to calculate the temperature-humidity index (THI) as an indicator of potential heat stress. Under this method, rams were deemed comfortable at a THI<72; under mild stress at a THI of between 72 and 78; moderate stress between 79 and 80 and severe stress at a THI of >81. Mean weekly THI peaked in late summer (February), remained high in early autumn (March), decreased throughout the remainder of autumn and the duration of winter before increasing slightly as temperatures rose in early spring (September). Over the trial, 90.36% or 4,706 h were marked by comfortable conditions, 8.95% or 466 h by mild stress, 0.60% or 31 h by moderate, and 0.10% or 5 h by severe stress. It was determined that THI is most valuable when combined with other methods of measuring heat stress, including non-invasive wool hormone assessment. Whilst most of the findings in this study were previously confirmed by other studies, the strong correlation between wool cortisol and testosterone concentrations appears to be a first. In summary, this study reveals the major future possibilities for non-invasive wool hormone assessment and the possible applications of combining this with temperature-humidity index scores to provide further insight into heat stress within the context of production animal agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Here, we identify a novel stress response pathway activated by mitochondrial damage that regulates mitophagy in neurons. We find that increasing levels of mitochondrial stress triggers a graded, concerted response that induces proteasomal degradation of negative regulators of autophagy. These include Myotubularin-related phosphatase 5 (MTMR5), MTMR2 and Rubicon. This Mitophagic Stress Response (MitoSR) pathway is neuron-specific and acts in parallel to the classical Pink1/Parkin mediated mitophagy pathway. While MTMR5/MTMR2 inhibits autophagosome biogenesis, we find that Rubicon inhibits lysosomal function and thus blocks autophagosome maturation. Targeted depletion of these negative regulators is sufficient to enhance mitophagy, promoting autophagosome biogenesis and facilitating the fusion of mitophagosomes with lysosomes. Our work suggests that therapeutic activation of the MitoSR pathway to induce degradation of negative regulators of autophagy may enhance mitochondrial quality control in stressed neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

The dynamics of a GPCR interactome as it evolves over time and space in response to an agonist can offer a unique window on pleiotropic signaling decoding and functional selectivity at a cellular level. In this study, we employed proximity-based APEX2 proteomics to interrogate the interaction network of the GPCR for luteinizing hormone (LHR) on a sub-minute timescale. We developed an analytical approach integrating quantitative multiplexed proteomics and temporal reference profiles, providing a platform to identify the proteomic environment of APEX2-tagged LHR at the nanometer scale. LHR activity is exquisitely regulated at a spatial level, leading to identification of novel interactors including the Ras-related GTPase RAP2B that modulate both receptor signaling and post-endocytic trafficking, and providing a resource for spatiotemporal nanodomain mapping of LHR interactors across subcellular compartments.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Given the paucity of approved therapeutic strategies for this lifestyle disorder, dietary interventions may prove effective. We evaluated how green jackfruit flour (JF) prevents MASH and progression to HCC and its underlying mechanisms. The study utilized two murine models that mimicked human MASLD disease: (i) a diet-induced MASH model; (ii) a MASH-HCC model induced by diet and a very low dose of CCl4. C57Bl/6 mice were fed with chow (CD) or western diet (WD) with normal (NW) or sugar water (SW) for 12 weeks, then randomized to receive either 5 kcal% green jackfruit flour (JF) or an equal volume of placebo flour (PB). The biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses were assessed. JF significantly reduced body weight, liver injury, insulin resistance, and alleviated obesity, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development in WDSW or WDSW/CCl4 mice compared to placebo groups. Furthermore, JF activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibited MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways in MASH and MASH-HCC experimental models, respectively. This was supported by sodium propionate treatment, the primary short-chain fatty acid entering the liver from JFs soluble fiber microbial fermentation, which also regulated AMPK and MAPK signaling in cellular models of MASH and HCC, respectively. Hence, our findings present strong evidence of JFs therapeutic potential in the prevention of MASH and MASH-HCC, warranting further investigation of JFs efficacy as a dietary intervention in clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

In the present study, the mRNA transcriptome of phorbol ester (TPA) differentiated HL-60/S4 macrophage cells was scrutinized using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which evaluates the strengths of various cellular phenotypes by examining the enrichment of functionally different gene sets. Employing GSEA, we obtained supporting evidence that HL-60/S4 macrophages are senescent, probably a consequence of enriched TGF{beta} and NOTCH signaling transcripts. There appears to be a reduction of transcripts for heterochromatin, nucleosome formation, and chromatin remodeling phenotypes. In addition, despite upregulated oxidative stress gene transcription, we observed a reduction of DNA damage and repair transcripts. GSEA indicated that transcripts for autophagy, extracellular matrix, and inflammation/inflammasomes are enriched. We also observed that the HL-60/S4 macrophage is enriched for apoptosis gene transcripts, which may promote necrotic death by pyroptosis. The long-term goal of this research direction is to see whether this complex multifaceted phenotypic pattern is shared with other types of macrophages and to determine what mechanisms might exist to coordinate these phenotypic facets within a single cell.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

The collection spans seven postnatal time points, mirroring human development from childhood to adulthood, and encompasses five core tissues. We identified 30 cell types, further subdivided into 69 subtypes and cell states across adrenal gland, left cerebral cortex, hippocampus, heart, and gastrocnemius muscle. Our annotations cover both known and novel cell differentiation dynamics ranging from early hippocampal neurogenesis to a new sex-specific adrenal gland population during puberty.

We find recurrent regulatory topics in tissue-resident macrophages, neural cell types, endothelial cells across multiple tissues, and cycling cells of the adrenal gland and heart. Cell-type-specific topics are enriched in transcription factors and microRNA host genes, while chromatin regulators dominate mitosis topics. Corresponding chromatin accessibility data reveal dynamic and sex-specific regulatory elements, with enriched motifs matching transcription factors in regulatory topics.

Equally important, but less frequently used, are inhibitory tools that suppress activity through cellular hyperpolarization. These tools often rely on chloride conductance. Yet, in vivo, re- and hyperpolarization is typically mediated by potassium. In recent years, light-gated ion channels with a high preference for potassium were identified (Kalium channelrhodopsins, KCRs), and their inhibitory potential described in different organisms. Here, we characterized HcKCR1 and WiChR, in cholinergic neurons and muscles of Caenorhabditis elegans. Hyperpolarization of these cell types both induces muscle relaxation and, consequently, an elongation of the animals. Thus, we analyzed body length before, during, and after illumination, to assess KCR effectiveness, and to benchmark stimulation parameters like light intensity and duration. For HcKCR1 in cholinergic neurons, continuous illumination at high light intensities (1-4.5 mW/mm) evoked only a transient elongation, while stimulation at 0.1 mW/mm could maintain inhibition for the duration of the stimulus in some transgenic strains. For animals expressing WiChR in body wall muscle cells or cholinergic neurons, we again observed brief hyperpolarization during continuous illumination, however, still during the stimulus, this changed to body contraction, corresponding to depolarization. This effect was long lasting, and required dozens of seconds for reversion, but could be reduced by pulsed illumination and fully avoided by less efficient channel activation using green or orange light. Hence, KCRs can be applied to hyperpolarize C. elegans cells, but require optimized illumination parameters.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

The process of autophagy involves the engulfment of intracellular targets by autophagosomes and their delivery to the lysosome for digestion and recycling. We have previously reported recessive variants in EPG5, encoding for the ectopic P-granules 5 autophagy protein with a crucial role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, as the cause of Vici syndrome (VS), a severe multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder defined by a combination of distinct clinical features including callosal agenesis, cataracts, cardiomyopathy, immunodeficiency, and hypopigmentation. Here, we present extensive novel genetic, clinical, neuroradiological and pathological features from the largest cohort of EPG5-related disorders reported to date, complemented by experimental findings from patient cells and models of EPG5 defects in Caenorhabditis elegans and Mus musculus. We identified 200 patients with recessive EPG5 variants, 86 of them previously unpublished. The associated phenotypic spectrum ranged from antenatally lethal presentations and the classic VS phenotype (n=60) to much milder neurodevelopmental disorders with less specific manifestations (n=140). Myopathic features and epilepsy with variable progression were frequently observed. Novel manifestations included early-onset parkinsonism and dystonia with cognitive decline during adolescence, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSPP), and myoclonus. Radiological findings included previously recognized EPG5-related features with callosal abnormalities and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and a range of novel features suggesting an emerging continuum with disorders of brain iron accumulation or copper metabolism as well as HSPPs. Genotype-phenotype studies suggested a correlation between predicted residual EPG5 expression and clinical severity, especially regarding disease progression and survival. The Epg5 p.Gln331Arg knock-in mouse, a model of milder EPG5-related disorders, showed an age-related motor phenotype and impaired autophagic clearance in several brain regions mirroring those also affected in humans. In Caenorhabditis elegans, epg-5 knockdown gave rise to neurodevelopmental features and motor impairment comparable to defects in parkinsonism-related genes, abnormal mitochondrial respiration, and impaired mitophagic clearance early in life. Cellular assays revealed impaired PINK1-Parkin dependent mitophagic clearance in patient fibroblasts. Our findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of EPG5-related disorders and indicate a life time continuum of disease that overlaps with other disorders of defective autophagy and intracellular trafficking. Our observations also suggest close links between early-onset neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions of later onset due to EPG5 defects, in particular dystonia and parkinsonism, highlighting the fundamental importance of dysfunctional autophagy in the pathophysiology of common neurodegenerative disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1718575698801

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1718575698801

These computational techniques offer the advantage of analyzing vast amounts of spatial data in a scalable and automated manner, thereby accelerating scientific discovery and enabling more precise medical diagnostics and treatments. In this work, we developed a vision transformer (ViT) framework to map histological signatures to spatial single-cell transcriptomic signatures, named SPiRiT (Spatial Omics Prediction and Reproducibility integrated Transformer). Our framework was enhanced by integrating cross validation with model interpretation during hyper-parameter tuning. SPiRiT predicts single-cell spatial gene expression using the matched histopathological image tiles of human breast cancer and whole mouse pup, evaluated by Xenium (10x Genomics) datasets. Furthermore, ViT model interpretation reveals the high-resolution, high attention area (HAR) that the ViT model uses to predict the gene expression, including marker genes for invasive cancer cells (FASN), stromal cells (POSTN), and lymphocytes (IL7R). In an apple-to-apple comparison with the ST-Net Convolutional Neural Network algorithm, SPiRiT improved predictive accuracy by 40% using human breast cancer Visium (10x Genomics) dataset. Cancer biomarker gene prediction and expression level are highly consistent with the tumor region annotation. In summary, our work highlights the feasibility to infer spatial single-cell gene expression using tissue morphology in multiple-species, i.e., human and mouse, and multi-organs, i.e., mouse whole body morphology. Importantly, incorporating model interpretation and vision transformer is expected to serve as a general-purpose framework for spatial transcriptomics.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

In eukaryotes, N-terminal methionine excision (NME) by Methionine Aminopeptidases (MAP1 and MAP2), and N-terminal acetylation (NTA) by N-Acetyl-Transferase A (NatA), is the most common set of subsequent modifications carried out on the ribosome. How these two enzymatic processes are coordinated in quick succession in the context of a rapidly translating ribosome has remained elusive. Here, we report that human NatA occupies a non-intrusive 'distal' binding site on the ribosome which does not interfere with most other ribosome associated factors (RAFs). In this position, NatA can partake in a coordinated and dynamic assembly with MAP1 through a complex scaffolding function of the abundant Nascent Polypeptide Associated Complex (NAC). Alternatively, MAP2 can co-occupy the PTE with NatA in preparation for successive NME and NTA. In contrast to MAP1, MAP2 completely covers the PTE and is thus incompatible with NAC and MAP1 recruitment. Both assemblies can compile on the human ribosome independent of nascent chain substrates. Together, our structures provide the structural framework for the rapid coordinated orchestration of NME and NTA in protein biogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

However, the molecular mechanisms that dictate SA localization at selected synapses remain elusive. Here, we identify a postsynaptic signaling complex comprising the GPCR-like receptor GPR158 and a largely uncharacterized phospholipase C (PLC), PLCXD2, that controls SA abundance. Sparse genetic manipulations in vivo demonstrate that in the absence of GPR158, unrestrained PLCXD2 activity impedes postsynaptic SA incorporation and hampers dendritic spine maturation. Finally, we show that extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) binding modulates the GPR158-PLCXD2 interaction. Together, our findings reveal how a postsynaptic receptor signaling complex regulates the local lipid microenvironment to control SA abundance required for the proper maturation of dendritic spines.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Prior to 2022, there were only three documented sightings of the sabrewing since it was described in 1879, including only one record between 1946 and 2022. As a result, this ""lost"" species has long been one of the most poorly-known birds in Colombia. We located a resident population of Santa Marta Sabrewing along the Guatapuri River near the Chemesquemena and Guatapuri villages in July 2022, and at its type locality, San Jose, in January 2023. Based on historical data and newly-collected field observations, we assess the species status and describe aspects of its natural history and ecology. Our review indicates the species has been frequently misidentified in the past, and that to date, documented evidence of its presence is limited to five localities, almost all of them restricted to the south-eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, along the mid Guatapuri river basin. Consequently, this bird appears to represent a case of microendemism. Following IUCN criteria, our data suggest that Santa Marta Sabrewing should remain listed as CR. Field observations indicate that the species is highly associated with watercourses, where males hold year-round territories and form leks. We obtained records of males in mid-elevation habitats (1,150-1,850 m) for 16 consecutive months between July 2022 and October 2023, suggesting that the species might not be an elevational migrant, as previously speculated. More information is needed to understand the species ecology so that effective conservation actions can be designed in collaboration with the indigenous communities with which the species coexists.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

The design of specific protein-protein interfaces to create customized protein assemblies holds immense potential for various biotechnological applications. To address the current limitations in designing heteromeric interactions for multi-component assemblies, we developed a hybrid generative AI design approach. This method combines deep learning and automated reasoning, explicitly considering both positive and negative interaction states to favor heteromeric desired over undesired interactions. The approach leverages Effie, a deep-learned pairwise decomposable scoring function, and an advanced reasoning tool extended for multicriteria optimization of this function. Here, we tested the ability of this hybrid AI method to redesign homomeric interfaces of bacterial microcompartment components (BMC-H) into heteromeric assemblies. We benchmarked its performance against ProteinMPNN, a sequence design autoregressive model. Our in silico assessment, complemented by experimental validation, highlights the hybrid AI generative design approach's outperformance and its potential to unlock the engineering of complex multi-component self-assembling protein entities.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

We found a cline in short stamen number from retention of short stamens in high elevation populations to incomplete loss in low elevation populations. We did not find evidence that limited genetic variation constrains the loss of short stamens at high elevations nor evidence for divergent selection on short stamens between high and low elevations. Finally, we identified loci associated with short stamens in the Spanish Pyrenees that are different from loci associated with variation in short stamen number across latitudes from a previous study.

The ACC may achieve this by integrating reward information over time to estimate which objects are worth to explore and which objects should be avoided. Such a higher-order meta-awareness about which objects should be explored predicts that the ACC causally contributes to choices when the reward values of objects are unknown and must be inferred from ongoing exploration. We tested this suggestion in nonhuman primates using a learning task that varied the number of object features that could be relevant, and by controlling the motivational value of choosing objects. During learning the ACC was transiently micro-stimulated when subjects foveated the to-be-chosen stimulus. We found that stimulation selectively impaired learning when feature uncertainty and motivational value of choices were high, which was linked to a deficit in using reward outcomes for feature-specific credit assignment. Application of an adaptive reinforcement learning model confirmed a primary deficit in weighting prediction errors that led to a meta-learning impairment to adaptively increase exploration during learning and to an impaired use of working memory to support learning. These findings provide causal evidence that the reward history traces in ACC are essential for meta-adjusting the exploration-exploitation balance and the strength of working memory of object values during adaptive behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change with time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a unifying theoretical framework, a general interpretation, and a common set of measures to quantify the dFC matrices properties. Moreover, the dFC field has been lacking ad-hoc algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently. This has prevented the field to show its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real time applications. With this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a unifying approach that allows the study brain signals at different spatio-temporal scales, down to voxel level, that is computationally ultrafast. DySCo unifies in a single theoretical framework the most employed dFC matrices, which share a common mathematical structure. Doing so it allows: 1) A new interpretation of dFC that further justifies its use to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of data interactions in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities. 2) The introduction of the the Recurrence Matrix EVD to compute and store the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of all types of dFC matrices in an efficent manner that is orders of magnitude faster than naive algorithms, and without loss of information. 3) To simply define quantities of interest for the dynamic analyses such as: the amount of connectivity (norm of a matrix) the similarity between matrices, their informational complexity. The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm - the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We demonstrate that all the measures proposed are highly sensitive to changes in brain configurations. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we perform the analysis at the voxel-level, a computationally very demanding task which is easily afforded by the RMEVD algorithm.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

The rapid structural changes seen in plasmid genomes present considerable challenges to evolutionary and epidemiological analysis. Typical approaches are either low resolution (replicon typing) or use shared k-mer content to define a genetic distance. However this distance can both overestimate plasmid relatedness by ignoring rearrangements, and underestimate by over-penalising gene gain/loss. Therefore a model is needed which captures the key components of how plasmid genomes evolve structurally - through gene/block gain or loss, and rearrangement. A secondary requirement is to prevent promiscuous transposable elements (TEs) leading to over-clustering of unrelated plasmids. We choose the ""Double Cut and Join Indel"" model, in which plasmids are studied at a coarse level, as a sequence of signed integers (representing genes or aligned blocks), and the distance between two plasmids is the minimum number of rearrangement events or indels needed to transform one into the other. We show how this gives much more meaningful distances between plasmids. We introduce a software workflow pling (https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/pling), which uses the DCJ-Indel model, to calculate distances between plasmids and then cluster them. In our approach, we combine containment distances and DCJ-Indel distances to build a TE-aware plasmid network. We demonstrate superior performance and interpretability to other plasmid clustering tools on the ""Russian Doll"" dataset and a hospital transmission dataset.

Impact statementStudying plasmid transmission is a necessary component of understanding antibiotic resistance spread, but identifying recently related plasmids is difficult and often requires manual curation. Pling simplifies this by leveraging a combination of containment distances and rearrangement distances to cluster plasmids. The outcome are clusters of recently related plasmids with a clear backbone and relatively large core genomes, in contrast to other tools which sometimes overcluster. Additionally the network constructed by pling provides a framework with which to spot evolutionary events, such as potential fusions of plasmids and spread of transposable elements.

We design the first RNA origami tiles which fold co-transcriptionally from a DNA template and self-assemble into higher-order 3D RNA origami nanotubes at constant \SI{37}{\celsius} in GUVs, where they reach several micrometers in length. Unlike pre-formed and encapsulated DNA cytoskeletons, these GUVs produce their own molecular hardware in an out-of-equilibrium process fuelled by nucleotide feeding. To establish genotype-phenotype correlations, we investigate how sequence mutations govern the contour and persistence length of the RNA origami nanotubes with experiments and coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations, realizing a phenotypic transition to closed rings. Finally, we achieve RNA origami cortex formation and GUV deformation without chemical functionalization by introducing RNA aptamers into the tile design.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718575698801

Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments often form during early mitosis, but are destabilized through the phosphorylation of outer kinetochore proteins by centromeric AURORA B kinase (ABK) and centrosomal AURORA A kinase (AAK), thus allowing for re-establishment of attachments until biorientation is achieved. MPS1-mediated phosphorylation of NDC80 has also been shown to directly weaken the kinetochore-microtubule interface in yeast. In human cells, MPS1 has been proposed to transiently accumulate at end-on attached kinetochores and phosphorylate SKA3 to promote microtubule release. Whether MPS1 directly targets NDC80 and/or promotes the activity of AURORA kinases in metazoans remains unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism involving communication between kinetochores and centrosomes, wherein MPS1 acts upstream of AAK to promote error correction. MPS1 on pole-proximal kinetochores phosphorylates the C-lobe of AAK thereby increasing its activation at centrosomes. This proximity-based activation ensures the establishment of a robust AAK activity gradient that locally destabilizes mal-oriented kinetochores near spindle poles. Accordingly, MPS1 depletion from Drosophila cells causes severe chromosome mis-alignment and erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which can be rescued by tethering either MPS1 or constitutively active AAK mutants to centrosomes. Proximity-based activation of AAK by MPS1 also occurs in human cells to promote AAK-mediated phosphorylation of the NDC80 N-terminal tail. These findings uncover an MPS1-AAK cross-talk that is required for efficient error correction, showcasing the ability of kinetochores to modulate centrosome outputs to ensure proper chromosome segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Pre-stimulus brain oscillations are a potential candidate for implementing biases in the brain. In two EEG studies on somatosensory near-threshold detection, we investigated the pre-stimulus neural correlates of an (implicit) previous choice bias and an explicit bias. The explicit bias was introduced by informing participants about stimulus probability on a single-trial level (volatile context) or block-wise (stable context). Behavioural analysis confirmed adjustments in the decision criterion and confidence ratings according to the cued probabilities and previous choice-induced biases. Pre-stimulus beta power with distinct sources in sensory and higher-order cortical areas predicted explicit and implicit biases, respectively, on a single subject level and partially mediated the impact of previous choice and stimulus probability on the detection response. We suggest that pre-stimulus beta oscillations in different brain areas are neural correlates of explicit and implicit biases in somatosensory perception.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698801

Ideally, patient data are handled in a fully pseudonymised or anonymised way. However, this can make it difficult for medical researchers to access and analyze large datasets or to exchange data between hospitals. De-identifying medical free text is particularly difficult due to the diverse documentation styles and the unstructured nature of the data. However, recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), driven by the development of large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the ability to extract information from unstructured text. Methods: We hypothesize that LLMs are highly effective tools for extracting patient-related information, which can subsequently be used to de-identify medical reports. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a benchmark study using eight locally deployable LLMs (Llama-3 8B, Llama-3 70B, Llama-2 7B, Llama-2 70B, Llama-2 7B ""Sauerkraut"", Llama-2 70B ""Sauerkraut"", Mistral 7B, and Phi-3-mini) to extract patient-related information from a dataset of 100 real-world clinical letters. We then remove the identified information using our newly developed LLM-Anonymizer pipeline. Results: Our results demonstrate that the LLM-Anonymizer, when used with Llama-3 70B, achieved a success rate of 98.05% in removing text characters carrying personal identifying information. When evaluating the performance in relation to the number of characters manually identified as containing personal information and identifiable characteristics, our system missed only 1.95% of personal identifying information and erroneously redacted only 0.85% of the characters. Conclusion: We provide our full LLM-based Anonymizer pipeline under an open source license with a user-friendly web interface that operates on local hardware and requires no programming skills. This powerful tool has the potential to significantly facilitate medical research by enabling the secure and efficient de-identification of clinical free text data on premise, thereby addressing key challenges in medical data sharing.","NA","medrxiv",1718575698802

To define the anatomical substrates of evolutionary change in the nervous system, we undertook an electron micrographic reconstruction of the brain of the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus. A comparison with the brain of Caenorhabditis elegans, which diverged at least 100 million years ago, reveals a conserved nematode core connectome and a wide range of specific substrates of evolutionary change. These changes include differences in neuronal cell death, neuronal cell position, axo-dendritic projection patterns and many changes in synaptic connectivity of homologous neurons that display no obvious changes in overall neurite morphology and projection patterns. Differences in connectivity are distributed throughout the nervous system arguing against specific hot spots of evolutionary change and extend to differences in neuro/glia connectivity. We observed examples of apparent circuit drift, where changes in morphology and connectivity of a neuron do not appear to alter its behavioral output. In conclusion, our comprehensive comparison of distantly related nematode species provides novel vistas on patterns of conservation as well as the substrates of evolutionary change in the brain that span multiple organizational levels.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698802

These regions, formed by highly similar tandem arrays, pose significant challenges for experimental and informatic study, impeding sequence-level descriptions essential for understanding genetic variation. Here, we report the assembly and variation analysis of such repetitive regions in Drosophila melanogaster, offering significant improvements to the existing community reference assembly. Our work successfully recovers previously elusive segments, including complete reconstructions of the histone locus and the pericentric heterochromatin of the X chromosome, spanning the Stellate locus to the distal flank of the rDNA cluster. To infer structural changes in these regions where alignments are often not practicable, we introduce landmark anchors based on unique variants that are putatively orthologous. These regions display considerable structural variation between different D. melanogaster strains, exhibiting differences in copy number and organization of homologous repeat units between haplotypes. In the histone cluster, although we observe minimal genetic exchange indicative of crossing over, the variation patterns suggest mechanisms such as unequal sister chromatid exchange. We also examine the prevalence and scale of concerted evolution in the histone and Stellate clusters and discuss the mechanisms underlying these observed patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698802

To develop a versatile system, we evaluated the surface expression and activities of multiple constructs containing distinct extracellular fluorescein-binding domains. Using an optimized receptor, we devised ways to regulate signaling via fluorescein-based chemical transformations, including an approach based on a bio-orthogonal chemical ligation and a spatially controllable strategy via the photo-patterned uncaging of an o-nitrobenzyl-caged fluorescein conjugate. We further demonstrate that fluorescein-conjugated extracellular matrix (ECM)-binding peptides can regulate SynNotch activity depending on the folding state of collagen-based ECM networks. Treatment with these conjugates enabled cells to distinguish between folded versus denatured collagen proteins and enact dose-dependent gene expression responses depending on the nature of the signaling adaptors presented. To demonstrate the utility of these tools, we applied them to control the myogenic conversion of fibroblasts into myocytes with spatial and temporal precision and in response to denatured collagen-I, a biomarker of multiple pathological states. Overall, we introduce an optimized fluorescein-binding SynNotch as a versatile tool for regulating transcriptional responses to extracellular ligands based on the widely used and clinically-approved fluorescein dye.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698802

We identified risk genes expressed in brain organizers and sequential gene regulatory networks across corticogenesis revealing disease-specific critical phases, when NSCs are more vulnerable to gene dysfunctions, and converging signaling across multiple diseases.

(GAA)n repeat expansions are responsible for Friedreich's ataxia as well as late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs). Thus, the mechanisms of (GAA)n repeat expansions attract broad scientific attention. To investigate the role of DNA nicks in this process, we utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase system to introduce targeted nicks adjacent to the (GAA)n repeat tract. We found that DNA nicks 5' of the (GAA)100 run led to a dramatic increase in both the rate and scale of its expansion in dividing cells. Strikingly, they also promoted large-scale expansions of carrier- and large normal-size (GAA)n repeats, recreating, for the first time in a model system, the expansion events that occur in human pedigrees. DNA nicks 3' of the (GAA)100 repeat led to a smaller but significant increase in the expansion rate as well. Our genetic analysis implies that in dividing cells, conversion of nicks into double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication followed by DSB or fork repair leads to repeat expansions. Finally, we showed that 5' strand nicks increase expansion frequency in non-dividing yeast cells, albeit to a lesser extent that in dividing cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698802

However, there are more observable biomechanical compensation strategies within TUG that are indicative of underlying neuromuscular issues and movement priorities. In individuals with unilateral knee osteoarthritis, an increased trunk flexion during TUG is a common phenomenon, often attributed to muscle weakness and/or pain avoidance. Unfortunately, it is difficult to differentiate between these underlying causes using experimental studies alone. This study aimed to distinguish between muscle weakness and pain avoidance as contributing factors, using predictive neuromuscular simulations of the sit-to-walk movement. Muscle weakness was simulated by reducing the maximum isometric force of the vasti muscles (ranging from 20% to 60%), while pain avoidance was integrated as a movement objective, ensuring that peak knee load did not exceed predefined thresholds (2-4 times body weight). The simulations demonstrate that a decrease in muscular capacity led to greater trunk flexion, while pain avoidance led to slower movement speeds and altered muscle recruitments, but not to greater trunk flexion. Our predictive simulations thus indicate that increased trunk flexion is more likely the result of lack of muscular reserve rather than pain avoidance. These findings align with reported differences in kinematics and muscle activations between moderate and severe knee osteoarthritis patients, emphasizing the impact of severe muscle weakness in those with advanced knee osteoarthritis. The simulations offer valuable insights into the mechanisms behind altered movement strategies, potentially guiding more targeted treatment.","10.3389/fbioe.2024.1346365","medrxiv",1718575698802

Using a brain-computer interface (BCI) to classify MC spectral power in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to trigger FES-delivery with detection of movement attempts improved motor outcomes in chronic stroke patients. We hypothesized that heightened neural plasticity earlier post-stroke would further enhance corticomuscular functional connectivity and motor recovery.

The primary outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Upper Extremity (FMA-UE).

The BCI group showed greater: FMA-UE improvement; motor evoked potential amplitude; beta oscillatory power and long-range temporal correlation reduction over contralateral MC; and corticomuscular coherence with contralateral MC.

We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells.

The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic.

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022).

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698802

Given the recent detection of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle and H5N1 RNA detections in pasteurized retail milk in the United States, we established the Pan-Canadian Milk (PCM) Network. Through our network of collaborators from across Canada, retail milk is being procured longitudinally and sent to a central laboratory for testing for the presence of influenza A virus RNA. To date (3 June 2024), we have tested 34 retail milk samples from five Canadian provinces (NL, NS, PEI, NB, QC, MB, and AB) and all have tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. Testing is ongoing and these results will be updated on rolling basis as additional data becomes available. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. Routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale will allow for monitoring of infected dairy cattle on an ongoing basis in a cost-effective, standardized, scalable and easily accessible manner. Our network and testing will act as an early warning system which will enable rapid responses necessary to contain an outbreak should any samples test positive.","NA","medrxiv",1718575698802

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface and to a new and highly relevant livestock species, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698802

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698802

It is therefore critical to track this virus using genomic surveillance. However, the complex patterns of viral genomic diversity make it challenging to use the existing genotype classification system. Here we propose adding two sub-genotypic levels of virus classification, named major and minor lineages. These lineages have high thresholds for phylogenetic distance and clade size, rendering them stable between phylogenetic studies. We present an assignment tool to show that the proposed lineages are useful for regional, national and sub-national discussions of relevant DENV diversity. Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences. We provide a standardized neutral descriptor of DENV diversity with which we can identify and track lineages of potential epidemiological and/or clinical importance.

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1718575698802

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.
