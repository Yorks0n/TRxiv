Sometimes input is surprising, under which circumstances the brain must calibrate erroneous predictions so that perception is veridical. Despite the extensive literature investigating the nature of prediction error signalling, it is still unclear how this process interacts with the functionally segregated nature of the visual cortex, particularly within the temporal domain. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from humans whilst they viewed static image trajectories containing a bound object that sequentially changed along different visual attribute dimensions (shape and colour). Crucially, the context of this change was designed to appear random (and unsurprising) or violate the established trajectory (and cause a surprise). Event-related potential analysis found no effects of surprise after controlling for cortical adaptation. However, multivariate pattern analyses found whole-brain neural representations of visual surprise that overlapped between attributes, albeit at distinct, attribute-specific latencies. These findings suggest that visual surprise results in whole-brain, generalised (i.e., attribute-agnostic) prediction error responses that conform to an attribute-dependent temporal hierarchy.","[{""name"":""Australian Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0314h5y94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335617

However, existing profiling tools are typically tailored to specific use cases, have limited scalability for large datasets, and lack robust methods to aggregate or summarize traits at internal tree nodes. Here, we present TreeProfiler, a tool for automated annotation and interactive exploration of hundreds of features along large gene and species trees, with seamless summarization of mapped traits at internal nodes. TreeProfiler supports the profiling of custom continuous and discrete traits, as well as ancestral character reconstruction and phylogenetic signal tests. It also integrates commonly used genomic features, including multiple sequence alignments, protein domain architectures, and functional annotations. We demonstrate TreeProfilers utility beyond traditional phylogenetic profiling by analyzing functional diversification and domain architectures within the pyruvate flavodoxin/ferredoxin oxidoreductase gene family (13,297 genes), and by profiling the relative abundance of 124,295 bacterial and archaeal species across 51 biomes.

Given differences in organoid-culture format and image acquisition among research groups, there is a general need for versatile segmentation algorithms that refine for specific applications. Here, we introduce OrganoSeg2, an overhauled software that substantively advances the multi-window adaptive thresholding of its predecessor. OrganoSeg2 gives users access to additional segmentation parameters that were latent in OrganoSeg, and common operations are accelerated [~]10-fold. Using data from six organoid types, we find that the generalized segmentation accuracy of OrganoSeg2 surpasses multiple alternatives, including segmenters based on deep learning. OrganoSeg2 adds longitudinal single-organoid tracking and multicolor fluorescence quantification, which we use to examine growth trajectories and radiotherapy responses in luminal breast cancer organoids. OrganoSeg2 is shared freely as installation packages for current users and source code for future developers (https://github.com/JanesLab/OrganoSeg2).

MOTIVATIONOrganoids are routinely documented with low-magnification brightfield and fluorescence images that are challenging to quantify accurately in large numbers. OrganoSeg2 is a streamlined, highly customizable segmenter that surpasses its prior version and AI-themed competitors in various organoid contexts.

Migrants typically minimize flights over barriers in opposing winds, while crossing the same barriers directly in supportive winds. Nevertheless, even in supportive conditions, barrier-crossings likely involve a number of risk-mitigating behaviors, including the use of stepping stones. We aimed to understand how seasonal ocean-crossings of Eleonoras falcons (Falco eleonorae) compare in terms of wind support and flight effort, and whether falcons use islands to cross safely in variable wind conditions. To do this we combined GPS-tracking data from 19 individuals over a decade (2012-2022) with wind data from an atmospheric reanalysis model. Despite major differences in wind support, falcons achieved similar ground speeds in both seasons. That is because falcons reduce instantaneous flight effort by flying at lower airspeeds in supportive spring winds (31.5 {+/-} 6.0 km h-1) than in adverse autumn winds (47.4 {+/-} 9.3 km h-1). Overall, it took falcons twice as many flight hours to complete the spring crossings that were 40% greater in terms of air distance compared to autumn crossings. Islands were more frequently used during spring crossings (57.9% individuals in spring vs 21.1% in autumn), and the probability of a falcon using an island significantly increased with weaker wind support in spring (but not in autumn). While wind support partially offsets the extra distance flown over the ocean in spring, isolated islands offer emergency stop-over opportunities when Eleonoras falcons experience relatively weak wind support during protracted ocean crossings.","[{""name"":""Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Spatial Sciences-Island Sustainability"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101050349;""},{""name"":""Cabildo de Lanzarote"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20145859;155354;170503;181116;196273;207319;""},{""name"":""Gobierno de Canarias"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CNS2022-135873;""},{""name"":""Spanish National Research Agency – Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2023-148806NB-I00;""},{""name"":""European Commission – Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""747729 &#34;EcoEvoClim&#34;;""},{""name"":""European Union – MSCA project RELOAD"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101059418;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335617

Here, we introduce a unified, label-free endoscopic platform that combines Raman spectroscopy (RS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) within a miniaturised, forward-viewing fibre-optic probe. This integration enables simultaneous video-rate OCT imaging and subsecond RS acquisition linking morphological and molecular tissue trajectories in vivo.

A wealth of studies indicate that dopamine activity encodes discrepancy between actual and predicted reward, leading to the reward prediction error (RPE) hypothesis. Specifically, it has been claimed that mesolimbic dopamine activity conforms to temporal-difference reward prediction error (TD RPE), a teaching signal in machine learning algorithms. Recently, there is growing evidence suggesting that dopamine is also involved in learning during aversive situations. However, the fundamental computation of dopamine activity in aversive situations is still unknown. A plausible but untested hypothesis is that dopamine activity in aversive situations also encodes TD RPE. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using mice in virtual reality. Mice were trained to avoid electrical tail shocks by running out of a virtual shock zone. Using probe conditions with speed manipulation or teleportation, we revealed that the dopamine signal in the ventral striatum follows the temporal derivative form of a value function. Delivering a reward at the end of the track enabled us to observe the integration of aversion and reward in a derivative form. Moreover, the value functions unbiasedly estimated from the recorded signal is consistent with the initial hypothetical form, with a realistic reflection of a received shock distribution. Taken together, our results show that mesolimbic dopamine activity can operate as a unified teaching signal in natural situations with positive and negative valences.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335617

In humans, the cytosolic (hMDH1) and mitochondrial (hMDH2) isoforms operate in distinct compartments, suggesting potential differences in regulation. Here, we present a comparative analysis of hMDH1 and hMDH2 under physiologically relevant conditions, integrating enzymatic assays, ligand binding studies, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and molecular modeling. Our findings reveal that hMDH2 activity is inhibited by -ketoglutarate, glutamate, NAD+, ATP, and citrate at concentrations consistent with mitochondrial metabolic states characterized by elevated amino acid catabolism or redox stress. Conversely, hMDH1 exhibits minimal impact by these metabolites, with only modest inhibition observed in the presence of ATP and ADP. SAXS analyses confirm that both isoforms maintain stable dimeric structures upon ligand binding, indicating that regulation is not mediated by global conformational changes. Structural modeling and normal mode analyses identify increased flexibility in hMDH1, particularly within the active site loop, thumb loop, and a partially disordered C-terminal helix. In contrast, hMDH2 displays a more rigid architecture and a more electropositive active site environment, correlating with its heightened sensitivity to anionic metabolites. Fluorescence quenching experiments further support these distinctions, demonstrating stronger binding affinities for nucleotide-based ligands in hMDH2 compared to hMDH1. Collectively, these results suggest that isoform-specific regulation of human MDH arises from differences in local structural dynamics and electrostatics, rather than large-scale structural rearrangements. hMDH2 appears adapted to integrate mitochondrial metabolic signals, modulating malate oxidation in response to cellular conditions, while hMDH1 maintains consistent cytosolic function across diverse metabolic states.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MCB RUI-2322867;CHE REU-2150091;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335617

Metaproteomics researchers can measure taxonomic and functional abundances of microbiomes, shedding light on mechanistic details of microbiome interactions with their environment. However, metaproteomic analysis suffers from limited depth of coverage due to the presence of millions of peptides at lower abundance levels. Recent advances in data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry coupled with Parallel Accumulation-Serial Fragmentation (PASEF) technology offer improved depth of coverage. PASEF technology enables simultaneous accumulation of ions from multiple co-eluting peptides by combining ion mobility separation with dynamic quadrupole isolation, allowing efficient and selective fragmentation in a single scan. This boosts ion sampling efficiency and resolves overlapping signals with high sensitivity. In this study, we assessed proteome coverage, quantitative precision, and accuracy of Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and Data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods coupled with the PASEF method. For this, we used a ground-truth mock community containing 28 species (30 strains) from all three domains of life and bacteriophages with a 400-fold dynamic range of organism abundance. Our results showed that diaPASEF demonstrated superior performance, identifying 168% more peptide precursors, 155% more peptides, and 66% more protein groups compared to ddaPASEF. Quantitative measurements showed improved precision with diaPASEF, with 26 out of 28 organisms exhibiting coefficient of variation values below 20%, compared to 24 organisms with ddaPASEF. Both ddaPASEF and diaPASEF methods accurately quantified the 22 most abundant organisms, while measurements of low-abundance bacteriophages showed significant deviation from expected values. Our findings demonstrate that diaPASEF provides enhanced depth of coverage and quantitative reliability for metaproteomics analysis, particularly beneficial for clinical and environmental microbiome studies where deeper functional characterization is essential. This study provides valuable benchmark data to facilitate the development of advanced bioinformatic methods for quantitative metaproteomics.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM138362;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

Multipass transmembrane proteins have increased propensity to be targeted by the RQC, raising the question of whether problems in transmembrane domain insertion and assembly can also cause RQC-eliciting translational arrests. Here, we investigate RQC-mediated quality control of CFTR, a large transmembrane protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. Reporter assays show that although a sizeable fraction of nascent CFTR expressed in HEK293 cells arrests during translation and activates the RQC, multiple interventions compromising CFTR folding and membrane insertion do not exacerbate this response. CFTR translation abortion was also largely unaffected by regulators of translation kinetics such as codon usage, the ribosome collision sensor GCN1, and the SRP ER targeting complex. We propose that the RQC can be triggered by the inherent difficulties in synthesizing transmembrane segments, resulting from their inappropriate interaction with the protein synthesis machinery.

To maintain genome integrity, cells activate DNA repair pathways that prevent harmful outcomes such as cancer or immune dysfunction. In this study, we uncover a novel role for DNA damage during the terminal differentiation of multiciliated cells (MCCs). MCCs, which line the airways, reproductive tracts, and brain ventricles, produce hundreds of motile cilia, each anchored by a centriole. Therefore, MCCs must generate hundreds of centrioles during differentiation. Normally, centriole duplication is tightly linked to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, raising questions about how MCCs override numerical and temporal restrictions on centriole duplication. We find that differentiating MCCs accumulate extensive double-stranded DNA breaks during centriole amplification, with damage levels correlating with centriole number. DNA damage response (DDR) kinases are essential for supporting centriole biogenesis and ciliogenesis. We also observe that transcriptional activity, required for the expression of centriole and cilia genes, produces RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) that co-localize with DNA damage. This suggests that transcription-coupled DNA damage helps initiate a pseudo-cell cycle program, permitting centriole amplification without triggering full S/G2 phase processes. Our findings indicate that MCCs harness DDR signaling as part of their developmental program, revealing a broader principle in which the canonical cell cycle is adaptively rewired during differentiation.","[{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2478-22;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM133897;R01GM114119;R01CA266199;R35GM140813;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

Of increasing interest is the repeated observation that beyond focal lesions, there are also diffuse, surface-in gradients of pathology in MS, wherein damage is most severe directly adjacent to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting surfaces, such as the subpial and periventricular areas. This observation suggests that toxic factors within MS CSF may be contributing to the emergence and/or evolution of surface-in gradients. Directly separating the CSF from the periventricular parenchyma are ependymal cells - a glial epithelium that are equipped with tufts of motile cilia which are critical for circulating CSF solutes and regulating local fluid flow. While damage to ependymal cilia has the potential to drastically modify CSF homeostasis and thus contribute to the damage of CSF exposed regions, these motile cellular structures have yet to be investigated in the context of MS.

MethodsWe first conducted single cell RNA sequencing of fresh human periventricular brain tissue containing ependymal cells from MS patients and non-MS disease controls. We subsequently collected CSF from MS patients and exposed cultured rodent ependymal cells to this CSF in order to evaluate impact on ependymal ciliary function. To complement our direct evaluation of cilia in the context of MS, we also confirmed whether cilia were altered in a classic animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and also designed a novel transgenic animal model to evaluate the cellular and behavioural effect(s) of adult ependymal ciliary disruption.

ResultsSingle cell RNA sequencing analysis of human ependymal cells in MS demonstrated largescale dysregulation of ciliary genes and in situ stains of MS brain tissue confirmed a loss of ependymal cilia. Exposure of ependymal cells to MS CSF led to transcriptional modification of ciliary gene and protein expression and reduced ciliary beating frequency. Likewise, analysis of ependymal cells in EAE also demonstrated altered cilia gene and protein expression. Conditional knockout in adult mice, of the critical cilia-associated gene Ccdc39 in ependymal cells led to transient ventricular enlargement, increased periventricular microglial density, and alterations in nesting behaviour.

ConclusionThese data suggest that motile cilia in ependymal cells are dysregulated in CNS autoimmunity. More importantly, however, they provide evidence to suggest that ependymal cilia disruption could play an active role in the development of periventricular pathology in MS and can lead to behavioural deficits that may underlie aspects non-motor MS symptomatology.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

While much of the existing research has focused on reward-based learning, the contribution of reward-independent learning processes to this imbalance remains unclear. To address this gap, the present study investigated the interaction between statistical learning (SL), a form of reward-free learning, and cognitive flexibility, a key goal-directed function, in a non-clinical population. By adopting a dimensional approach to obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies, this work aims to overcome the limitations of categorical diagnoses and better capture the continuous, nuanced variability of symptoms, while clarifying how specific neurocognitive processes relate to OC tendencies. A total of 402 participants from the non-clinical population completed an online study involving the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task to assess SL and a Card Sorting Task to measure cognitive flexibility. Our findings revealed a competitive relationship between SL and cognitive flexibility. Critically, this inverse association weakened as OC tendencies increased, suggesting that even at non-clinical levels, OC tendencies may interfere with the typical interplay between automatic and goal-directed processes. Notably, SL performance remained intact, and the observed effects were not attributable to reward sensitivity, as learning occurred without external feedback. These findings emphasize the value of examining non-clinical OC tendencies and highlight the importance of investigating neurocognitive system interactions, rather than isolated functions, in advancing our understanding of OCD.","[{""name"":""French National Grant Agency"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-22-CPJ1-0042-01;ANR-24-CE37-5807;""},{""name"":""National Brain Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NAP2022-I-2/2022;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

Whether and how polyploidy modulates the action of natural selection remains debated, and the particular case of balancing selection has been poorly explored. This study investigates the impact of autopolyploidy on sporophytic self-incompatibility in plants, a striking example of a genetic system evolving under a special form of balancing selection (strong negative frequency-dependent selection). Numerical simulations reveal that under strict codominance, the number of S-alleles maintained in tetraploid populations is expected to double as compared to diploid populations. However, under a model with strict hierarchical dominance among alleles, the number of S-alleles increases only slightly, but gene diversity and observed heterozygosity are substantially lower in tetraploids as compared to diploids, due to enhanced dominance masking effects. Empirical data on Arabidopsis arenosa and A. lyrata confirm the latter predictions, showing similar levels of allelic diversity but dramatically lower observed and expected heterozygosity at the self-incompatibility locus in tetraploids compared to diploids. The study highlights the significant impact of autopolyploidy on patterns of diversity at the self-incompatibility locus, emphasizing the increased dominance effect in tetraploids. The results also allow us to reject a scenario of strong founder effects associated with evolution of the polyploid lineages.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-18-CE02-0020-01;""},{""name"":""French State under the France-2030 programme - Initiative d'Excellence Universite de Lille"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R-CDP-24-002-PIE;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""490698526;""},{""name"":""Czech Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01pv73b02"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22-29078K;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-HOW2DOUBLE-101041354;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

To investigate their importance in endogenous Notch signalling, we deployed multi-colour live-imaging to measure Notch transcription-complex enrichment at a target gene locus in combination with the transcription dynamics. The co-activator Mastermind (Mam) was present in signalling-dependent nuclear foci, during Notch active developmental stages. Tracking these highly-dynamic Mam hubs together with transcription in the same nucleus, revealed that their condensation precedes and correlates with the profile of transcription and becomes stabilized if transcription is inhibited. Manipulations to signalling levels had concordant effects on hub intensities and transcription profiles, altering their probability and amplitude. Together the results argue that signalling induces the formation of transcription hubs whose properties are instrumental in the quantitative gene expression response to Notch activation.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""212207/Z/18/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

Functional redundancy, the capacity of different microbes to perform the same function, is considered a key mechanism underpinning the stability and resilience of the ocean microbiome. Although the extent of functional redundancy remains debated, investigating its manifestation in environmentally similar and interconnected microbial communities may provide critical insights into its role in shaping microbial community dynamics. We hypothesized that examining the long-term synchrony and rhythmicity of temperate microbial communities in such locations could provide insight into the role of functional redundancy. High functional redundancy at the community level would manifest as rhythmic and synchronous metabolic functions across sites, even in the absence of synchrony or rhythmicity at finer organizational levels, such as individual genes or taxa, thereby contributing to community resilience. Conversely, low functional redundancy would imply that synchrony and rhythmicity extend to both the contributing genes and taxa, suggesting a greater vulnerability of the community to environmental variability. To test this framework, we analyzed the long-term synchrony and rhythmicity of two marine-coastal microbiomes in the Mediterranean Sea, separated by approximately 150 km and connected by a dominant southwest current. Monthly collected metagenomes from a seven-year period were examined at the levels of metabolic functions (e.g., KEGG pathways), predicted genes (open reading frames), and taxa. We found functions, genes, and taxa exhibiting high, low, or anti-synchrony, as well as displaying rhythmic or non-rhythmic patterns. Although rhythmic behavior was observed on average across all organizational levels, consistent with the seasonal dynamics expected in temperate Mediterranean waters, average synchrony across microbiomes remained low. Focusing specifically on 45 markers of key biogeochemical functions, we revealed that several functions exhibited high synchrony and rhythmicity, in sharp contrast to the low synchrony and rhythmicity among the most abundant genes and taxa contributing to those functions. This suggests that functional redundancy and complementary dynamics at lower organizational levels, with distinct taxa contributing to key metabolic functions at different times, lead to rhythmic and synchronous dynamics at higher levels through emergent self-organization. Together, our results highlight functional redundancy and emergent self-organized dynamics as key mechanisms supporting the stability and resilience of marine microbiomes under environmental change.","[{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2019-105775RB-I00;PID2022-136281NB-I00;PID2023-146919NB-C22;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GA#101059915 - BIOcean5D;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

C_LIO_LIHere we reported that a mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At3g11320 coding for NST protein causes defects in male gametophyte development including collapsed, nonviable pollen. This mutation also caused impairment in the female gametophyte progression by arresting it at the functional megaspore (FM) stage.

While generally thought to be a vertebrate-specific innovation, homologous placodes are proposed to exist in non-vertebrate chordates as well. In Ciona robusta, a solitary tunicate, the adult mouth (the oral siphon) is derived from one such ""cranial-like"" placode in the larva, which we term the oral siphon placode (OSP). At embryonic and larval stages, the OSP consists of a small rosette of cells that forms from the neuropore at the anteriormost extent of neural tube closure. While the morphogenesis of the OSP and its physical separation from other surface ectoderm structures have been described in detail, how this is regulated at the molecular level is currently unknown. Here we show the involvement of protocadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in the segregation and structural cohesiveness of the OSP. Protocadherin.e (Pcdhe.e) is expressed specifically in the OSP but not in other surface ectoderm cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of Pcdh.e in these cells results in loss of OSP structural integrity and ability to physically separate from other structures derived from the same cell lineage. Overexpression of Pcdh.e throughout the anterior surface ectoderm results in similar loss of a physically separate and distinct OSP territory. Furthermore, we show that Pcdh.e expession in the OSP depends on oral placode-specific transcription factors such as Six1/2 and Pitx. Our results suggest that OSP integrity and morphogenesis require precise regulation of a homotypic cell-cell adhesion molecule, which might reflect a conserved mechanism for placode formation in chordates.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM158421;""},{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD104825;""},{""name"":""Division of Integrative Organismal Systems"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01rvays47"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1940743;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

In this study, we develop a conditional knock-in mouse model expressing a mitochondrially targeted variant of the bacterial toxin DarT (mitoAtDarT), which induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage without affecting the nuclear genome. Ubiquitous expression of mitoAtDarT leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by reduced membrane potential and mitochondrial mass, resulting in early embryonic lethality. Employing high-resolution microCT and molecular markers, we demonstrate that mitoAtDarT-expressing embryos fail to undergo normal gastrulation, exhibiting disrupted mesodermal patterning and a complete absence of allantois formation. Surprisingly, defects in lineage specification were evident even earlier, during preimplantation development. Blastocysts expressing mitoAtDarT exhibited reduced total cell numbers, altered trophectoderm-to-inner cell mass ratios, and a striking increase in cells co-expressing lineage markers, indicating a failure in the first cell fate decision. Our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial integrity is essential not only for energy metabolism but also for the precise coordination of cell fate specification and morphogenesis. This work suggests developmental checkpoints are sensitive to mitochondrial genome damage and establishes mitoAtDarT as a powerful tool for dissecting the contributions of mitochondria to embryonic development.","[{""name"":""Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project Identification No. RTI 4006;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGP0038/2021-102;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

To understand how this robust coordination occurs, we use the loss of robustness mutant development related myb-like1 (drmy1), which exhibits variable sepal initiation and growth, causing failure of the sepals to close the flower bud. Specifically, drmy1 has overgrown outer (abaxial) sepals and undergrown inner (adaxial) sepals, leading to a large discrepancy in the sizes of different sepals within individual flower buds. Using single cell and spatial RNA-seq, we found changes in expression of key genes related to brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in drmy1, particularly in cell types important to young flower bud development such as epidermal cells, boundary cells, and meristematic cells. Confocal imaging of a BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1) ratiometric reporter confirms that BR signaling is upregulated and more variable in young drmy1 sepals. Subsequently, we found that altering BR signaling in drmy1 by crossing with BR mutants or adding brassinolide (a potent brassinosteroid) or brassinazole (a brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor) can partially rescue this elongation defect by differentially altering the relative growth of the inner and outer sepals. Increasing BR signaling rescues by increasing the growth of the inner sepal but not the outer sepal, while decreasing BR signaling rescues by decreasing the growth of the outer sepal but not the inner sepal. These results suggest that brassinosteroids mediate the robust coordination of the growth rates between inner and outer sepals during early development, ensuring proper flower bud closure.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EF-2222434;DGE-2139899;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM134037;S10OD032251;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

In the primate embryo, the amnion rather than the trophectoderm is directly juxtaposed to the epiblast and may play this role. To model the interactions between the amnion and epiblast, we differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to amnion-like cells (AMLCs) and juxtaposed them in a controlled manner with undifferentiated hPSCs, which represent the epiblast. We found that juxtaposition between these cell types is sufficient to initiate a range of cell behaviors associated with gastrulation including organized differentiation to primitive streak and downstream mesendodermal cell fates and directed cell migration out of the primitive streak region. Performing knockout experiments specifically in either the epiblast or amnion compartment revealed intricate crosstalk that is required to properly initiate gastrulation. In particularly, using knockouts of NODAL we show that Nodal signaling in both the amnion and epiblast is required for gastrulation patterning. Finally, we show that inductive ability is a transient property acquired during amnion differentiation, and that cells that differentiate from this inductive state acquire an extraembryonic mesenchyme identity. This study establishes a system to study epiblast-amnion communication and shows that this communication is sufficient to initiate gastrulation in the epiblast.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MCB-2135296;""},{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD112488;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

Many PA enzymes are regulated post-transcriptionally, making traditional transcript-based methods ineffective in determining their abundance, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to study PA homeostasis. Here, we refined a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based method to simultaneously quantify activities of two key PA synthesizing enzymes - arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) - from plant tissues using stable isotope substrates. By optimizing substrate concentrations, we increased assay sensitivity >10-fold in tomato leaf tissue. We further adapted this protocol for Nicotiana benthamiana, a model plant widely used for transient recombinant protein expression. Expression of epitope-tagged ADCs in this system revealed a direct correlation between protein abundance and enzymatic activity, demonstrating that ADC activity can infer its protein abundance in native tissues. Proof-of-principle experiments with the N. benthamiana expression system, confirm substrate specificity of tomato ADC and ODC enzymes and essential catalytic residues of tomato ADCs. Beyond enzymatic activities, our LCMS-based method also permits quantification of 11 PA network metabolite concentrations from the same LCMS sample. Visualizing this data as a heatmap pathway diagram, alongside ADC/ODC activities provides a comprehensive overview of PA metabolism in plant tissues. We also studied tomato CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutants deficient in ADC or ODC, complemented by phenotypic analysis. LC-MS analysis of an adc1/adc2 double mutant - an embryo lethal genotype in Arabidopsis - had no detectable agmatine, the product of ADCs. Additionally, despite a reduction in putrescine, no impact on the downstream PAs, spermidine and spermine, was found. The adc1/adc2 double mutant showed severe developmental abnormalities, including complete flower loss, demonstrating the indispensable role of ADCs in flower development. In summary, our optimized LC-MS approach for simultaneous quantification of ADC/ODC enzyme activity and PA-pathway metabolites, the ability to transiently express and functionally analyze recombinant ADC/ODC proteins in planta, and a collection of tomato CRISPR mutants deficient in these enzymes collectively establish a versatile new experimental toolkit to dissect PA homeostasis and PA-dependent developmental processes in plants.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LA 1338/15-1;LA 1338/ 17-1;TRR356 (project number: 690 491090170, subproject B03);442641014;""},{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32372485;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

In parallel, we made diphtheria toxin-mediated cell type ablation compatible with human cells, thereby enabling in-depth interrogation of the sequence of events during depletion and reappearance of stem cells. Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid. Thus, stem cell-derived retinoic acid actively suppresses the regenerative state in colonocytes, explaining how surviving cells sense stem cell loss.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803608;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

Despite these limitations, phytoplasmas, which are parasitic, insect-transmitted plant pathogens maintain a diverse arsenal of secreted effectors that manipulate both plant and insect hosts to promote infection and transmission. These effectors can suppress immunity and reprogram plant development, including witchs broom and leaf-like flowers, through ubiquitin-independent degradation of key transcription factors. However, how phytoplasmas diversify and maintain these effectors in the absence of frequent genetic exchange remains unclear. To address this, we analysed the effectoromes of 239 phytoplasma genomes and identified a diverse set of secreted proteins, which we designated as Phytoplasma-Associated Molecular Effectors (PhAMEs). We found that PhAMEs targeting evolutionarily conserved and structurally constrained surfaces of host proteins are widespread across phytoplasmas. These effectors adopt compact, efficient folds. They often function as molecular scaffolds with dual interaction surfaces capable of linking host proteins or integrating signalling pathways. Such scaffolding PhAMEs have evolved multiple times independently, providing clear evidence of convergent evolution. Despite severe genomic constrains imposed by genome reduction and limited HGT, gene duplications, interface variations, domain fusions, and repeat expansions have helped the shaping effector fold and diversity. While the overall effector repertoire of phytoplasmas appeared largely unique, some PhAME domains share similarities with proteins from other mollicutes and pathogens. Collectively, our findings shed light on how genome-reduced bacteria innovate molecular functions and offer insights into phytoplasma biology, effector evolution, and host-pathogen dynamics. They also lay the groundwork for protein engineering approaches aimed at discovering or designing novel biomolecules with biotechnological potential.","[{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024415/1;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/J/000PR9797;""},{""name"":""John Innes Centre"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""John Innes Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04kg99k11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gatsby Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

Upon activation, they oligomerize into inflammasome-like resistosomes to initiate immune signaling, yet the dynamics of resistosome assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the virulence effector AVRcap1b from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans suppresses immune activation by directly engaging oligomerization intermediates of the tomato helper NLR SlNRC3. Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized vulnerability in NLR activation and reveal a pathogen strategy that disrupts immune complex assembly. This work advances mechanistic understanding of resistosome formation and uncovers a previously unrecognized facet of pathogen-plant coevolution.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/V002937/1;BB/Y002997/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/Y032187/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

Flowering shoot (inflorescence) architecture varies significantly across plant families and is a key target of genetic engineering efforts in many crops1-4. Asteraceae (sunflower family), comprising 10% of flowering plants, all have capitula, a novel inflorescence that mimics a single flower5,6. Asteraceae capitula are highly diverse but are thought to have evolved once via unknown mechanisms7,8. During capitulum development, shoot stem cells undergo prolonged proliferation to accommodate the formation of intersecting spirals of flowers (florets) along the disk-shaped head9,10. Here we show that capitulum evolution paralleled decreases in CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signaling, a conserved repressor of stem cell proliferation. We trace this to novel amino acid changes in the mature CLV3 peptide which decrease receptor binding and downstream transcriptional outputs. Using genetically tractable Asteraceae models, we show that reversion of CLV3 to a more active form impairs Asteraceae stem cell regulation and capitulum development. Additionally, we trace the evolution of CLV3 and its receptors across the Asterales allowing inferences on capitulum evolution within this lineage. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms driving evolutionary innovation in plant reproduction and suggest new approaches for genetic engineering in crop species.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM119614;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IOS-1546837;IOS-1906389;IOS-2214473;IOS-2214472;DBI-2319905;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_204526;""},{""name"":""Research Council of Finland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""341774;""},{""name"":""Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03vxy9y38"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618

This primary genetic cue is often located on a single locus--referred to as sex chromosomes--and can be limited to females (in a ZZ/ZW system) or males (in an XX/XY system). One trademark of sex chromosomes is a restriction or cessation of recombination surrounding the sex-limited region (to prevent its inheritance in the homogametic sex). This may lead to--through a variety of mechanisms--higher amounts of genetic divergence within this region, i.e. between the X/Z and Y/W chromosomes, especially when compared to their autosomal counterparts. Recent advances in genome sequencing and computation have brought with them the ability to resolve haplotypes within a diploid individual, permitting assembly of previously challenging genomic regions like sex chromosomes. Leveraging these advances, we identified replicable diagnostic characteristics between typical autosomes and sex chromosomes (within a single genome assembly). Under this framework, we can use this information to identify putative sex chromosome linkage groups across divergent vertebrate taxa and simultaneously curate misassembled regions on autosomes. Here, we present this conceptual framework and associated tool for identifying candidate sex chromosome linkage groups from a single, diploid individual dubbed Sex Chromosome Identification by Negating Kmer Densities, or SCINKD.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DEB1657662;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IOS2151318;R35GM142836;R35GM124827;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755641335618
