While previous studies have focused on characterizing PASC and identifying its subphenotypes in children and adolescents following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risks of PASC with Omicron-variant reinfections remain unclear. Using a real-world data approach, this study investigates the risks of PASC following reinfections during the Omicron phase in the pediatric population.

OBJECTIVETo investigate the risks of PASC diagnosis and 24 PASC symptoms and conditions after reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron period in the pediatric population.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 40 childrens hospitals and health institutions in U.S. between January 2022 and October 2023.

EXPOSURESA second SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen tests, or a diagnose of COVID-19, occurring at least 60 days after the initial infection, compared to the initial infection.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPASC was identified using two approaches: (1) the ICD-10- CM diagnosis code U09.9 and (2) a symptom-based definition including 24 physician-identified symptoms and conditions. Absolute risks of incident PASC were reported, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by comparing the second infection episode with the first infection episode groups using a modified Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through exact matching and propensity scoring matching.

RESULTSA total of 465,717 individuals under 21 years old (mean [SD] age 8.17 [6.58] years; 52% male) were included. Compared to the first infection, a second infection was associated with significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis (RR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.59), and with many specific conditions including: myocarditis (RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.46-8.86); changes in taste and smell (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.41-5.67); thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.71-3.04); heart disease (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.28); acute kidney injury (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.61); fluid and electrolyte (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.20); generalized pain (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.48 to 1.95); arrhythmias (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.45-1.74); abnormal liver enzyme (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.96); fatigue and malaise (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.64); musculoskeletal pain (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.54); abdominal pain (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.50); postural orthostatic tachycardia syndromes (POTS)/dysautonomia (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.51); cognitive functions (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50); and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33). The risks were consistent across various organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEChildren and adolescents face significantly higher risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest a cumulative risk of PASC and highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies to reduce reinfections, which includes an increased emphasis on initial or re-vaccination of children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo children and adolescents face an increased risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) following reinfection during the Omicron era?

FindingsDuring the post-acute phase, children and adolescents with reinfection are at statistically significant increased risk of incident PASC outcomes, including an overall PASC diagnosis and 24 most commonly complaints/symptoms/diagnoses associated with PASC. The risks remained consistent across different demographic and clinical subgroups.

MeaningThese findings underscore the significant long-term health risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in children and adolescents. Public health strategies should prioritize reinfection prevention, including enhanced vaccination efforts, to mitigate the burden of PASC in the pediatric population.","NA","medrxiv",1743631735134

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Conventional sequencing-based methods lack sensitivity and specificity and do not provide critical spatial information. To address this, we present high-phylogenetic-resolution spatial mapping platform (HiPR-Map), a state-of-the-art spectral imaging technology that enables precise enumeration and spatial localization of microbial cells at species-level within complex communities. Through these advantages, HiPR-Map provides unique insights for LBP discovery and development. Applying HiPR-Map to an LBP designed to complement immune checkpoint therapy, we profiled over 1.8 million microbial cells engrafted in the murine gut. Our analysis revealed distinctive microbial spatial organization, underscoring the power of imaging-based microbiome profiling to optimize LBP design and characterization.

Most Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains carry filamentous phages called Pf that establish chronic infections and do not require host lysis to spread. However, spontaneous mutations in the Pf repressor gene (pf5r) can allow extreme phage production that slows bacterial growth and increases cell death, violating an apparent detente between bacterium and phage. We observed this paradoxical outcome in an evolution experiment with P. aeruginosa in media simulating nutrients from the cystic fibrosis airway. Bacteria containing pf5r mutant phage grow to a lower density but directly outcompete their ancestor and convert them into pf5r mutants via phage superinfection. Reduced fitness therefore spreads throughout the bacterial population, driven by weaponized Pf. Yet high intracellular phage replication facilitates another evolutionary conflict: cheater miniphages lacking capsid genes invade populations of full length phages within cells. Although bacteria containing both full-length phages and miniphages are most immune to superinfection by limiting the Pf receptor, this hybrid vigor is extremely unstable, as a classic Tragedy of the Commons scenario ensues that results in complete prophage loss. The entire cycle, from phage hyperactivation to miniphage invasion to prophage loss, can occur within 24h, showcasing rapid coevolution between bacteria and their filamentous phages. This study demonstrates that P. aeruginosa, and potentially many other bacterial species that carry filamentous prophages, risk being exploited by these phages in a runaway process that reduces fitness of both host and virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1743631735134

By leveraging both sequence and expression modalities, Exai-1 captures a biologically meaningful latent structure of cfRNA profiles. Pre-trained on over 306 billion tokens from 8,339 samples, Exai-1 enhances signal fidelity, reduces technical noise, and improves disease detection by generating synthetic cfRNA profiles. We show that self-attention and variational inference are particularly important for preservation of biological signals and contextual relationships. Additionally, Exai-1 facilitates cross-biofluid translation and assay compatibility through disentangling biological signals from confounders.

Non-human primates were briefly shown a sample array of colored squares. A short time later, they viewed a test array and were rewarded for identifying which square changed color (the target). Better performance (accuracy and reaction time) varied systematically with the phase of local field potential (LFP) theta at the time of test array onset as well as the target location. This is consistent with theta scanning across the FEF and thus visual space from top to bottom. Theta was coupled, on opposing phases, to both spiking and beta (12 to 20 Hz).

The emergence of the ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS) was followed by the diversification of alternative mycorrhizal types, including the ericoid mycorrhizae (ErM). The evolution of ErM coincides with the emergence of the Ericaceae family of angiosperms and the diversification of leafy liverworts within the order Jungermanniales, as well as their expansion into boreal and high-altitude ecosystem. Despite their evolutionary and ecological relevance, little is known about the molecular and genomic basis of ErM. Here, we sequenced the nuclear genomes of two leafy liverworts from Jungermanniales, and reconstituted ErM under laboratory conditions. We demonstrated the existence of a nutrient-regulated symbiotic state that enables ErM and underlies intracellular colonization of plant tissues. Genome and functional analyses revealed that leafy liverworts retain a conserved suite of functional genes that are required for endosymbiosis in land plants. Comparative transcriptomic analysis under ErM-permissive and restrictive conditions identified gene modules associated with endosymbiosis. Transcriptome sequencing cross-comparisons of ErM and AMS identified a conserved gene module required for the intracellular accommodation of fungal symbionts, marking it as a shared feature across diverse types of land plant symbioses. Our study presents the first genomic resources for leafy liverworts, and provides the first experimental evidence that ErM evolved from AMS. This evolutionary transition involved the co-option of a nutrient-based mechanism for the establishment of ErM, and additionally the co-option of two gene modules essential for signaling and symbiont accommodation during endosymbiosis. Our data offer valuable insights and resources for understanding the molecular basis of ErM and its diversification from AMS in land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of microbial communities inhabiting heritage artifacts from Argentinas Museum of Independence. By integrating advanced microscopy with phenotypic and genomic characterization, we analyzed samples collected from wooden objects, textiles, architectural elements, and exterior walls. Scanning electron microscopy revealed diverse and well-structured biofilms, with intricate three-dimensional arrangements embedded in extracellular polymeric substances. A total of 49 bacterial strains were isolated and identified via VITEK MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, with a predominance of Gram-positive genera such as Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Kocuria. Remarkably, the 19th-century albumen print photograph emerged as the most biodiverse artifact, yielding 21 distinct strains, including Streptomyces, Oceanobacillus, and thermophilic Caldibacillus thermoamylovorans. The protein-rich and halophilic environment of the albumen layer likely facilitated microbial colonization and persistence. Pseudomonas species were exclusively associated with this photographic substrate, further underscoring its niche specificity. Human-associated taxa like Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus equorum were prevalent in high-contact areas, while exterior surfaces displayed distinct microbial signatures, including potential pathogens linked to environmental exposure. These findings reveal a complex and artifact-specific microbial landscape, emphasizing the need for tailored, bio-informed conservation strategies.

An assessment of these sites revealed that many are enriched for single nucleotide variants that promote or eliminate FOS binding in human neurons. Disrupting the function of individual species-biased FOS-bound enhancers diminishes expression of nearby genes and affects the firing dynamics of human neurons.

However, its precise chromosomal composition has remained elusive due to challenges in resolving repetitive regions. Using PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, we assembled the complete nuclear genome of the Dm28c strain into 32 telomere-to-telomere chromosomes. The assembly revealed conserved chromosomal structures and synteny patterns when compared to the independently sequenced Dm25 strain, both of which belong to clade A (TcI). This indicates that the 32-chromosome karyotype is a stable and conserved feature of T. cruzi. Through a comprehensive annotation pipeline, we refined gene content and resolved haplotypes, resulting in an approximately 25% reduction in core gene redundancy. All chromosomes demonstrate a conserved compartmentalized architecture consisting of core, disruptive, and newly characterized subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeres, enriched in RHS, TS, and DGF-1 genes but lacking MASP and mucins, create a distinct third genomic compartment. Telomere analysis showed significant length heterogeneity, which may influence subtelomeric gene regulation. Overall, this work defines the complete chromosomal complement of T. cruzi, establishing a solid framework for comparative genomics and enabling detailed studies into genome organization, antigenic variability, and evolutionary dynamics across strains and clades.

In excitatory neurons, we identified POU3F2 as a key cis-regulated gene with trans effects on synaptic gene expression and neuronal firing. This study identifies cis-acting genomic changes that cause cascading trans gene regulatory effects to contribute to human neural specializations, and provides a general framework for discovering genetic differences underlying human traits.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Many of these damaging modifications (i.e., lesions) persist into S-phase of the cell cycle where they may stall the canonical DNA replication machinery. In humans, these stalling events are circumvented by one of at least three interconnected DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways; translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), Template Switching (TS), and Homology-dependent Recombination (HDR). Currently, the functional interplay between these pathways is unclear, leaving wide gaps in our fundamental understanding of human DDT. To gain insights, we focus on the activation mechanisms of the DDT pathways. PCNA sliding clamps encircling primer/template (P/T) junctions of stalled replication sites are central to the activation of both TLS and TS whereas exchange of RPA for Rad51 filaments on the single strand DNA (ssDNA) sequences of stalled replication sites is central to HDR activation. Utilizing direct, ensemble FRET approaches developed by our lab, we independently monitor and directly compare PCNA occupancy and RPA/Rad51 exchange at P/T junctions under a variety of conditions that mimic in vivo scenarios. Collectively, the results reveal that assembly of stable Rad51 filaments at P/T junctions via RPA/Rad51 exchange causes complete and irreversible unloading of the resident PCNA, both in the presence and absence of an abundant PCNA-binding protein complex. Further investigations decipher the mechanism of RPA/Rad51 exchange-dependent unloading of PCNA. Collectively, these studies provide critical insights into the interplay between human DDT pathways and direction for future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Here, we investigate using agent-based models how a propensity for early exploration in childhood contributes to cultural adaptation and the evolution of long human childhood. Using a complex cultural task, we implemented a two-stage strategy for exploring this space - children explore broadly, more likely to learn new behaviours, while adults exploit behaviours already known, incrementally improving them. We found that populations that followed this two-stage strategy achieved higher payoffs in the long term than populations using the two exploration strategies in a random order. Our models point at a 'just right' length of childhood - neither too long, nor too short - allowing individuals enough time to explore before exploiting what they learned. Social learning increased payoffs when agents could copy individuals of a variety of ages. Payoffs decreased under environmental change, especially for long childhoods, because adults did not have enough time to recover between bouts of change.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively.

It detects neurons using 3D correlation, which improves the signal-to-background ratio and detectability of cells. Finally, it performs 3D segmentation, detecting cells across imaging planes. We validated Suite3D with data from conventional multi-plane microscopes and advanced volumetric microscopes, at various resolutions and in various brain regions. Suite3D successfully detected cells appearing on multiple imaging planes, improving cell detectability and signal quality, avoiding duplications, and running >20x faster than a prior volumetric pipeline.

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses.

In insects and other arthropods, which have only innate immune mechanisms, four main immune-specific modules contribute to defense against microbial invaders: the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, the melanization response, and phagocytosis by plasmatocytes. Our present understanding of their relative importance remains fragmented, as their contribution to host defense has never been simultaneously assessed across a large panel of pathogens. Here, we have taken advantage of newly-described immune mutants in a controlled genetic background to systematically delete these four immune modules individually, in pairs, or all four simultaneously. Surprisingly, flies simultaneously deficient in all four immune modules are viable, homozygous fertile, and display no overt morphological defects, suggesting these immune mechanisms are not strictly required for organismal development. With this new set of lines, we assessed the individual and collective contribution of each module to host defense against five viruses, three fungi, eight Gram-positive bacteria, and eight Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings show that these four modules largely function independently or additively in host defense, although synergistic effects can occur for select pairs of modules. Our study confirmed the importance of the Imd pathway against Gram-negative bacteria and the Toll pathway against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, largely via the induction of effectors such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and Bomanins (Bom), but also reveals an important role of melanization against viruses, and a contribution of phagocytosis against various germs. Additionally, by examining microbial load kinetics in different mutants, we provide insight into how these modules contribute to tolerance or resistance against specific microbes. Our study provides insights into the architecture of the Drosophila immune system, revealing differential requirements of immune modules according to each pathogen. The set of immune deficient lines provided here offers tools to better assess the role of these immune modules in host defense.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

MethodsData were extracted from linked administrative healthcare claims and electronic health records (EHR) for vaccinations from 23 August 2024 through 24 December 2024 and followed through 31 December 2024. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study with propensity score weighting to adjust for differences between groups to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 outcomes. VE was calculated as 1 minus the hazard ratio (HR) from Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsOverall, 465,073 mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine recipients were matched 1:1 to unexposed adults. The mean (standard deviation) age was 63 (17) years, with more than half of the population being 65 years or older. Approximately 70% of individuals had an underlying medical condition making them high risk for severe outcomes for COVID-19. VE was 52.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.8%, 65.8%) against COVID-19-related hospitalization and 39.4% (35.0%, 43.5%) against medically attended COVID-19 over a median follow-up of 57 (interquartile range: 33-78) days.

ConclusionThe mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine demonstrated significant incremental effectiveness in preventing hospitalization with COVID-19 and medically attended COVID-19 in adults during the 2024-2025 season to date. These findings support ongoing vaccination efforts to mitigate the public health impact of COVID-19.

In these pathways, including CBASS and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cGAS-STING in humans, oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response. In a surprising inversion of this process, we show here that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that maintains cell health. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TM{beta}. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TM{beta} oligomerization and consequent cell death due to inner membrane collapse. These findings unveil a powerful new defense strategy against virus-mediated immune suppression, expanding our understanding of oligonucleotides in cell health and disease.

However, the gut microbiome can interact with these parasites to influence infection outcomes, raising the possibility that its response to increasing temperatures may help buffer against increased infection burden. To evaluate this hypothesis, we sought to determine if the microbiome is resistant or resilient to the stressors of increased water temperature, helminth exposure, and their combination, and whether this variation linked to infection outcomes. We leveraged the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model organism to measure how these variables relate to the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome. In particular, we exposed adult zebrafish to the parasitic whipworm Pseudocapillaria tomentosa across three different water temperatures (28oC, 32oC, 35oC), and analyzed fecal microbiome samples at five time points across 42 days. Our findings show that parasite exposure and water temperature independently alter gut microbiome diversity. Moreover, we find that water temperature moderates the association between parasite infection and the gut microbiome. Consistent with this observation, but at odds with current expectations, we find that increasing water temperature reduces parasitic infection in fish. Overall, our results indicate that water temperature alters the contextual landscape of the gut microbiome to impact its response to an exogenous stressor of an intestinal parasite in zebrafish. Furthermore, our findings represent the first report of the effects of elevated temperature on parasitic nematode development in a fish host. Importantly, our study demonstrates that climate change may have unanticipated and environmentally contingent impacts to vertebrate gut microbiomes and health outcomes in response to an exogenous stressor.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Despite advances in collagen extraction protocols, the process remains destructive, requiring sampling by sawing, drilling or crushing of dry bone, that can damage or destroy physical features and archaeological evidence, and often consumes the entire specimen. While non-destructive approaches have recently been applied in ancient genomics and palaeoproteomics, no equivalent approach has been established for radiocarbon dating of bone. Here, we outline a non-destructive collagen extraction workflow that avoids invasive sampling (cutting or drilling) and produces no visible damage to the bone. By heating the bone in hot water for several hours, collagen is solubilized, and the resulting collagenous solution can be purified and AMS dated. Here we show that the amino acid composition, C/N atomic ratios, {delta}13C and {delta}15N values of the hot-water-extracted collagen are comparable to collagen isolated from the same bones using classic decalcification methodologies. The hot water extraction method was tested on various bones, ranging from the Bronze Age to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods, which had been dated previously using routine destructive methods that involved acid demineralization.

Alternative splicing is a molecular mechanism enabling a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms with distinct biological functions3. However, while protein isoforms are ubiquitous in humans, we here show that they are rarely considered when investigating common or rare genetic variants. To address this gap, we systematically assessed the impact of isoform-level analysis across more than 100 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) datasets and 76 million human genetic variants. Using strict colocalization, we find that ~45% of genes associated with human phenotypes via Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) exhibit isoform-specific effects. Similarly, we find that 72% of rare pathogenic variants alter their interpretation depending on the isoform expressed in relevant tissues or cell types. These findings establish isoform-level analysis as an essential approach for genetic research. Furthermore, they underscore the necessity of (re)analyzing genetic data at isoform resolution, thereby unlocking deeper insights into human biology and expanding clinical applications.","NA","medrxiv",1743631735134

Its surface offers a unique ecological niche for microbial colonization and serves as a primary habitat for degrading microorganisms. Despite the pivotal role microbial communities play in plastic degradation, there has been limited research on constructing stable, interacting microbial consortia. In this study, we explored the potential of evolving bacterial biofilm communities to enhance polyethylene degradation. Through long-term experimental evolution, six microbial populations underwent 40 selection cycles using polyethylene as their sole carbon source. The resulting evolved communities formed robust, multi-species biofilms with enhanced degradation capabilities, outperforming their ancestral populations in biofilm production. Pseudomonas stutzeri emerged as the dominant species, orchestrating a synergistic interaction with two other isolates through metabolic division of labor. (Meta)-transcriptomics analysis revealed that Pseudomonas primarily contributed to the expression of enzymes involved in microbe-mediated degradation of polyethylene, whereas the other community members were responsible for secreting extracellular polysaccharides, improving biofilm formation. This study highlights the potential of experimentally evolved microbial consortia to synergistically accelerate plastic biodegradation, offering promising strategies for environmental bioremediation.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

While cortically implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer high communication bandwidth to assist and rehabilitate these patients, their invasiveness and long-term stability limits broader adoption.

MethodsWe developed a minimally invasive BCI with 8 chronic epidural electrodes above primary sensorimotor cortex to restore hand functions of tetraplegia patients. With wireless powering and neural data transmission, this system enables real-time BCI control of hand movements and hand function rehabilitation in home use. A complete spinal cord injury (SCI) patient with paralyzed hand functions was recruited in this study.

ResultsOver a 9-month period of home use, the patient achieved an average grasping detection F1-score of 0.91, and a 100% success rate in object transfer tests, with this minimally invasive BCI and a wearable exoskeleton hand. This system allowed the patient to perform eating, drinking and other daily tasks involving hand functions. Additionally, the patient showed substantial neurological recovery through consecutive BCI training, regaining the ability to hold objects without BCI. The patient exhibited a 5-point improvement in upper limb motor scores and a 27-point increase in the action research arm test (ARAT). A maximal increase of 12.2 V was observed in the peak of somatosensory evoked potential, which points to a considerable recovery in impaired spinal cord connections.

ConclusionsIn a tetraplegia patient with complete spinal cord injury, an epidural minimally invasive BCI assisted the patients hand grasping to perform daily tasks, and 9-month consecutive BCI use significantly improved the hand functions.","NA","medrxiv",1743631735134

However, many patients harbor antibodies and B cells directed against allogeneic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, notably HLA-A2, greatly decreasing their likelihood of receiving a compatible organ. Moreover, antibody-mediated rejection is a significant contributor to chronic transplant rejection. Current strategies to desensitize patients non-specifically target circulating antibodies and B cells, resulting in poor efficacy and complications. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are immune cells dedicated to suppressing specific immune responses by interacting with both innate and adaptive immune cells. Here, we genetically modified human Tregs with a chimeric anti-HLA antibody receptor (CHAR) consisting of an extracellular HLA-A2 protein fused to a CD28-CD3zeta intracellular signaling domain, driving Treg activation upon recognition of anti-HLA-A2 antibodies on the surface of alloreactive B cells. We find that HLA-A2 CHAR Tregs get activated specifically by anti-HLA-A2 antibody-producing cells. Of note, HLA-A2 CHAR activation does not negatively affect Treg stability, as measured by expression of the Treg lineage transcription factors FOXP3 and HELIOS. Interestingly, HLA-A2 CHAR Tregs are not cytotoxic towards anti-HLA-A2 antibody-producing cells, unlike HLA-A2 CHAR modified conventional CD4+ T cells. Importantly, HLA-A2 CHAR Tregs recognize and significantly suppress high affinity IgG antibody production by B cells from HLA-A2 sensitized patients. Altogether, our results provide proof-of-concept of a new strategy to specifically inhibit alloreactive B cells to desensitize transplant recipients.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, known as savings, remain unclear. Recent studies propose that the high dimensionality of neural control enables the retention of learning traces that may facilitate savings. To test this idea we used MotorNet, a framework for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to control biomechanical models of the human upper limb. RNNs were trained to perform reaching movements with a velocity-dependent force field (FF) and without (NF) in the sequence NF1 (baseline), FF1 (adaptation), NF2 (washout), and FF2 (re-adaptation). RNNs showed behavioural signatures of savings in the absence of any explicit contextual input signalling the presence or absence of the FF. Savings was more robust in RNNs with larger numbers of units. We identified a component of RNN activity associated with savings--a shift in preparatory activity that persisted even after washout. Displacing this preparatory activity in the direction of the shift enhanced savings, whereas perturbations in the opposite direction reduced or eliminated savings. These findings suggest a potential neural basis for motor memory retention underlying savings that is reliant on the high dimensionality of neural space, and is independent of cognitive or strategic learning.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Despite recent mechanistic advances, the evolutionary origins of many antiphage immune systems remain elusive, especially for those that encode homologs of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) superfamily, which are essential for chromosome maintenance and DNA repair across domains of life. Here, we elucidate the structural basis and evolutionary emergence of Lamassu, a bacterial immune system family featuring diverse effectors but a core conserved SMC-like sensor. Using cryo-EM, we determined structures of the Vibrio cholerae Lamassu complex in both apo- and dsDNA-bound states, revealing unexpected stoichiometry and topological architectures. We further demonstrate how Lamassu specifically senses dsDNA in vitro and phage replication origins in vivo, thereby triggering the formation of LmuA tetramers that activate the Cap4 nuclease domain. Our findings reveal that Lamassu evolved via exaptation of the bacterial Rad50-Mre11 DNA repair system to form a compact, modular sensor for viral replication, exemplifying how cellular machinery can be co-opted for novel immune functions.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), such as RIG-I and MDA5, sense viral RNA and signal through the adaptor protein MAVS to induce phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF3, thereby driving IFN production. However, activation of RLRs by endogenous RNA ligands can also induce IFNs, leading to autoinflammation. Identifying factors that suppress endogenous RNA ligands is critical for preventing IFN-induced autoimmunity. In this study, we identify a novel regulator, CELF2, that suppresses endogenous RNAs that otherwise activate the RLR pathway. We uncovered a novel role for the splicing factor CELF2 as a suppressor of immunostimulatory endogenous RNA ligands. Depletion of CELF2 in macrophages led to a spontaneous IFN and IFN-stimulated gene signature, dependent on the RIG-I-MAVS pathway. Furthermore, the transfer of RNA from CELF2-depleted macrophages was sufficient to induce type I IFN expression in naive cells. This RNA was found to be double-stranded as RNase III treatment of RNA derived from CELF2-depleted cells ablated IFN induction in naive cells. Immunoprecipitation of double-stranded RNA from CELF2-depleted macrophages revealed several immunostimulatory RNAs, which contribute to the increased interferon-stimulated gene signature observed in CELF2-depleted macrophages. These data indicate that CELF2 suppresses endogenous RNA ligands, which could otherwise activate RIG-I and induce an IFN signature. Overall, these findings reveal that CELF2 is an important regulator of self-RNA ligands to prevent IFN-induced autoinflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

CRISPR-mediated inactivation demonstrated the involvement of EEs in the cis-regulation of host and distal gene expression. Through large-scale cancer genome analyses, we reveal that EE mutations correlate with dysregulated target-gene expression and clinical outcomes, highlighting their potential relevance in disease. Evolutionary comparisons show that EEs exhibit both strong sequence constraint and lineage-specific plasticity, suggesting that they serve ancient regulatory functions while also contributing to species divergence. Our findings redefine the landscape of functional elements by establishing EEs as a component of gene regulation, while revealing how coding regions can simultaneously fulfil both protein-coding and cis-regulatory roles.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

The plant microbiota is generally taxonomically structured. Some of the members can promote plant fitness including growth and stress tolerance. However, microbial imbalance can also result in deleterious effects, a phenomenon known as dysbiosis that was first coined in the gut microbiome field. To unveil the regulatory mechanism to maintain plant homeostatic interaction with microbiota, we performed screening using defined synthetic bacterial communities. We identified an Arabidopsis mutant with altered microbial profiles, an overall increase of microbial load and microbiota-dependent growth defects. Transcriptomic and chemical complementation analyses confirmed that the aforementioned microbiota-dependent phenotypes are contributed by an upregulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway. Upregulation of the jasmonate pathway further promotes microbial growth, possibly forming a positive feedback loop. Even though activation of the jasmonate signaling pathway is known to enhance plant stress tolerance, hyperactivation of the pathway alters plant tolerance or resistance against multiple stressors. Plant association with the microbiota together with proper regulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway are thus essential to maintain plant response to environmental stressors.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

We identified HGT events across these genomes, and identified enrichments for functions previously shown to be prone to HGT. By mapping metagenomic reads from 1,862 ocean samples to these genomes, we also identified co-occurrence patterns and environmental associations. Although we observed an expected negative association between phylogenetic distance and HGT rates, we only detected the association between co-occurrence and phylogenetic distance when restricted to closely related taxa. This observation refines the previously reported trend to closely related taxa, rather than a consistent pattern across all taxonomic levels, at least within marine environments. In addition, we identified a significant association between co-occurrence and HGT, which remains even after controlling for phylogenetic distance and measured environmental variables. Overall, our findings demonstrate the significant influence of ecological associations in shaping marine bacterial evolution through HGT.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

We previously observed that during experimental evolution in the presence of abundant susceptible hosts, the AMR plasmid R1 rapidly evolves variants with increased horizontal transmission due to mutations causing increased plasmid copy number. Yet AMR was progressively lost from the evolving populations. Here, we show that AMR loss was associated with evolution of  stealth plasmids in which the AMR region is spontaneously deleted, making plasmid carriage undetectable by plating on selective antibiotic-containing media. These plasmids transmit both vertically and horizontally more efficiently than the ancestral AMR plasmid, driving AMR extinction in bacterial populations and effectively acting as an intrinsic defence against AMR plasmids.

Accordingly, previous slice physiology experiments in hippocampal area CA1 showed that mGluRIII receptors inhibit glutamate and GABA release only at excitatory and inhibitory synapses formed onto GABAergic interneurons, not onto pyramidal cells. Here, we show that the supposed target cell-specific modulation of GABA release only occurs when the extracellular calcium concentration in the recording solution is higher than its physiological concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. Under more physiological conditions, mGluRIII receptors inhibit GABA release at synapses formed onto both interneurons and pyramidal cells but limit glutamate release only onto interneurons. This previously unrecognized form of mGluRIII-dependent, pre-synaptic modulation of inhibition onto pyramidal cells is accounted for by a reduction in the size of the readily releasable pool, mediated by protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated target proteins, synapsins. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings in behaving mice, we demonstrate that blocking mGluRIII activation in the intact CA1 network results in net effects consistent with decreased inhibition and significantly alters CA1 place cell activity.

Among these, the CRISPR-Cas system has been extensively studied and harnessed as a revolutionary gene editing tool. However, while the biochemical process by which this microbial immune system acquires genetic CRISPR memory and immunity against invaders has been comprehensively examined, fundamental questions about the bacterial physiological state underlying how and when CRISPR memory is formed have only been partially explored. Naive CRISPR adaptation is generally rare, but occurs more frequently when bacteria are challenged with replication-deficient phages. In such scenarios, bacteria are not under immediate threat and have ample time to adapt to the phage DNA, without risking cell death. Accordingly, slow growth caused by low temperatures, low aeration, or bacteriostatic antibiotics promotes CRISPR adaptation, possibly by allowing the Cas complexes more time to adapt before being outpaced. Persister cells are dormant antibiotic-tolerant subpopulations of cells with limited metabolic activity. When a mobile genetic element invades a persister cell, its replication is halted until the host cell resumes growth, providing an ideal opportunity for CRISPR adaptation. Here, we show that transiently dormant Escherichia coli persister cells acquire CRISPR immunity 10-fold more frequently than the general bacterial population. Thus, persister cells, in addition to being notoriously antibiotic tolerant, are primed for CRISPR-Cas adaptation and may be in a state of heightened immune capacity and evolution, securing the survival of the population.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with a latent classifier, we create a latent space that strikes a balance between abstract features related to reconstruction and features pertaining to regional segregation. This approach demonstrates improved cross-species homology and within-species locality compared to existing comparative models.

The flexibility and scalability of this approach offer a promising framework to bridge between more animal models, comparing quantitative imaging modalities, and disease phenotypes.

Here we present mcDETECT, a novel framework that integrates machine learning algorithms and in situ ST (iST) with targeted gene panels to study synapses. mcDETECT identifies individual synapses based on the aggregation of synaptic mRNAs in three-dimensional (3D) space, allowing for the construction of single-synapse spatial transcriptome profiles. By benchmarking the synapse density measured by volume electron microscopy and genetic labeling, we demonstrate that mcDETECT can faithfully and accurately recover the spatial location of single synapses using iST data from multiple platforms, including Xenium, Xenium 5K, MERSCOPE, and CosMx. Based on the subsequent transcriptome profiling, we further stratify total synapses into various subtypes and explore their pathogenic dysregulation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, which provides potential targets for synapse-specific therapies in AD progression.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

To ensure electron transparency, sample thickness must not exceed 500 nm. Focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling has become the standard method to prepare thin samples (lamellae), however, the material removed by the milling process is lost, the imageable area is usually limited to a few square microns, and the surface layers sustain damage from the ion beam. We have examined cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), a preparation technique based on cutting thin sections with a knife, as an alternative to FIB-milling. CEMOVIS sections also sustain damage, including compression, shearing and cracks. However, samples can be sectioned in series, producing many orders of magnitude more imageable area compared to lamellae making CEMOVIS an alternative to FIB-milling with distinct advantages. Using 2-dimensional template matching on images of CEMOVIS sections of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, we reconstructed the 60S ribosomal subunit at near-atomic resolution, demonstrating that, in many regions of the sections, the molecular structure of these subunits is largely intact, comparable to FIB-milled lamellae.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

While spontaneous thoughts have been associated with various neural correlates, the relationship between subjective qualities of ongoing experiences and the brains sensitivity to bodily signals (i.e., interoception) remains largely unexplored. Given the well-established role of interoception in emotion, clarifying this relationship may elucidate how processes relevant to mental health, such as arousal and anxiety, are regulated. We used EEG and ECG to measure the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an index of interoceptive processing, while 51 adult participants (34 male, 20 female) visually fixated on a cross image and let their minds wander freely. At pseudo-random intervals, participants reported their momentary level of arousal. This measure of subjective arousal was highly variable within and between individuals but was statistically unrelated to several markers of physiological arousal, including heart rate, heart rate variability, time on task, and EEG alpha power at posterior electrodes. A cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that the HEP amplitude was increased during low relative to high subjective arousal in a set of frontal electrodes during the 0.328 s - 0.364 s window after heartbeat onset. This HEP effect was more pronounced in individuals who reported high, relative to low, levels of state anxiety. Together, our results offer novel evidence that at varying levels of state anxiety, the brain differentially modulates sensitivity to bodily signals in coordination with the momentary, spontaneous experience of subjective arousal--a mechanism that may operate independently of physiological arousal.

Significance StatementOur findings highlight the relationships between spontaneous fluctuations in subjective arousal, brain-body interactions, and anxiety, offering new insights into how interoception fluctuates with changes in internal states. By showing that interoceptive processing is heightened during lower subjective arousal and that this effect is amplified in individuals with higher state anxiety, our study suggests the brain adaptively downregulates interoceptive sensitivity in response to fluctuating internal states. These results have implications for understanding how spontaneous thoughts shape interoception and emotion, particularly in clinical contexts where dysregulated interoception is linked to anxiety and mood disorders. More broadly, our work underscores the need to distinguish between different forms of arousal, advancing understanding of the taxonomy and ways of measuring arousal.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

However, little effort has been dedicated to determining which specific system(s) within defense islands limit lytic phage reproduction in clinical bacterial strains. Here, we employed the CRISPR-based Cascade-Cas3 system to delete defense islands in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate to identify mechanisms of lytic phage antagonism. Deletion of one island in a cystic fibrosis-derived clinical isolate sensitized the strain to phages from the Pbunavirus family, which are commonly used as therapeutics. The causal defense system is a Type IIS restriction endonuclease-like protein (ENDPaCF1), common in Pseudomonads, however it lacks an associated methyltransferase typical Type IIS R-M systems. ENDPaCF1 protects bacteria against phages with hypermodified DNA and is surprisingly agnostic to the specific structure of the modification, which is unlike typical type IV restriction endonucleases. In ENDPaCF1, the endonuclease domain is fused to a catalytically inactive Endonuclease III (iEndoIII), a domain that recognizes non-canonical bases to repair DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We therefore propose that nucleases containing an iEndoIII domain (END nucleases) can sense diverse DNA hypermodifications. Our findings reveal modularity of the sensing and cleavage domains, as expected of a modification-dependent endonucleases. We further show that some hypermodified phages, including Pbunavirus family members and Wrowclawvirus family (Pa5oct-like) of jumbo phages, encode END nuclease inhibitors that directly bind to the nuclease, likely via the iEndoIII domain. These inhibitors are necessary for Pbunavirus to plaque on clinical isolates and sufficient to enable other hypermodified phages to plaque in the presence of this defense system.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Monocytes are important immune cells responsible for initiating and resolving inflammatory responses to infection. While changes in monocyte populations result in increased susceptibility to infection, there is limited research on the impact of age and sex on human monocyte phenotype and function. The aim of this work was to dissect the impact of increasing age and biological sex on human monocyte phenotype and function. Here we show that older females have increased inflammatory intermediate and non-classical monocytes compared to young. These monocyte subsets were the most inflammatory ex vivo and their frequency correlated with markers of systemic inflammation. Proteomic analysis of sorted monocyte populations demonstrated that the three human monocyte subsets have largely distinct phenotypes. Additionally, proteomic analysis identified key age-associated protein pathways, including complement cascade and phagocytosis, downregulated in monocytes from older compared to younger individuals. We confirmed the proteomics findings showing that circulating C3 concentrations were reduced with age in females but not males. This decrease in complement in older females resulted in reduced monocyte phagocytosis. Crucially, we demonstrate that in peri/menopausal females, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) reversed this expansion in intermediate monocytes and decreased circulating CRP as compared to age matched controls. Importantly peri/menopausal females on HRT had increased C3 serum concentrations and significantly improved monocyte phagocytosis. The data presented here indicate the importance of menopause in ageing monocyte phenotype and function. This data highlights the potential use of HRT in restoring monocyte function in females during ageing.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Epidemiological studies reveal that epilepsy is more prevalent in males, with lesional types being more common, whereas idiopathic generalized epilepsies are more frequently observed in females. These differences stress the importance of considering sex-specific factors in epilepsy diagnosis, treatment, and mechanistic research using preclinical models. To elucidate potential molecular differences that could explain these disparities and inform personalized treatment strategies, we conducted a proteomic analysis of epileptic brain tissues from both an experimental mouse model of genetic epilepsy and humans with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Methods: We employed mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis on brain tissues from DRE patients and the Pten knockout (KO) mouse model of genetic epilepsy with focal cortical dysplasia. Mouse samples included hippocampi from adult wild-type (WT) and Pten KO mice (4-5 per group and sex). Human samples included temporal cortex from 12 DRE adult patients (7 males, 5 females) and 5 non-epileptic (NE) controls (2 males, 3 females). Brain biopsies were collected with patients' informed consent under approved IRB protocols (Indiana University Health Biorepository). Proteomic profiles were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) along with volcano plots to identify significant changes in protein expression. The enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins was conducted by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. Results: PCA revealed distinct clustering of brain proteomes between epilepsy and control cases in both human and mice, with 390 proteins showing significant differences in human and 437 proteins in mouse samples. These proteins are primarily associated with ion channels, synaptic processes, and neuronal energy regulation. In the mouse model, males have more pronounced proteomic changes than females, with enrichment in metabolic pathways and VEGF signaling pathway, indicating a more severe vascular permeability impairment in males. In human DRE cases, 118 proteins were significantly changed by comparing epileptic females to males. Pathway analysis revealed changes in metabolic pathways and the HIF-1 signaling pathway, indicating that altered neuronal activity and inflammation may lead to increased oxygen consumption. Conclusion: These findings highlight significant differences between epilepsy and control brain samples in both humans and mice. Sex-specific analysis revealed distinct pathway enrichments between females and males, with males exhibiting a broader range of alterations, suggesting more extensive proteomic alterations. This study offers valuable insights into potential underlying mechanisms of epilepsy and underscores the importance of considering sex as a key factor in epilepsy research and therapeutic development.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Given this importance, the rational design of microbiomes with targeted functional properties is an important objective. Designing microbial consortia with targeted functions is challenging due to complex community interactions and environmental heterogeneity. Community-function landscapes address this challenge by statistically inferring impacts of species presence or absence on function. Similar to fitness landscapes, community-function landscapes are shaped by both additive effects and interactions (epistasis) among species that influence function. Here, we apply the community-function landscape approach to design synthetic microbial consortia to degrade the toxic environmental contaminant bisphenol-A (BPA). Using synthetic communities of BPA-degrading isolates, we map community-function landscapes across increasing BPA concentrations, where higher BPA means greater toxicity. As toxicity increases, so does epistasis, indicating that collective effects become more important in degradation. Further, we leverage landscapes to rationally design communities with predictable BPA degradation dynamics in vitro. Remarkably, designed synthetic communities are able to remediate BPA in contaminated soils. Our results demonstrate that toxicity can drive epistatic interactions in community-function landscapes and that these landscapes can guide microbial consortia design for bioremediation.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Two factors that likely contribute to this situation include (a) conceptual disagreement about language and its component processes, and (b) intrinsic inter-individual variability in the topography of language areas. Recent functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies of small numbers of intensively scanned individuals have argued that a language-selective brain network emerges from correlations (individualized functional connectomics, iFC) in task-free (e.g., rest) or task-regressed activation timecourses. Here we test this hypothesis at scale and evaluate its practical utility for task-agnostic language localization: we apply iFC separately to each of 1,971 (fMRI) scanning sessions (1,199 unique brains), each consisting of diverse tasks. We find that iFC indeed reveals a left-lateralized frontotemporal network that is more stable within individuals than between them, robust to the granularity of the parcellation, and selective for language. These results support the hypothesis that this network is a key structure in the functional organization of the adult brain and show that it can be recovered retrospectively from arbitrary imaging data, with implications for neuroscience, neurosurgery, and neural engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

In response, plants close stomata to prevent pathogen entry, while the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto) produces coronatine (COR), a jasmonate (JA) mimic, to counteract this plant response. Here, we demonstrate that by COR, Pto exploits CYP707A1 activation in Arabidopsis thaliana, encoding an enzyme that degrades abscisic acid, essential for stomatal closure. Notably, COR-induction of CYP707A1 is absent in other Brassicaceae species, such as Capsella rubella and Eutrema salsugineum, rendering them resistant to Pto invasion. In contrast, in A. thaliana, CYP707A1 enables rapid stomatal opening at dawn in a JA-dependent manner, enhancing gas exchange and chlorophyll content, unlike C. rubella and E. salsugineum. Promoter-swap experiments confirm that the regulatory region of CYP707A1 underlies these evolutionary diversifications.

Widespread neural activity throughout the brain encoded nutrient delivery, unfolding on multiple timescales across many specific peripheral and central regions. Evoked activity depended on delivery location and occurred with amino acids and D-glucose, but not L-glucose. Many gut-sensitive neurons also responded to swimming and visual stimuli, with brainstem areas primarily integrating gut and motor signals and midbrain regions integrating gut and visual signals. This platform links body-brain communication studies to brain-wide neural computation in awake, behaving vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735134

Multiple studies have further suggested a key role for herpesviruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). Using transgenic 3xTg-AD mice, we demonstrate that systemic infection with the {beta}-herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) accelerates the development of cognitive decline, tauopathy, and synaptic loss in the hippocampus, all of which are key features of AD. Accelerated disease progression after infection was associated with substantial lymphocyte infiltration into the brain dominated by CD8+ T cells specific for MCMV. Moreover, T cell receptor analyses revealed that these responses were clonally diverse, suggesting that multiple viral antigens were targeted in the brain during chronic infection with MCMV. T cell depletion during virus chronicity rescued infection-induced cognitive decline. In addition, antiviral drug treatment reduced lymphocytic infiltrates in the brain and reversed cognitive decline, suggesting potential clinical utility. These data provide a mechanistic link between chronic viral infections and the development of AD.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

Human herd immunity limits viral spread but also drives the emergence of antigenic variants that escape dominant antibody responses. We used store-bought milk to profile the collective H5N1 antibody response of dairy cattle herds. We detected HA binding antibodies in specific samples from states with recent/ongoing outbreaks. These antibodies present in milk neutralized replicating virus expressing dairy cattle HA and neuraminidase (NA). Despite originating from independent vendors, dairies/plants, geographic regions, and time, antibodies present in these samples are remarkably similar in activity and HA binding specificity.

Recent studies have revealed that stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are heterogeneous in origin, gene expression, and function. Antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs), are defined by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II expression and can activate effector CD4+ T cells that have the potential to contribute to the anti-cancer immune response, but also can induce regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. Whether apCAFs promote or restrain the antitumor response remains uncertain. Using tumor clones of the KPC murine PDAC model differing in sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), we found that immunosensitive (sKPC) tumors were characterized by higher immune cell and apCAF infiltration than resistant (rKPC) tumors. IMC analysis showed proximity of apCAFs and CD4+ T cells in both sKPC and rKPC tumors implicating interaction within the TME. apCAF-depleted sKPC tumor-bearing mice had diminished sensitivity to ICB. apCAFs from both sKPC and rKPC tumors activated tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells and induced Treg differentiation. However, transcriptomic analysis showed that Tregs induced by apCAFs were overexpressed for immunosuppressive genes in rKPCs relative to sKPCs, and that this is associated with differential chemokine signaling from apCAFs depending on tumor origin. Together these data implicate apCAFs as important mediators of the antitumor immune response, modulation of which could facilitate the development of more effective anti-tumor immune based approaches for PDAC patients.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

Automated image processing, employing unsupervised 3D multiscale Frangi filters, provides orientation distribution functions and local orientation dispersion maps. This enables precise characterization of the directionality of white matter bundles, linking mesoscopic structural properties to orientation details computed at the native micrometric resolution of the LSFM apparatus.

The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a key neuromodulatory center, is crucial for encoding motivational salience and regulating arousal and sleep-wake states through its diverse neuronal populations, including dopaminergic neurons (DRNDA). While the roles of DRNDA neurons have been studied, their specific contributions to threat evaluation are less understood. Recent research identifies a distinct subset of DRNDA neurons that express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and project to the central amygdala (CeA) and the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST). Together, these two regions comprise the central extended amygdala, a key network regulating adaptive responses to threats. We hypothesized that distinct DRNDA subpopulations exert diverging effects on sleep-wake regulation and that DRNVIP neurons play a pivotal role in coordinating activity between the CeA and ovBNST, thereby influencing risk assessment and defensive response. To test this hypothesis, we used a combination of in situ hybridization, immunochemistry, whole-brain mapping, electrophysiology, and cell-specific genetic tools in mice and non-human primates. Our findings reveal that DRNVIP neurons form a key DRNDA neuronal subset, uniquely positioned to regulate the central extended amygdala through a feedback loop. These neurons receive inputs from Protein Kinase C delta (PKC-{delta}) neurons in the ovBNST and CeA and send glutamate-releasing projections back to these regions, modulating PKC-{delta} neuron excitability. Selective ablation of DRNVIP neurons increases activity in both the BNST and CeA, disrupting active-phase sleep architecture and impairing risk assessment and defensive behaviors. Together, these findings suggest DRNVIP neurons control specific phases of sleep and orchestrate the central extended amygdalas role in risk assessment and defensive responses.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics.

In mice, however, OSM signaling causes itch behaviors through a direct effect on its cognate receptor expressed uniquely by pruriceptive sensory neurons. We hypothesized that an expansion in function of OSM-OSM receptor (OSMR) in sensory disorders in humans could be explained by species differences in receptor expression and signaling. Our in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical findings demonstrate broad expression of OSMR in DRG nociceptors and afferent fibers innervating the superficial and deep skin of humans. In patch-clamp electrophysiology, OSM directly activates human sensory neurons engaging MAPK signaling to promote action potential firing. Using CRISPR editing we show that OSM activation of MAPK signaling is dependent on OSMR and not LIFR in hDRG. Bulk, single-nuclei, and single-cell RNA-seq of OSM-treated hDRG cultures reveal expansive similarities in the transcriptomic signature observed in pain DRGs from neuropathic patients, indicating that OSM alone can orchestrate transcriptomic signatures associated with pain. We conclude that OSM-OSMR signaling via MAPKs is a critical signaling factor for DRG plasticity that may underlie neuropathic pain in patients.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

A common theme is generating a nucleotide-derived second messenger in response to phage that activates an effector protein to halt virion production. Phages respond with counter-defenses that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we discover a novel antiphage system we call Panoptes that detects phage infection by surveying the cytosol for phage proteins that antagonize the nucleotide-derived second messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE. OptS is predicted to synthesize a second messenger using a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in Type III CRISPR systems (Cas10) that is distantly related to GGDEF and Thg1 tRNA repair polymerase domains. OptE is predicted to be a transmembrane effector protein that binds cyclic nucleotides. optSE potently restricted phage replication but mutant phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defense. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide sponge that antagonizes second messenger signaling. Using genetic and biochemical assays, we found that Acb2 bound the OptS-synthesized nucleotide, 2',3'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( 2',3'-c-di-AMP ); however, 2',3'-c-di-AMP was synthesized constitutively by OptS and inhibited OptE. Nucleotide depletion by Acb2 released OptE toxicity thereby initiating abortive infection to halt phage replication. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that hosts use to guard their second messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

Understanding the functions of vocal mimicry can help to uncover the evolutionary drivers of vocal learning. Different adaptive functions like interspecific and intraspecific communication have been suggested, as well as the possibility of vocal mimicry to be a mistake during vocal learning. In the present study, we review the occurrence of mimicry in the family of corvids and investigate the socio-ecological factors driving the evolution of vocal mimicry in this group of birds. We recorded evidence of vocal mimicry from primary (xeno-canto recordings) as well as secondary sources (published literature) and found evidence for vocal mimicry in 31 out of 128 corvid species (24%). Smaller species were described as mimics more compared to larger species. Other socio-ecological factors like breeding status, habitat and trophic niche did not have a significant effect. More mimicry was recorded during the non-breeding season compared to the breeding season. We used Bayesian modelling based on existing data from primary and secondary sources to estimate the occurrence of mimicry, suggesting that vocal mimicry may be more widespread among corvids than currently documented, with many species potentially being  hidden mimics. Our study for the first time systematically reviews the occurrence of vocal mimicry across the family of corvids and investigates a range of socio-ecological factors driving the behaviour. Our analysis suggests many corvid species likely to be  hidden mimics and we provide specific suggestions for species which according to our statistical model are most likely mimicking corvid species, hopefully inspiring future field work on those species.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

Heterochromatin erosion is a hallmark of human ageing and H3K9me3 is lost globally in aged mammalian cells. However, the functional consequences of the loss of heterochromatin maintenance have been challenging to model. In this study, we used CRISPRi-mediated deletion of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase SETDB1 in human neural progenitor cells to model disruption of heterochromatin maintenance. Deletion of SETDB1 had a limited effect on cell viability, despite a global loss of H3K9me3 peaks resulting in genome-wide reorganization of heterochromatin domains, cells remained proliferative and expressed appropriate marker genes. We found that a key event following the loss of H3K9me3 maintenance was the expression of evolutionarily young L1 retrotransposons. Derepression of L1s was associated with a loss of CpG DNA methylation at their promoters, suggesting that deposition of H3K9me3 at the L1 promoter is required to maintain DNA methylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that loss of H3K9me3 in human neural somatic cells transcriptionally activates evolutionary young L1 retrotransposons, further implicating these elements in human ageing processes.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

Yet how enhancers determine transcription of their target genes, and how this depends on their relative position inside a cis-regulatory landscape remains unclear. Here we use live-cell imaging to track the activity of a promoter under the control of the same enhancer, but inserted at different positions across a simplified regulatory landscape with minimal complexity. Combined with mathematical modeling, this reveals that RNA production from the promoter occurs in clusters of transcriptional bursts, with enhancer position controlling the frequency at which such clusters appear. This results in bursts being more frequent and occurring more uniformly across cells when the enhancer is genomically close to the promoter than when it is located at large genomic distance. Mathematical modeling further indicates that the enhancer modulates the promoters ability to transition from its basal transcriptional state to a regime where clusters of bursts become more frequent. Our results challenge existing models of mammalian promoter operation, and reveal that enhancer position within a cis-regulatory landscape critically controls the timing and variability of transcriptional output in single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

Building on a computational model of reading, we used 7T fMRI and MEG to reveal a cortical hierarchy in which early visual areas (V1-V4) predominantly encode retinotopic information, whereas higher-level regions, including the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), transition to an ordinal letter-position code. MEG analyses confirm that retinotopic encoding emerges early (60-200 ms), followed by a shift toward ordinal representations in later time windows (220-450 ms). Despite this transition, word position remained a dominant factor across all time points, suggesting a concurrent coding of both retinotopic and abstract positional information. These findings uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the human brain transforms visual input into structured linguistic representations, shedding light on the cortical stages of reading and their developmental and clinical implications.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

Cell migration is driven by the extension of actin-based lamellipodia protrusions, powered by actin polymerization, which is tightly regulated by signaling pathways, including Rho GTPases and Ca2+ signaling. While the importance of Ca2+ signaling in lamellipodia protrusions has been established, the molecular mechanisms linking Ca2+ to lamellipodia assembly are unknown. Here, we identify a novel Ca2+ signaling axis involving the mechano-gated channel TRPV4, which regulates lamellipodia protrusions in various cell types. Using Ca2+ and FRET imaging, we demonstrate that TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx upregulates RhoA activity within lamellipodia, which then facilitates formin-mediated actin assembly. Mechanistically, we identify CaMKII and TEM4 as key mediators relaying the TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ signal to RhoA. These data define a molecular pathway by which Ca2+ influx regulates small GTPase activity within a specific cellular domain - lamellipodia - and demonstrate the critical role in organizing the actin machinery and promoting cell migration in diverse biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

However, the role of these proteins in archaea is currently unknown. Here, we describe a new class of archaeal OLD family ATPases and show that they are not involved in antiviral defense but play an essential role in cell cycle progression. We show that an OLD family enzyme of Saccharolobus islandicus REY15A (SisOLD) is essential for cell viability and exhibits cyclic expression patterns at both transcriptional and translational levels, displaying the peak expression during the genome synthesis (S) cell cycle phase. SisOLD overexpression or knockdown leads to significant growth retardation, cell size enlargement, and increased cellular DNA content. We demonstrate that the ATPase activity but not the nickase activity of SisOLD is crucial for the normal cell cycle progression. Notably, SisOLD copurifies with chromatin-associated proteins, such as Cren7 and a histone deacetylase homolog, suggesting involvement in chromosome remodeling following its replication. Collectively our results suggest that SisOLD plays an important role in chromatin processing and remodeling, revealing a novel function of OLD family proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

The etiology of PMDD, or more generally premenstrual syndrome (PMS) including subclinical forms, is not well understood and both biological and psychological models have been postulated. In the current manuscript we explore the role of emotion regulation ability for the emergence of premenstrual symptoms. Specifically, we were interested whether difficulties in emotion regulation in women with PMS/PMDD persisted as a trait across all cycle phases or were specific to the symptomatic premenstrual phase. We also explored for the first time, whether difficulties in emotion regulation already emerged during the high progesterone mid-luteal phase. 105 women aged 18 to 35 years completed a trait questionnaire on difficulties in emotion regulation, as well as two state measures of emotion regulation during three cycle phases (mid-follicular, mid-luteal, premenstrual). PMS/PMDD was prospectively confirmed across two menstrual cycles in 54 women, while the remaining 51 were assigned to the control group. Our results confirm previous findings that women with PMS/PMDD subjectively report more difficulties in emotion regulation on a trait scale. However, these difficulties were not confirmed in any of the state measures employed in the current study. Furthermore, difficulties in emotion regulation did not account for premenstrual symptom severity in a mediation analysis. This raises the question, whether difficulties in emotion regulation underly premenstrual symptoms or the perception of impaired emotion regulation arises as a consequence of untreated PMS/PMDD. Noteworthy, we were also able to demonstrate via Bayesian analyses, that mood worsening in the premenstrual phase is not a universal occurrence and absent in healthy controls. Taken together these findings highlight the importance of adequate diagnosis and treatment of PMDD.","NA","medrxiv",1743631735135

MethodsRetrospective spatial analysis. Distances between each inpatient facility and the nearest wildfire perimeter were computed on an annual basis using data from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information and CAL-FIREs Fire and Resource Assessment Program. Temporal changes were analyzed via Kruskal-Wallis and linear models.

ResultsThe distance from inpatient healthcare facilities in California to nearby wildfires is decreasing by an average of 628 feet per year, while close approaches are increasing; during 2017-2023, there was 53% increase in the number of inpatient beds within five miles of a wildfire as compared with 2001-2008.

ConclusionWildfires are occurring closer to inpatient healthcare facilities in California. An increasing proportion of Californias inpatient bed capacity is exposed to nearby wildfires. Policies to reduce risk posed by wildfires, prepare for evacuations, preserve access to healthcare, and ensure safe location of new facilities are urgently needed to ensure the safety of patients and the wellbeing of populations that depend on inpatient healthcare services.","NA","medrxiv",1743631735135

The estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) which plays a critical role in mediating estrogen signaling and regulates various physiological and psychological processes. In this study, we investigated the relationship between six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in intron 4 of the ESR1 gene and premenstrual symptom severity, emphasizing symptom- genotype associations and SNP interactions. Results demonstrated that specific SNPs were linked to distinct symptom profiles, such as anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances. Interactions between SNPs revealed both risk-enhancing and protective effects. These findings suggest that premenstrual symptoms may stem from a genotype-linked reduced sensitivity to ovarian hormones, providing a foundation for future research.","NA","medrxiv",1743631735135

The gastrointestinal tract has emerged as an important site of infection and has been implicated as a reservoir for long-term infection, particularly for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. However, whether vaccine-induced systemic antibodies can prevent intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Compared to Vero cells commonly used to assess SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, the intestinal epithelium has a functional interferon response and expresses higher levels of ACE2, enzymes, and antibody-binding Fc receptors that may impact SARS-CoV-2 immune elimination.

MethodsWe evaluated the potential of antibodies from both naturally infected and vaccinated human subjects to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of the intestinal epithelium. Serum samples were collected from human volunteers who had undergone natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 (n=5) or who had received the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (n=13). Banked sera collected in 2016 served as negative controls (n=2). SARS-CoV-2 (WA01, Delta or Omicron) was pre-treated with sera and then used to infect iPSC-derived human intestinal organoids (HIO) or Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was quantified by plaque assay, PCR, or immunofluorescence (IF) after 48-96 h.

ResultsBoth HIOs and Caco-2 cells supported robust infection with SARS-CoV-2. In HIOs, pretreatment of SARS-CoV-2 with a high titer post-vaccine serum completely blocked replication of WA01. Similarly, sera from both naturally infected donors collected in 2020 and sera from individuals who had received a BNT162b2 vaccine significantly inhibited replication of the WA01 strain in Caco-2 cells. In contrast, none of the sera significantly inhibited infection with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. For Omicron, only sera from individuals who had received an Omicron-based vaccine significantly inhibited infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the plaque assay. Across all virus types, sera from individuals who had received Omicron-based BNT162b2 boosters were the most effective at reducing infection in Caco-2 cells.

ConclusionOur results suggest that vaccine-induced antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective in the gut. Our study also supports previous reports indicating that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines need to be adapted to circulating virus strains to convey full protection from infection.","NA","medrxiv",1743631735135

One important source of information is temporal regularities, which enable us to form predictions about when events will occur, and through this, prepare for them in advance. Such preparation was shown to facilitate motor planning, yet the impact of temporal anticipation on perceptual acuity is unknown, and the cognitive computations underlying this process remain debated. To answer these questions, we administered a new difficult change discrimination task with variable anticipatory periods (N=142). We show that both perceptual sensitivity and motor responses are influenced by temporal structure. Using computational modelling, we show that the cognitive operation underlying this behavior is based on a logarithmic transformation of the event hazard rate (HR) and reveal a crucial role of temporal-estimation noise in shaping this computation, both when temporal information is encoded, and when it is decoded. Together, our results highlight the fundamental contribution of anticipation in directing behavior and advance our understanding of temporal processing in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1743631735135

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743631735135
