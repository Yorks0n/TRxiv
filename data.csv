Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

This coordinate system is abstract - with the same grid cells encoding position across different sensory environments; and hierarchical - with grid modules of increasing spatial scale occupying increasingly ventral locations in the EC. Recent theories suggest that a similar abstract coordinate system could offer the same benefits to general memories that are not sequences drawn from a 2D surface. Here we show that an abstract hierarchical coordinate system supports arbitrary sequences in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL). In single-unit recordings from MTL, we find abstract, coordinate-like coding of a simple sequential memory task. In an fMRI experiment with more complex hierarchical sequences, we discover an abstract hierarchical representation in EC: the coordinate representations at distinct levels in the hierarchy are arranged on an anatomical gradient along the EC's anterior-posterior axis, homologous to the ventro-dorsal axis in rodents. These results therefore mirror the anatomical gradient of grid cells in the rodent EC but now for arbitrary non-spatial sequences. Together they suggest that memories are scaffolded on a hierarchical coordinate system using common neuronal coding principles, aligned to preserved anatomy, across domains and species.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

During male meiosis, mammals produce an exceptionally abundant class of piRNAs called pachytene piRNAs. Pachytene piRNAs are required for spermatogenesis and have been proposed to control gene expression by various mechanisms. Here, we show that pachytene piRNAs regulate targets predominantly, if not exclusively, by endonucleolytic cleavage. Remarkably, pachytene piRNAs slice hundreds of RNAs, yet a change in steady-state level is detectable for a small fraction of transcripts. Our data suggest that cleavage of the few targets whose abundance is reduced significantly by piRNAs is essential for male fertility. Other pachytene piRNA targets are enriched for highly transcribed genes, which may explain why piRNA cleavage is often inconsequential for the steady-state abundance of targets. We propose that the retention of pachytene piRNAs throughout mammalian evolution is driven by the selective advantage conferred by a tiny minority of piRNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Their DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) contains a B3 domain that allows base-specific interactions with Auxin Response Elements (AuxREs) in DNA target sites. Land plants encode three phylogenetically distinct ARF classes: the closely related A- and B-classes have overlapping DNA binding properties, contrasting with the different DNA-binding properties of the divergent C-class ARFs. ARF DNA-binding divergence likely occurred early in the evolution of the gene family, but the molecular determinants underlying it remain unclear. Here, we show that the B3 DNA-binding residues are deeply conserved in ARFs, and variability within these is only present in tracheophytes, correlating with greatly expanded ARF families. Using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, we confirm the essential role of conserved DNA-contacting residues for ARF function. We further show that ARF B3-AuxRE interfaces are not mutation-tolerant, suggesting low evolvability that has led to the ultra-conservation of the B3-DNA interface between ARF classes. Our data support the almost complete interchangeability between A/B-class ARF B3 by performing interspecies domain swaps, even between lineages that diverged over half a billion years ago.

Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered during flight like a flag in the wind. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

The genomic revolution has enabled a rapid expansion of our knowledge of genomes in many living organisms, and most of that knowledge is classified and readily available in the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomesizeR tool leverages the wealth of taxonomic and genomic information present in NCBI databases to infer the genome size of Archeae, Bacteria, or Eukaryote organisms identified at any taxonomic level. This R package uses statistical modelling on data from the most up-to-date NCBI databases and provides three statistical methods for genome size prediction of a given taxon, or group of taxa. A straightforward  weighted mean method identifies the closest taxa with available genome size information in the taxonomic tree, and averages their genome sizes using weights based on taxonomic distance. A frequentist random effect model uses nested genus and family information to output genome size estimates. Finally a third option provides predictions from a distributional Bayesian multilevel model which uses taxonomic information from genus all the way to superkingdom, therefore providing estimates and uncertainty bounds even for under-represented taxa.

All three methods use:

O_LIA list of queries; a query being a taxon or a list of several taxa. The package was designed to make it easy to use with data coming from environmental DNA experiments, but works with any table of taxa.
C_LIO_LIA reference database containing all the known genome sizes, built from the NCBI databases, with associated taxa, provided in an archive to download.
C_LIO_LIA taxonomic tree structure as built by the NCBI, provided in the same archive.

This bursting activity can vary across individual cells, and analyzing the differences in transcription sites can help identify key drivers of gene expression for a specific target. Scaffolding methods based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have been widely used to amplify the fluorescent signal of mRNAs and sort cells based on mRNA expression levels. However, these methods are inefficient at targeting nuclear RNA, including transcription sites, due to the probes' limited accessibility through cellular compartment membranes and crosslinked proteins. Additionally, the required formaldehyde fixation interferes with downstream analysis of chromatin and protein-binding interactions. To address these challenges, a platform that integrates amplified FISH with reversible crosslinkers and allows access to the nucleus is needed. In response, we developed nuclear clampFISH (nuclampFISH). This method amplifies the fluorescent signal of mRNAs using a reversible crosslinker, enabling the sorting of cells based on nuclear RNA expression and compatible with downstream biochemical analysis. This assay demonstrates that transcriptionally active cells have more accessible chromatin for a respective gene. Notably, the tools developed are highly accessible and do not require specialized computation or equipment.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

To enhance the depth, accuracy, and throughput of SCP for tumor analysis, we developed an automated, high-throughput pipeline that enables the analysis of 1,536 single cells in a single experiment. This approach integrates low-volume sample preparation, automated sample purification, and LC-MS analysis with the Slice-PASEF method. Integration of these methodologies into a streamlined pipeline led to a robust and reproducible identification of more than 3000 proteins per cell. We applied this pipeline to analyze tumor macrophages in a murine lung metastasis model. We identified over 1,800 proteins per cell, including key macrophage markers and ~500 differentially expressed proteins between tumor and control macrophages. PCA analysis successfully separated these populations, revealing the utility of SCP in capturing biologically relevant signals in the tumor microenvironment.

The process is initiated by cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and evoke a series of early cellular responses including calcium ions (Ca2+) influx, and is conducted by the intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat receptors (NLRs) ADR1s within an EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 module. However, the underlying mechanisms linking PRR signaling to the NLRs ADR1s remain unclear. Here, we show that the Nicotiana benthamiana Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-only protein Stomatal TIR1 (STIR1) produces the immune molecule pRib-AMP, induces formation of EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 complexes, and mediates stomatal immunity. The Inhibitor of Stomatal Immunity C2-domain protein 1 (ISIC1) interacts with and constrains STIR1 function at basal condition, whereas upon pathogen infection, ISIC1 senses Ca2+ signals and de-represses STIR1 signaling.

Telomeric repeat motifs (TRMs), the minimal repeating unit of a telomere, vary from species to species, with some evolutionary clades experiencing a rapid sequence divergence. To explore the full scope of this evolutionary divergence, many bioinformatic tools have been developed to infer novel TRMs using repetitive sequence search on short sequencing reads. However, novel telomeric motifs remain unidentified in up to half of the sequencing libraries assayed with these tools. A possible reason may be that short reads, derived from extensively sheared DNA, preserve little to no positional context of the repetitive sequences assayed. On the other hand, if a sequencing read is sufficiently long, telomeric sequences must appear at either end rather than in the middle. The TeloSearchLR algorithm relies on this to help identify novel TRMs on long reads, in many cases where short-read search tools have failed. In addition, we demonstrate that TeloSearchLR can reveal unusually long telomeric motifs not maintained by telomerase, and it can also be used to anchor terminal scaffolds in new genome assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Commonly used structure-based methods such as giga-docking often fail to rank compounds effectively, and free energy-based approaches, while accurate, are too computationally intensive for large-scale screening. Existing deep learning models struggle to generalize to new targets or drugs, and current evaluation methods do not reflect real-world performance accurately. We introduce BALM, a deep learning framework that predicts binding affinity using pretrained protein and ligand language models. BALM learns experimental binding affinities by optimizing cosine similarity in a shared embedding space. We also propose improved evaluation strategies with diverse data splits and metrics to better assess model performance. Using the BindingDB dataset, BALM shows strong generalization to unseen drugs, scaffolds, and targets. It excels in few-shot scenarios for targets such as USP7 and Mpro, outperforming traditional machine learning and docking methods, including AutoDock Vina. Adoption of the target-based evaluation methods proposed will allow for more stringent evaluation of machine learning-based scoring tools. Frameworks such as BALM show good performance, are computationally efficient, and are highly adaptable within this evaluation setting, making them practical tools for early-stage drug discovery screening.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Here we present crystal structures of human clusterin, revealing a discontinuous three-domain architecture. Structure-based mutational analysis demonstrated that two intrinsically disordered, hydrophobic peptide tails enable diverse clusterin activities. Resembling the N-terminal substrate binding regions of so-called small heat shock proteins, these sequences mediate clusterin's chaperone function in suppressing amyloid-beta tau and alpha-synuclein aggregation. In conjunction with highly conserved surface areas, the tail segments also participate in clusterin binding to very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and cellular uptake. Moreover, the disordered tails cooperate with an adjacent amphipathic helix in lipoprotein formation, but remain accessible for chaperone function in the lipoprotein complex.

In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis is known to increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders. Until recently, characterising the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Using the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq, we sequenced 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24 to 75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% CI = 1.41-1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome, driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq of sperm samples identified over 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 novel) under significant positive selection in the male germline, implicating both activating and loss-of-function mechanisms and diverse cellular pathways. Most positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, while four genes that exhibit elevated frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We find that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2-3 fold elevated risk of known disease-causing mutations in sperm, resulting in 3-5% of sperm from middle-aged to elderly individuals carrying a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on the dynamics of germline mutations and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.","NA","medrxiv",1730671727401

It is used in many algorithms and data structures analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. In a minimizers scheme, the smallest k-mer by some predefined order is selected as the representative of a sequence window containing w consecutive k-mers, which results in overlapping windows often selecting the same k-mer. Minimizers that achieve the smallest number of selected k-mers over a random DNA sequence, termed the expected density, are desired for improved performance of high-throughput sequencing analyses. Yet, no method to date exists to generate minimizers that achieve minimum expected density. Moreover, existing selection schemes fail to achieve low density for values of k and w that are most practical for high-throughput sequencing algorithms and data structures. Here, we present GreedyMini, a novel greedy algorithm to generate minimizers with low expected density. Moreover, we present innovative techniques to transform minimizers from binary to larger alphabets and to larger k values, an extension of GreedyMini to generate minimizers that achieve low density for a particular DNA sequence, and efficient methods to calculate the exact expected density. We combine these innovations into GreedyMini+, a novel method to generate DNA minimizers for practical values of k and w. We demonstrate over various combinations of practical k and w values that GreedyMini+ generates minimizers that achieve expected densities very close to a recent theoretical lower bound, and both expected and particular densities much lower compared to existing selection schemes. We expect GreedyMini+ to improve the performance of many high-throughput sequencing algorithms and data structures and advance the research of k-mer selection schemes.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

The dentate gyrus (DG) is an important brain region in contextual discrimination and disambiguation of new experiences from prior memories. The DG also receives dense projections from the locus coeruleus (LC), the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) in the mammalian brain, which is active during stressful events. However, how noradrenergic dynamics impact DG-dependent function during contextual discrimination and pattern separation remains unclear. Here, we report that aversive contextual processing in mice is linked to linear elevations in tonic norepinephrine release dynamics within the DG and report that this engagement of prolonged norepinephrine release is sufficient to produce contextual disambiguation, even in the absence of a salient aversive stimulus. These findings suggest that spatiotemporal ramping characteristics of LC-NE release in the DG during stress likely serve an important role in driving contextual processing.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Hh signals are transduced via an unusual mechanism: upon agonist-induced phosphorylation, the noncanonical G protein-coupled receptor SMOOTHENED (SMO) binds the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C) and physically blocks its enzymatic activity. By combining computational structural approaches with biochemical and functional studies, we show that SMO mimics strategies prevalent in canonical GPCR and PKA signaling complexes, despite little sequence or secondary structural homology. An intrinsically disordered region of SMO binds the PKA-C active site, resembling the PKA regulatory subunit (PKA-R) / PKA-C holoenzyme, while the SMO transmembrane domain binds a conserved PKA-C interaction hub, similar to other GPCR-effector complexes. In contrast with prevailing GPCR signal transduction models, phosphorylation of SMO promotes intramolecular electrostatic interactions that stabilize key structural elements within the SMO cytoplasmic domain, thereby remodeling it into a PKA-inhibiting conformation. Our work provides a structural mechanism for a central step in the Hh cascade and defines a paradigm for disordered GPCR domains to transmit signals intracellularly.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

One question that arises often in data on natural populations is whether differentiation among populations on a particular trait might be caused in part by natural selection. For the past several decades, researchers have used Q_ST--F_ST approaches to compare the amount of trait differentiation among populations on one or more traits (measured by the statistic Q_ST) with differentiation on genome-wide genetic variants (measured by F_ST). Theory says that under neutrality, F_ST and Q_ST should be approximately equal in expectation, so Q_ST values much larger than F_ST are consistent with local adaptation driving subpopulations' trait values apart, and Q_ST values much smaller than F_ST are consistent with stabilizing selection on similar optima. At the same time, investigators have differed in their definitions of genome-wide F_ST (such as ""ratio of averages"" vs. ""average of ratios"" versions of F_ST) and in their definitions of the variance components in Q_ST. Here, we show that these details matter. Different versions of F_ST and Q_ST have different interpretations in terms of coalescence time, and comparing incompatible statistics can lead to elevated type I error rates, with some choices leading to type I error rates near one when the nominal rate is 5%. We conduct simulations under varying genetic architectures and forms of population structure and show how they affect the distribution of Q_ST. When many loci influence the trait, our simulations support procedures grounded in a coalescent-based framework for neutral phenotytpic differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Here, we report a microchip-based massive in parallel synthesis (mMPS), pioneering an identification-sorting-synthesis-recycling iteration mechanism to microchips for high throughput DNA synthesis. In comparison to microarray-based methods, we demonstrate that our method can increase the DNA product concentration by 4 magnitudes (to picomole-scale per sequence) and greatly simplifies the downstream processes for large-scale gene synthesis construction. By the construction of 1.97 million-diversity variant libraries that cover 1,254 human protein domains, we demonstrated the uniformity of the constructed variant libraries using mMPS-derived oligos is greatly improved, with amino acid distribution highly consistent as designed. In addition, by synthesizing 285 1kb-to-3kb genes with varying degrees of sequence complexity from previously reported strains A501 and 3DAC, potential ancestor of early archaea and bacteria, our result shows that the overall gene assembly success rate using mMPS-derived oligos is increased by 10-fold in comparison to other methods.

Using optical neuroimaging to probe neural activity and hemodynamics in a mouse model of ECT, we demonstrated that a second brain event follows seizure: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD). We further found that ECT stimulation pulse parameters and electrode configuration directly shaped the wave dynamics of seizure and subsequent CSD. To translate these findings to human patients, we tested for the presence of hemodynamic signatures of post-ictal CSD using non-invasive diffuse optical monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during routine ECT treatments. We found evidence that humans generate hyperemic waves after ECT seizure which are highly consistent with CSD. These results challenge a long-held assumption that seizure is the primary outcome of ECT and point to new opportunities for optimizing ECT stimulation parameters to precisely modulate brain activity and treatment outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Historically, the genetics of HF have been studied in Mendelian forms of disease, where rare genetic variants have been linked to familial cardiomyopathies. More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with risk of HF. However, the relative importance of genetic variants across the allele-frequency spectrum remains incompletely characterized. Here, we report the results of common- and rare-variant association studies of all-cause heart failure, applying recently developed methods to quantify the heritability of HF attributable to different classes of genetic variation. We combine GWAS data across multiple populations including 207,346 individuals with HF and 2,151,210 without, identifying 176 risk loci at genome-wide significance (P-value < 5x10-8). Signals at newly identified common-variant loci include coding variants in Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (MYBPC3, BAG3) and in regulators of lipoprotein (LPL) and glucose metabolism (GIPR, GLP1R). These signals are enriched in myocyte and adipocyte cell types and can be clustered into 5 broad modules based on pleiotropic associations with anthropomorphic traits/obesity, blood pressure/renal function, atherosclerosis/lipids, immune activity, and arrhythmias. Gene burden studies across three biobanks (PMBB, UKB, AOU), including 27,208 individuals with HF and 349,126 without, uncover exome-wide significant (P-value < 1.57x10-6) associations for HF and rare predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in TTN, MYBPC3, FLNC, and BAG3. Total burden heritability of rare coding variants (2.2%, 95% CI 0.99-3.5%) is highly concentrated in a small set of Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes, while common variant heritability (4.3%, 95% CI 3.9-4.7%) is more diffusely spread throughout the genome. Finally, we show that common-variant background, in the form of a polygenic risk score (PRS), significantly modifies the risk of HF among carriers of pathogenic truncating variants in the Mendelian cardiomyopathy gene TTN. Together, these findings provide a genetic link between dysregulated metabolism and HF, and suggest a significant polygenic component to HF exists that is not captured by current clinical genetic testing.","NA","medrxiv",1730671727401

Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages use crlRNAs to thwart CRISPR-Cas immunity by inhibiting Cas expression, or to block Abi by silencing an unprecedented RNA toxin that features consecutive proline codons. Remarkably, the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIF24 selectively inhibits Cas proteins loaded with host crRNAs/crlRNAs, while allowing those complexed with viral crlRNAs to synergistically block Abi responses, as viral crlRNAs have co-adaptively evolved shorter spacer sequences. Furthermore, viral crlRNAs frequently organize as multiplexed arrays, mirroring the architecture of bacterial CRISPRs.

Increase in circulating amino acids and lipids, in part due to adipose dysfunction, have been shown to drive obesity-mediated diseases. Similarly, elevated purines and uric acid, a degradation product of purine metabolism, are found in the bloodstream and in adipose tissue. These metabolic changes are correlated with metabolic syndrome, but little is known about the physiological effects of targeting purine biosynthesis. Methods: To determine the effects of purine biosynthesis on organismal health we treated mice with mizoribine, an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IMPDH1/2), key enzymes in this pathway. Mice were fed either a low-fat (LFD; 13.5% kcal from fat) or a high-fat (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) diet for 30 days during drug or vehicle treatment. We ascertained the effects of mizoribine on weight gain, body composition, food intake and absorption, energy expenditure, and overall metabolic health. Results: Mizoribine treatment prevented mice on a HFD from gaining weight, but had no effect on mice on a LFD. Body composition analysis demonstrated that mizoribine significantly reduced fat mass but did not affect lean mass. Although mizoribine had no effect on lipid absorption, food intake was reduced. Furthermore, mizoribine treatment induced adaptive thermogenesis in skeletal muscle by upregulating sarcolipin, a regulator of muscle thermogenesis. While mizoribine-treated mice exhibited less adipose tissue than controls, we did not observe lipotoxicity. Rather, mizoribine-treated mice displayed improved glucose tolerance and reduced ectopic lipid accumulation. Conclusions: Inhibiting purine biosynthesis prevents mice on a HFD from gaining weight, and improves their metabolic health, to a significant degree. We also demonstrated that the purine biosynthesis pathway plays a previously unknown role in skeletal muscle thermogenesis. A deeper mechanistic understanding of how purine biosynthesis promotes thermogenesis and decreases food intake may pave the way to new anti-obesity therapies. Crucially, given that many purine inhibitors have been FDA-approved for use in treating various conditions, our results indicate that they may benefit overweight or obese patients.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

During monsoon, flooding is common in most Indian cities bringing in fecal contamination in storm runoff. Identifying the major driving factors contributing to the elevated levels of AMR in these rivers is essential to combat AMR proliferation. Determining whether the introduction of ARBs and ARGs through fecal pollution or subsequent (co-) selection for ARGs through chemical pollutants is responsible for the rise and spread of AMR is important in mitigation efforts. To achieve this, we targeted two rivers in northern India which received untreated wastewater and assessed the level of two fecal indicators (E. coli and intI1) and wastewater-associated ARGs (ermF, sul1, sul2, and tetW) along with heavy metals (Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn). Water and sediment samples were collected in triplicates at 5-6 locations for each river. Consequently, to evaluate how seasonality affects the ARG levels as well as their drivers in these heavily polluted rivers, sampling campaigns were carried out during three seasons: in summer (pre-monsoon), during monsoon, and post-monsoon in winter. We here demonstrate that the main source for the river resistome in the Bindal and Rispana is the constant inflow of untreated wastewater throughout the year and not the co-selection of ARGs due to the presence of heavy metals. This may be true for many Indian rivers that receive untreated or partially treated wastewater. The rainfall adds to the ARG abundance of the river instead of diluting it. MGE intI1 is more reliable than E. coli as an indicator for fecal pollution and horizontal gene transfer. Heavy metals, despite being present in the river in higher concentrations than the MCSC, no evidence for co-selection was observed.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

We demonstrate the performance of the modified AlphaFold2, referred to as DEERFold, in switching the predicted conformations guided by experimental or simulated distance distributions. Remarkably, the intrinsic performance of AlphaFold2 substantially reduces the number and the accuracy of the widths of the distributions needed to drive conformational selection thereby increasing the experimental throughput. The blueprint of DEERFold can be generalized to other experimental methods where distance constraints can be represented by distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

In this study, we quantify the absolute levels of over 100 nutrients available across multiple tissues in mice and investigate how this relates to the ability of breast cancer cells to grow in different organs. We engineered breast cancer cells with broad metastatic potential to be auxotrophic for specific nutrients and assessed their ability to colonize different organs. We then asked how tumor growth in different tissues relates to nutrient availability and tumor biosynthetic activity. We find that single nutrients alone do not define the sites where breast cancer cells can grow as metastases. Additionally, we identify purine synthesis as a requirement for tumor growth and metastasis across many tissues and find that this phenotype is independent of tissue nucleotide availability or tumor de novo nucleotide synthesis activity. These data suggest that a complex interplay of multiple nutrients within the microenvironment dictates potential sites of metastatic cancer growth, and highlights the interdependence between extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic cellular properties in influencing where breast cancer cells can grow as metastases.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

This phenotype can lead to the survival and regrowth of bacteria after treatment, resulting in relapse of infections. As such, it is also a contributing factor to antibacterial resistance. Multiple processes are believed to cause persister formation, yet identifying the proteins expressed during the induction of the persister state has been difficult, because the persister-state is rare, transient and does not lead to genetic changes. In this study, we used Bio-Orthogonal Non-Canonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) to label, and retrieve, the proteome expressed during the persister state for different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. After incubating antibiotic-exposed bacteria with the methionine ortholog L-azidohomoalanine to label the proteins of persister cells, we retrieved labeled proteins using click chemistry-pulldown methodology. Analysis of the retrieved proteome fraction of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) under challenge with {beta}-lactam and fluoroquinolone antibiotics with Label Free Quantification - Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry  (LFQ-LCMSased proteomics reveals the upregulation of proteins involved in stringent response, cell wall biosynthesis, purine metabolism, ppGpp biosynthesis, two component systems (TCS), lipid metabolism, ABC transporters, d-alanine biosynthesis and L-proline degradation. Conversely, we observed a decline of proteins associated with amino acid biosynthesis and degradation, protein biosynthesis, protein modification, and carbohydrate metabolism, among others.

This ability is hypothesized to depend on sequential planning via step-by-step simulations of the future, using cognitive maps or schemas of task contingencies. However, it is still unclear if, how and where in the brain such flexible planning is enacted. In parallel, it is thought that consolidation transforms memory representations over time to promote adaptive behaviour. Here, we hypothesize that consolidation strengthens cognitive maps of task contingencies used for simulation during sequential planning. To test this, we developed a novel behavioural task and a new multivariate method for analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Using choice and reaction time data we dissociated flexible sequential planning from alternative non-sequential strategies, and identified this behaviour with robust neural markers of step-by-step simulation, localized to the anterior medial temporal lobe. Retesting a week later we showed that consolidation enhanced sequential planning and strengthened markers of sequential simulation in the prefrontal cortex, consistent with systems consolidation theory. By revealing that consolidation improves future simulations for flexible planning we open up a new frontier for the investigation of the functional interactions between memory and decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

For twenty years, the GENCODE consortium has developed reference annotations for the human and mouse genomes, becoming a foundation for biomedical and genomics communities worldwide. Nevertheless, collections of important yet poorly-understood gene classes like long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) remain incomplete and scattered across multiple, uncoordinated catalogs, slowing down progress in the field. To address these issues, GENCODE has undertaken the most comprehensive lncRNAs annotation effort to date. This is founded on the manual annotation of full-length targeted long-read sequencing, on matched embryonic and adult tissues, of orthologous regions in human and mouse. Altogether 17,931 novel human genes (140,268 novel transcripts) and 22,784 novel mouse genes (136,169 novel transcripts) have been added to the GENCODE catalog representing a 2-fold and 6-fold increase in transcripts, respectively - the greatest increase since the sequencing of the human genome. Novel gene annotations display evolutionary constraints, have well-formed promoter regions, and link to phenotype-associated genetic variants. They greatly enhance the functional interpretability of the human genome, as they help explain millions of previously-mapped ""orphan"" omics measurements corresponding to transcription start sites, chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding sites. Crucially, our targeted design assigned human-mouse orthologs at a rate beyond previous studies, tripling the number of human disease-associated lncRNAs with mouse orthologs. The expanded and enhanced GENCODE lncRNA annotations mark a critical step towards deciphering the human and mouse genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

We confirm their localization, observe that they physically interact, and find that neither protein is required for normal membrane morphology.

Previous cerebellar coordinate-based meta-analyses and mappings have attributed different behaviors to cerebellar subareas, but an accurate behavioral topography is lacking. Here, we show overrepresentation of superior activation foci, which may be exacerbated by historical cerebellar neglect. Unequal foci distributions render the null hypothesis of standard activation likelihood estimation unsuitable. Our new method, cerebellum-specific activation-likelihood estimation (C-SALE), finds behavioral convergence beyond baseline activation rates. It does this by testing experimental foci versus null models sampled from a data-driven, biased probability distribution of finding foci at any cerebellar location. Cerebellar mappings were made across five BrainMap task domains and thirty-five subdomains, illustrating improved specificity of the new method. Twelve of forty (sub)domains reached convergence in specific cerebellar subregions, supporting dual motor representations and placing cognition in posterior-lateral regions. Repeated subsampling revealed that whereas action, language and working memory were relatively stable, other behaviors produced unstable meta-analytic maps. Lastly, meta-analytic connectivity modeling in the same debiased framework was used to reveal coactivation networks of cerebellar behavioral clusters. In sum, we created a new method for cerebellar meta-analysis that accounts for data biases and can be flexibly adapted to any part of the brain. Our findings provide a refined understanding of cerebellar involvement in human behaviors, highlighting regions for future investigation in both basic and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Plants lacking PHOT2 flower later than controls when grown in low ambient temperature. This phenotype is blocked by removal of NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3 (NPH3) and recapitulated by reducing blue light intensity or removing the transcription factor CAMTA2. PHOT2 and CAMTA2 show non-additive genetic interactions in phenotype and gene expression. Network-based co-expression analysis indicates system-level control of key growth modules by PHOT2 and CAMTA2.

Comparing the performance of different reference datasets, we found that sample size, and not the relevance of the tissue to the disease, was the critical factor in identifying relevant genes. Genes implicated using a well powered expression dataset were also more likely to have multiple lines of genetic evidence. A targeted proteomics reference dataset from plasma samples showed similar power to identify T2D related proteins as gene expression with the same sample size. Accounting for BMI reduces power across all tissues and phenotypes by ~30%, suggesting that many GWAS links to T2D are mediated by BMI, potentially implicating insulin resistance related effects. Finally, using data from smaller GWAS studies with precisely defined T2D subtypes uncovers genes directly relevant to that subtype, such as LST1, an immune response gene for Severe Autoimmune Diabetes and TRMT2A, involved in beta-cell apoptosis, for Severe Insulin Deficient Diabetes.

Here we took a cross-species approach and estimated neuronal timescales of thousands of single neurons recorded across multiple areas in mice, monkeys, and humans using a task-agnostic method. We identify largely consistent hierarchies of timescales in frontal and limbic regions across species: hippocampus had the shortest timescale whereas anterior cingulate cortex had the longest. Within this scheme, variability across species was found, most notably in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. We show that variation in timescales is not simply related to differences in spiking statistics nor the result of cytoarchitectonic features such as cortical granularity. Thus, hierarchically organized timescales are a consistent organizing principle across species and appear to be related to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

BamA is a central component of the BAM complex. The molecular mechanisms of BamA when the substrate protein is assembled has been well elucidated and further the inhibitors targeting key mechanisms of BamA have been isolated. Although the BAM complex is a multi-subunit machine and its coordination is necessary for full function, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we report on a fine-tuning system with a subunit called BamE, which is required for the cooperation of two essential subunits BamA and BamD. BamE is a lipoprotein with an N-terminal extension region between the lipid-modifying cysteine on the N-terminus and the periplasmic folding domain. Our interaction mapping revealed that the N-terminal extension region of BamE interacts with the {beta}-barrel domain of BamA, which contains a catalytic site for assembly termed lateral gate. The mutational analysis demonstrated that the N-terminal extension region of BamE fine-tunes the assembly stage dependent BamA-BamD interaction, responsible for the crucial role for assembly and integrity of the outer membrane.

The nutrient-rich milk environment supports bacterial growth, but the specific genetic determinants that facilitate S. aureus proliferation and persistence in milk are poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR interference sequencing (CRISPRi-seq) screen to identify fitness determinants essential for S. aureus growth and survival in milk. We identified 282 milk-essential genes, including those with key roles in DNA replication, protein synthesis, and metabolism. Comparative analysis with brain heart infusion (BHI) as growth medium, revealed 79 genes with differential fitness, highlighting specific adaptations required for growth in milk. Notably, we found that purine biosynthesis, folate cycle pathways, and metal acquisition were particularly important in this environment. Based on this, we further demonstrate that S. aureus is more sensitive to the folate inhibitors trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in milk and identify several genes whose knockdown results in hypersensitivity to TMP-SMX in milk. Additionally, our analysis showed a relatively reduced importance of cell wall components, such as teichoic acids, for S. aureus fitness in milk, which is also reflected in reduced efficiency of antimicrobials targeting teichoic acids. Together, these findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of S. aureus fitness and antibiotic susceptibility in milk, offering directions for novel treatment strategies against bovine mastitis.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Trends between the CTPR structural attributes and condensate propensity were recapitulated across different experimental conditions and by in silico modelling, demonstrating that the CTPR domain can systematically affect the condensates in a predictable manner. Moreover, we show that incorporating short binding motifs into the CTPR domain results in specific target-protein recruitment into the condensates. Our model system can be rationally designed in a versatile manner to both tune condensate propensity and endow the condensates with new functions.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

They regulate promoter activity by directly binding cis-regulatory elements in DNA. The angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana contains more than 1,500 annotated transcription factors, each containing a DNA-binding domain that is used to define transcription factor families. Analyzing binding motifs of 686 and the binding sites of 335 A. thaliana transcription factors as well as motifs of 92 transcription factors from other plants, we identified a constrained vocabulary of 74 conserved motifs spanning 50 families in plants. Among 21 transcription factor families, we found one core motif for all analyzed members and between 2 and 72% overlapping binding sites. Five families show conservation of the motif along phylogenetic clades. Five families including the C2H2 zinc finger family show high diversity among motifs in plants, suggesting potential for neofunctionalization of duplicated transcription factors based on the motif recognized. For conserved motifs we tested if they remained conserved since at least 450 million years ago by determining the binding motifs of 17 orthologous transcription factors from 11 families in M. polymorpha using amplified DNA affinity purification sequencing. We detected nearly identical binding motifs as predicted from the angiosperm data. Taken together, the results show a large repertoire of overlapping binding sites within a TF family and species and a high degree of binding motif conservation for at least 450 million years. The results indicate more potential for evolution in cis- rather than trans-regulatory elements.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

A major cause of mortality and morbidity among cystic fibrosis patients, multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa is often targeted with the antibiotic colistin as a last option. However, increasing reports of colistin resistance among P. aeruginosa is a matter of significant concern. Though the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of colistin resistance are well known, the evolutionary trajectory to colistin resistance is an important area of investigation. In this work, using the adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) approach we have evolved a colistin-sensitive P. aeruginosa ancestral strain to a resistant one. During the process of laboratory evolution in 106 generations, colistin MIC was increased 32-fold. The evolved strain had lower fitness than the ancestral strain as evidenced by a lower growth rate and higher doubling time. Moreover, the evolved strain produced more biofilm and less pyocyanin. Interestingly, the evolved strain showed collateral sensitivity to several antibiotics such as co-trimoxazole, rifampicin, kanamycin, tigecycline, penicillin, ampicillin, and teicoplanin. On analysing various TCS modules involved in the development of colistin resistance a novel missense mutation (V136G) was detected in the PmrB sensor kinase. Bioinformatics prediction indicated that the mutation could be deleterious, though the functionality of the PmrB mutant remains to be validated experimentally.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Our findings reveal that calcium transients precede MCC apical emergence and are essential for their successful insertion into the overlying skin epithelium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phospholipase C (PLC) activity is required for the generation of calcium transients, which in turn regulate MCC epithelial integration via the calcium-binding protein calmodulin.

Nevertheless, a major challenge lies in the site-specific attachment of three probes to unique positions within the target protein. Here, we propose an orthogonal triple-labeling strategy that is not compromised by native, reactive amino acid functionalities. It combines genetic code expansion and biorthogonal labeling of two different non-canonical amino-acids with an enzymatic self-labeling SNAP tag.

Currently, we have standard metrics for evaluating model performance (e.g., precision, recall, F1), but these to some extent overlook the ultimate aim of addressing the specific research question to which the model will be applied. As improving performance metrics has diminishing returns, particularly when data is inherently noisy, biologists are often faced with the conundrum of investing more time in maximising performance metrics at the expense of doing the actual research. This leads to the question: how much noise can we accept in our ML models?
C_LIO_LIHere, we start by describing an under-reported source of noise that can cause performance metrics to underestimate true model performance. Specifically, ambiguity between categories or mistakes in labelling of the validation data produces hard ceilings that limit performance metric scores. This common source of error in biological systems means that many models could be performing better than the metrics suggest.
C_LIO_LINext, we argue and show that imperfect models (e.g. low F1 scores) can still useable. We first propose a simulation framework to evaluate the robustness of a model for hypothesis testing. Second, we show how to determine the utility of the models by supplementing existing performance metrics with  biological validations that involve applying ML models to unlabelled data in different ecological contexts for which we can anticipate the outcome.
C_LIO_LITogether, our simulations and case study show that effects sizes and expected biological patterns can be detected even when performance metrics are relatively low (e.g., F1 between 60-70%). In doing so, we provide a roadmap for validation approaches of ML models that are tailored to research in ecology and evolutionary biology.

In the case of antibiotic tolerance, antibiotics fail to kill the bacteria as their phenotypic state affords them protection from the bactericidal activity of the antibiotic. Antibiotic tolerance can affect an entire bacterial population, or a subset of cells known as persister cells. Interaction with the host induces the formation of persister cells in numerous pathogens, with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species production being heavily implicated in the collapse of bacterial energy levels and entrance into an antibiotic tolerant state. Here, we developed a high-throughput screen to identify energy modulators for intracellular Staphylococcus aureus. The identified compound, KL1, increases intracellular bacterial energy and sensitizes the persister population to antibiotics, without causing cytotoxicity or bacterial outgrowth. We demonstrate that KL1 exhibits adjuvant activity in a murine model of S. aureus bacteremia and intracellular infection of Salmonella Typhimurium. Transcriptomic analysis and further studies on its mechanism of action reveal that KL1 modulates host immune response genes and suppresses the production of reactive species in host macrophages, alleviating one of the major stressors that induce antibiotic tolerance. Our findings highlight the potential to target intracellular persister cells by stimulating their metabolism and encourage larger efforts to address antibiotic tolerance at the host-pathogen interface, particularly within the intracellular milieu.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

In this study, we introduce Cap-trap full-length cDNA sequencing (CFC-seq), a comprehensive protocol that combines Cap-trapping and poly(A)-tailing with Oxford Nanopore sequencing. This protocol enables precise identification of TSSs and full-length transcripts. Applying CFC-seq to two in vitro differentiation time courses resulted in approximately 236 million mappable reads.

Using this dataset, enhancer-derived ncRNAs were re-defined with longer length and more splicing activity, which were correlated with enhancer structure. Compared to enhancers with CpG islands, TATA box enhancers were shown to be more cell-type specific with fewer chromatin interaction but produced longer and more stable polyadenylated RNA.

The right stellate ganglion (RSG) predominantly innervates the sinoatrial node and has functional effects on chronotropy/heart rate, whereas the left stellate ganglion (LSG) has predominance in the ventricular myocardium and impacts inotropy/contractility. Whilst the innervation patterns and functional consequences of block and stimulation are well-documented, basic electrophysiological characterisation and single-cell comparison of RSG and LSG neurons has not been performed. In addition, sex differences in stellate ganglion action potential (AP) parameters may exist, but remain as yet unknown. Methods/Results: Here we characterise the electrical properties of enzymatically isolated mouse stellate ganglia neurons using the patch clamp technique. Using 500 ms depolarising pulses of varying amplitude, we provide detailed characterisation of basic AP properties and their correlations. We reveal that there are two populations of neurons in terms of their AP firing properties (phasic or tonic firing), with the majority (67%) firing with a phasic pattern. When all recordings were pooled, tonic neurons had a significantly larger AP amplitude (85 +/- 3.0 vs 76 +/- 2.4 mV) and overshoot (28 +/- 1.8 vs 19 +/- 1.8 mV) compared to phasic neurons (P<0.05). Moreover, phasic neurons did not fire spontaneously, whereas 50% of tonic neurons did, and more often presented with anodal break excitation (P<0.05). When male vs female neurons were compared, males had a more negative minimum diastolic potential (MDP; -55 +/- 1.7 vs -47 +/- 3.0 mV, P<0.05). When LSG vs RSG neurons were compared, the RSG had a more negative resting membrane potential (Vrest; -60 +/- 1.5 vs -54 +/- 1.3 mV, P<0.05). All other AP parameters did not differ significantly between these groups. Conclusions: The RSG and LSG contain a similar proportion of phasic and tonic firing neurons. A significant difference was observed in the Vrest of RSG vs LSG neurons, and in the MDP of male vs female neurons. However, all other AP parameters were similar. This suggests that the LSG and RSG can be combined irrespective of sex when investigating the electrophysiological properties of these distinct anatomical structures in healthy and disease conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

COMBINE revealed diverse synergistic and antagonistic interactions between epigenetic protein domains, including a potent KRAB-L3MBTL3 fusion that enhanced gene silencing up to 34-fold in dose-limited conditions and enabled robust bidirectional CRISPR perturbation. Inducible screening showed DNA methylation modifiers are essential for epigenetic memory, with distinct combinations driving long-term silencing, repression, or activation. Notably, we identified TET1-based combinations that induce hit-and-run upregulation for over 50 days, demonstrating long-term transcriptional activation. This systematic analysis of pairwise domain interactions provides a rich resource for understanding epigenetic crosstalk and developing next-generation epigenome editing tools. More broadly, COMBINE offers a generalizable platform to functionally characterize combinatorial biological processes at scale.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

To identify pathways that are essential under fluoroquinolone stress and thus might represent novel targets to revitalize the use of this class of antibiotics, we performed genome-wide CRISPRi-seq screens to determine antibiotic-gene essentiality signatures. As expected, genes involved in DNA recombination and repair become more important under fluoroquinolone-induced DNA damage, such as recA, recJ, recF, recO, rexAB and ruvAB. Surprisingly, we also found that specific downregulation of the gene encoding the histidine kinase LiaS caused fluoroquinolone hypersensitivity. LiaS is part of the LiaFSR (VraTSR) three-component regulatory system involved in cell envelope homeostasis. We show that LiaS keeps the response regulator LiaR inactive, and that deletion of liaS causes hyperphosphorylation of LiaR and subsequent upregulation of the LiaR regulon. RNA-seq was used to refine the LiaR regulon, highlighting the role of the heat-shock response and the pleiotropic regulator SpxA2 in fluoroquinolone sensitivity. Activating the LiaR-regulon by the cell envelope-targeting antibiotic bacitracin synergized with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. This synergistic antibiotic combination restored sensitivity in fluoroquinolone-resistant strains in vitro. Importantly, bacitracin/levofloxacin combination therapy was also effective in vivo and improved the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae infection in a zebrafish meningitis model. Together, the approaches and findings presented here provides a starting point for identification and validation of potent combination therapies that could be used in the clinic to treat antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal infections.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Here we review magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies assessing structural and functional brain associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms in insomnia disorder (ID; n=38), insomnia symptoms in depressive and anxiety disorders (n=14), and these symptoms in the general populations (n=2). The studies on insomnia disorder consistently showed overlapping (salience network: insula and anterior cingulate cortex) and differential MRI correlation patterns between depressive (thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex and its associated functional connectivity) and anxiety (functional connectivity associated with default mode network) symptoms. The insula was also consistently identified as indicating the severity of insomnia symptoms in depressive disorder. In contrast, findings for other regions related to insomnia symptoms in both depressive and anxiety disorders were generally inconsistent across studies, partly due to variations in methods and patient cohorts. In the general population, brain regions in the default mode network provided a functional link between insomnia and depressive symptoms. These findings underscore both the shared and distinct neural correlates among depression, anxiety, and insomnia, providing potential avenues for the clinical management of these conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1730671727401

While traditional approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely-related ([~]11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans, which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Despite this well-known link, we still know little about underlying age-related epigenetic differences, which could help us better understand inter-individual variation in aging and the etiology, onset, and progression of age-associated disease. Dogs exhibit this negative correlation between size, health, and longevity and thus represent an excellent system in which to test the underlying mechanisms. Here, we quantified genome-wide DNA methylation in a cohort of 864 dogs in the Dog Aging Project. Age strongly patterned the dog epigenome, with the majority (66% of age-associated loci) of regions associating age-related loss of methylation. These age effects were non-randomly distributed in the genome and differed depending on genomic context. We found the LINE1 (long interspersed elements) class of TEs (transposable elements) were the most frequently hypomethylated with age (FDR < 0.05, 40% of all LINE1 regions). This LINE1 pattern differed in magnitude across breeds of different sizes- the largest dogs lost 0.26% more LINE1 methylation per year than the smallest dogs. This suggests that epigenetic regulation of TEs, particularly LINE1s, may contribute to accelerated age and disease phenotypes within a species. Since our study focused on the methylome of immune cells, we looked at LINE1 methylation changes in golden retrievers, a breed highly susceptible to hematopoietic cancers, and found they have accelerated age-related LINE1 hypomethylation compared to other breeds. We also found many of the LINE1s hypomethylated with age are located on the X chromosome and are, when considering X chromosome inactivation, counter-intuitively more methylated in males. These results have revealed the demethylation of LINE1 transposons as a potential driver of inter-species, demographic-dependent aging variation.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

Here, we present an encoder-only transformer model for assembly polishing called DeepPolisher, which predicts corrections to the underlying sequence using Pacbio HiFi read alignments to a diploid assembly.

Using large-scale electrophysiology and projection-specific optotagging across multiple frontal regions, we identified distinct spatial gradients for these variables, with stronger expected value coding in dorsal regions and stronger risk coding in medial regions. We then demonstrated that this encoding further depends on the neuronal projections: frontal neurons projecting to the dorsomedial striatum and claustrum differentially encoded economic variables. Our findings illustrate that frontal cortical representation of economic variables is jointly determined by spatial organization and downstream connectivity of neurons, revealing a structured, multi-scale code for economic variables.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

While specific interactions between motifs delineate cell type relationships within families, surprisingly, these interactions are not conserved between species. Consistently, while deep learning models trained on one species can predict accessibility of other species sequences, their predictions frequently rely on distinct, but synonymous, motif combinations.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1730671727401

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1730671727401
