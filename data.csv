Somitogenesis, the rhythmic segmentation of vertebrate embryos, is governed by signalling gradients and oscillations in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM)1,2, but the corresponding protein dynamics are largely unknown. Perturbations in this process cause congenital spine disorders and can result in embryonic lethality3. Here, we introduce an integrated proteomics and microfluidics approach to resolve spatiotemporal protein expression in the developing mouse tail. To this end, we established a microfluidic system to synchronize oscillations in embryo tails grown in 3D, which we combined with mass-spectrometry and RNA sequencing. We uncover novel oscillatory proteins and differentially expressed genes along the anteroposterior axis. Building on this dataset, we identify a previously unrecognized antagonistic, dynamic ligand-receptor expression pattern in R-Spondin/LGR signalling explaining how Wnt-oscillation amplitude increases despite decreasing ligand levels in anterior PSM. Dynamic ligand expression was validated in mouse gastruloids. Perturbation of ligand dynamics reduced oscillation amplitude and impaired somite formation. Our study reveals a novel regulatory strategy in which dynamic antagonistic gradients fine-tune signalling strength, providing new mechanistic insight into how protein dynamics control tissue patterning. We anticipate our dataset to serve as foundation for mechanistic investigations of mammalian somitogenesis including the role of mechanics and metabolism. More broadly, our approach combining microfluidics-based synchronization of signalling in multicellular systems with omics analyses can be applied to study dynamics in other contexts such as in tissue homeostasis4 and regeneration5.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757542066613

However, current sample preparation methods are largely inherited from visible light or electron microscopy workflows and hence are not optimised to exploit the full potential of X-ray contrast mechanisms. Here we propose to replace interstitial material by air to enhance X-ray phase contrast of the ultrastructural features. We used critical point drying (CPD) of heavy metal-stained mouse brain tissue to produce mechanically stable samples with preserved ultrastructure and enhanced refractive index boundaries, a nanofoam-like material that remains compatible with follow-up conventional resin embedding. Using two complementary synchrotron-based setups, a high-throughput microtomography beamline (P14, DESY) and a nanoscale holographic tomography beamline (ID16A, ESRF), we found that CPD samples consistently showed 2-4x stronger phase-shift signal than conventional resin-embedded tissue. The contrast gain remained consistent across samples, imaging conditions, and beamlines. Our results suggest that CPD offers a generalisable route for preparing tissue for high-resolution X-ray imaging. It retains structural detail while improving signal, and is compatible with other processing procedures like femtosecond laser milling or electron microscopy, paving the path for large-scale biological tissue imaging.","[{""name"":""Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01js2sh04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""XIMG-13;""},{""name"":""European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02550n020"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS3231;IHMA106;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;110174/Z/15/Z;EP/W024292/1;""},{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/W024292/1;EP/V007661/1;""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101094250;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""852455;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757542066613

Comparative transcriptomic analysis of mucus-associated versus supernatant Bacteroides populations unveiled small RNAs (sRNAs) that are differentially regulated between spatially segregated subpopulations. Among these, we identified IroR as a key sRNA that facilitates B. thetaiotaomicron adaptation to the mucus-rich, iron-limiting niche, partly by modulating expression of bacterial capsule genes.

Exciton dynamics within LH2 complexes are controlled by the structural arrangement and energy levels of the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and carotenoid (Car) pigments. However, there is still debate over the competing light-harvesting versus energy-dissipation pathways. In this work, we compared five variants of the LH2 complex from genetically modified strains of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, all containing the same BChls but different Cars with increasing conjugation: zeta-carotene (N=7; LH2Zeta), neurosporene (N=9; LH2Neu), spheroidene (N=10; LH2Spher), lycopene (N=11; LH2Lyco), and spirilloxanthin (N=13; LH2Spir). Absorption measurements confirmed that Car excited state energy decreased with increasing conjugation. Similarly, fluorescence spectra showed that the B850 BChl emission peak had an increasing red shift from LH2Zeta[-&gt;](LH2Neu/LH2Spher)[-&gt;]LH2Lyco[-&gt;]LH2Spir. In contrast, time-resolved fluorescence and ultrafast transient absorption (fs-TA) revealed similar excited state lifetimes (~1 ns) for all complexes except LH2Spir (~0.7 ns). From fs-TA analysis, an additional ~7 ps non-radiative dissipation step from B850 BChl was observed for LH2Zeta. Further, singlet-singlet and singlet-triplet annihilation studies showed a ~50% average fluorescence lifetime reduction in LH2Zeta at high laser power and high repetition rate, compared to ~10-15% reductions in LH2Neu/LH2Spher/LH2Lyco and minimal lifetime change in LH2Spir. In LH2Zeta, the fastest decay component (<50 ps) became prominent at high repetition rates, consistent with strong singlet-triplet annihilation. Nanosecond TA measurements revealed long-lived (>40 s) BChl triplet states in LH2Zeta and signs of damage caused by singlet oxygen, whereas other LH2s showed faster triplet quenching (~18 ns) by Cars. These findings highlight a key design principle of LH2 complexes: the Car triplet energy must be significantly lower than the BChl triplet energy to efficiently quench BChl triplets that otherwise act as potent ""trap states"" causing exciton annihilation in laser-based experiments or photo-damage in native membranes.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W004593/1;BB/W005719/1;BB/R000174/1;""},{""name"":""Royal Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wnrjx87"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""URFR241006;""},{""name"":""Office of Basic Energy Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mg91w61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0018097;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""564394927;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757542066613

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

To reveal how these processes are mechanistically linked, we combined acute molecule perturbations in live cells with correlative 3D electron tomography or MINFLUX super-resolution microscopy. We show that degrading Nup62 during mitosis arrests NPC assembly at an intermediate step with smaller membrane pores and removes the whole central transport channel. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that 32 copies of the central channel subcomplex, recruited into the previously unoccupied pore center, can self-associate via hydrophobic interactions to occupy the volume required for full pore size and exert an outward pushing force; indeed, disrupting these interactions during NPC assembly blocked pore dilation. Later in mitotic exit, perturbed cells exhibited impaired nuclear import, smaller nuclei, and looser NE spacing. Acute inhibition of nuclear import recapitulated these NE defects without affecting NPC assembly. Together, our findings reveal a new, two-step molecular mechanism linking NPC assembly and NE reformation. First, hydrophobic FG-nucleoporins dilate the assembling nuclear pore to its full width by forming the central transport channel, which then allows nuclear import-driven nuclear expansion leading to tight, regular NE membrane spacing.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project-ID 511488495 - SFB 1638, P06;""},{""name"":""Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH/NIGMS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM083960;P41GM109824;R01GM112108;F32GM150243;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tx8dq56"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757542066613

EXPAND focuses on a core set of 12 nuclear pathologist-interpretable features (NPIFs), composing the Nottingham grading criteria used by the pathologists. It is a fully automated, end-to-end diagnostic workflow, which automatically extracts NPIFs given a patient tumor slide and uses them to predict tumor subtype and survival. EXPANDs performance is comparable to that of existing deep learning non-interpretable black box AI models. It achieves areas under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.73, 0.79 and 0.75 for predicting HER2+, HR+ and TNBC tumor subtypes, respectively, matching the performance of proprietary models that rely on substantially larger and more complex interpretable feature sets. The 12 NPIFs demonstrate strong and independent prognostic value for patient survival, underscoring their potential as biologically grounded, interpretable biomarkers for survival stratification in BC.

As expected, deeper sleep was associated with reduced cortical activation, reflected in a lower high-to-low frequency power ratio. Yet, this relationship weakened in the presence of dreaming, indicating that immersive conscious experiences can counteract the impact of cortical activation on perceived depth. Indeed, perceived sleep depth was lowest during states with a mere sense of presence and highest during immersive dreaming or deep unconsciousness. Across the night, physiological sleep pressure and subjective sleepiness declined, but perceived sleep depth rose alongside increasing dream immersiveness. These results challenge the view that deep sleep stems solely from reduced brain activity and suggest that immersive dreaming sustains perceived sleep depth as homeostatic pressure wanes.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""948891;""},{""name"":""Ministero dell'UniversitÃ  e della Ricerca"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R2049C8YN3;2022BNE97C;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757542066613

One of these proteins is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is responsible for replicating the viral genome. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a well-studied ssRNA+ virus, encodes a membrane-bound RdRp, here termed NS5B, that can form oligomers. NS5B exists in two conformations; only one is believed to be capable of binding RNA. The relationship between membrane localization, oligomerization, and conformation remains unclear. We investigated whether membrane localization mediates NS5B's oligomerization, conformation and function. In solution, NS5B exhibited temperature-dependent oligomerization that correlated with cooperative RNA binding and a conformational shift at micromolar concentrations. In contrast, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that membrane-bound NS5B forms stable, non-terminating oligomers at nanomolar concentrations, often localized near lipid raft domains. The presence of oligomers was correlated with membrane recruitment of RNA and nucleotides, suggesting functional activation. The lower concentration threshold for RNA binding on membranes may be explained by membrane-induced oligomerization that promotes the RNA-binding conformation of NS5B. Our findings are consistent with a model in which membrane association regulates NS5B's function through oligomerization-driven conformational control.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21AI148972;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757542066613

Although all-atom structure prediction models like AlphaFold3 (AF3), Boltz-1, Chai-1, DiffDock, and RosettaFold-All Atom (RFAA) were validated on protein-small molecule complexes, no benchmark or evaluation exists specifically for noncovalent protein-carbohydrate docking. To address this, we developed a high-quality dataset of experimental structures - Benchmark of CArbohydrate Protein Interactions (BCAPIN). Using BCAPIN and a novel evaluation metric, DockQC, we assessed the performance of all-atom structure prediction models on non-covalent protein-carbohydrate docking. We found all methods achieved comparable results, with an 85% success rate for structures of at least acceptable quality. However, we found that the predictive power of all models declined with increasing carbohydrate polymer length. With the capabilities and limitations assessed, we evaluated AF3s ability to predict binding for a set of putative human carbohydrate binding and carbohydrate non-binding proteins. While current models show promise, further development is needed to enable high-confidence, high-throughput prediction of the complete protein-sugar interactome.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35-GM141881;R01-AI162381;T32-GM008403;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2108660;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757542066613

The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis (PPH) is the first comprehensive predictive coding model explaining ASMRs underlying neural mechanism. PPH posits that near-field acoustic cues from common ASMR triggers (e.g., brushing sounds, whispered speech) engage the audio-tactile Peripersonal Space Network, generating a top-down prediction of gentle C-tactile (CT) touch on CT fibre-rich skin of the scalp and neck. This prediction suppresses locus coeruleus (LC) arousal and increases vagal output, offering a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenons therapeutic benefits. In a subjective-experience survey (N = 64), ASMR-labelled trials were rated significantly more pleasant but only slightly more arousing than controls. Pleasantness predicted both the presence and intensity of tingles, supporting PPHs core claim that hedonic value, rather than sympathetic activation, drives the graded somatosensory response. PPH situates ASMR within the Neurovisceral Integration framework, predicting measurable Central Nervous System-Autonomic Nervous System (CNS-ANS) markers (beta-band desynchronisation in the posterior insula and proportional increases in high-frequency heart rate variability with tingle intensity). It further predicts reduced LC activity during ASMR, stronger effects in individuals with high interoceptive prediction error (e.g., anxiety, autism), and attenuation of tingles when spatial proximity cues are removed. By integrating auditory proximity, CT-touch anticipation, and autonomic regulation into a single predictive-coding account, PPH provides a unified, testable framework for explaining ASMR, offering a blueprint for translating this sensory phenomenon into targeted, evidence-based interventions for anxiety and sleep disorders.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757542066613

As such, taxonomic identification often becomes a bottleneck in tropical forest inventories. Here we present a drone-based workflow to automatically acquire large volumes of close-up, ultra-high resolution photos of selected tree crowns (or specific locations over the canopy) to support tropical botanical and ecological studies (https://youtu.be/80goMEifpc4). Our workflow is built around the small, easy-to-use DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise (M3E) drone, which is equipped with a wide-angle and a telephoto camera. On day one, the pilot maps a forest area of up to [~]200 ha with the wide-angle camera to generate a high-resolution digital surface model (DSM) and orthomosaic using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. On subsequent days, the pilot acquires close-up photos with the telephoto camera from up to 300 selected canopy trees per day. These close-up photos are acquired from 6 m above the canopy and contain a high level of visual detail that allows botanists to reliably identify many tree and liana species. The photos are geolocated with survey-grade accuracy using RTK GNSS, thus facilitating spatial co-registration with other data sources, including the photogrammetry products. The primary operational challenge of our workflow is the need to maintain RTK corrections with the drone to ensure that close-up photos are acquired exactly at the predefined locations. The maximum operational range we achieved was 3 km, which would allow the pilot to reach any tree within a [~]2800 ha area from the take-off point. Although our workflow was developed to support taxonomic identification of tropical trees and lianas, it could be extended to any other forest or vegetation type to support botanical, phenological, and ecological studies. We provide harpia, an open-source Python library to program these automatic close-up photo missions with the M3E drone (https://github.com/traitlab/harpia).

Data/code for peer review statementWe provide harpia, an open-source Python library to program these automatic close-up photo missions (https://github.com/traitlab/harpia). Drone imagery and labelled close-up photo data are not yet publicly available because they were acquired with the goal of publishing benchmark machine learning datasets and models for tree and liana species classification and prior publication of the data would jeopardize this future publication.","[{""name"":""IVADO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRF3: AI, Biodiversity, and Climate Change;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2019-04537;""},{""name"":""Population Biology Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Ceiba Fund;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757542066613

Euchromatin and heterochromatin associated histone modifications separate the genome into opposing nuclear compartments. Whereas heterochromatin marks are known to spread from one modified nucleosome to another, no such ability has been ascribed to euchromatin. Using mono-allelic enhancer deletions, native ChIP-seq, and an engineered interaction between an enhancer and transcriptionally inert DNA, we show that enhancers mediate the acquisition of euchromatin features at distal regions through chromatin looping. We term this phenomenon euchromatin hopping and found it occurring on average [~]270kb bidirectionally from enhancers, redefining our understanding of enhancer-mediated chromatin architecture with implications on enhancer identification using chromatin features.

Graphical AbstractO_ST_ABSEuchromatin hopping modelC_ST_ABSFigure showing the proposed euchromatin hopping model. TFs recognize and bind to their binding sites in an active enhancer region. Upon activation enhancers recruit coactivators and RNAPII forming a condensate that supports gene activation. After an abundance of transcriptional machinery and coactivators are recruited, adjacent TF bound sites acquire euchromatin features through physical proximity to the active compartment, we call these regions ""bystanders"". Upon enhancer deletion, condensate formation is lost and active euchromatin marks are not acquired at the gene promoter or other enhancer chromatin contacts. TFs are displayed in yellow, coactivators in green, RNAPII in pink, and histone modifications in red.
