However, if cellular environment is the only determinant of glycosylation, all sites should receive the same glycans on average. This template-free assertion is inconsistent with observations of microheterogeneity-wherein each site receives distinct and reproducible glycan structures. Here, we test the assumption of template-free glycan biosynthesis. Through structural analysis of site-specific glycosylation data, we find protein-sequence and structural features that predict specific glycan features. To quantify these relationships, we present a new amino acid substitution matrix that describes glycoimpact-how glycosylation varies with protein structure. High-glycoimpact amino acids co-evolve with glycosites, and glycoimpact is high when estimates of amino acid conservation and variant pathogenicity diverge. We report hundreds of disease variants near glycosites with high-glycoimpact, including several with known links to aberrant glycosylation (e.g., Oculocutaneous Albinism, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker, and Gaucher's Disease). Finally, we validate glycoimpact quantification by studying oligomannose-complex glycan ratios on HIV ENV, differential sialylation on IgG3 Fc, differential glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 Spike, and fucose-modulated function of a tuberculosis monoclonal antibody. In all, we show glycan biosynthesis is accurately guided by specific, genetically-encoded rules, and this presents a plausible refutation to the assumption of template-free glycosylation.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599997

Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequencing reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide similarity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequencing reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10-5 to 10-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

To benefit navigation, this representation must be dynamically related to surrounding locations. A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal's path has been described in place cells, where the sequence of spikes within each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal's current location towards upcoming locations. In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms as the animal approaches the choice point, raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials. However, to bridge the animal's path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats, that within individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal's location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps were accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells with putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive gridxdirection cells. Sweeps extended into never-visited locations that were inaccessible to the animal and persisted during REM sleep. Sweep directions could be explained by an algorithm that maximizes cumulative coverage of surrounding space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left-right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal-hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient 'look-around' mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

LiftOn's protein-centric algorithm considers both types of alignments, chooses optimal open reading frames, resolves overlapping gene loci, and finds additional gene copies where they exist. LiftOn can reliably transfer annotation between genomes representing members of the same species, as we demonstrate on human, mouse, honey bee, rice, and Arabidopsis thaliana.

Heterotrophic flagellates, often branching deeply in phylogenetic trees, are arguably the most diverse eukaryotes. However, many of them remain undersampled and/or incertae sedis. Here, we conducted comprehensive phylogenomics analyses with an expanded taxon sampling of early-branching protists including 22 newly sequenced transcriptomes (apusomonads, ancyromonads, Meteora). They support the monophyly of Opimoda, one of the largest eukaryotic supergroups, with CRuMs being sister to the Amorphea (amoebozoans, breviates, apusomonads, and opisthokonts -including animals and fungi-), and the ancyromonads+malawimonads clade. By mapping traits onto this phylogenetic framework, we infer a biflagellate opimodan ancestor with an excavate-like feeding groove. Breviates and apusomonads retained the ancestral biflagellate state. Other Amorphea lost one or both flagella, enabling the evolution of amoeboid shapes, novel feeding modes, and palintomic cell division resulting in multinucleated cells, which likely facilitated the subsequent evolution of fungal and metazoan multicellularity.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

Here, we benchmarked the commercial ""Twist Ancient DNA"" reagent from Twist Biosciences using sequencing libraries from ancestrally diverse ancient human samples with low to high endogenous DNA content (0.1-44%). For each library, we tested one and two rounds of enrichment, and assessed performance compared to deep shotgun sequencing. We find that the ""Twist Ancient DNA"" assay provides robust enrichment of ~1.2M target SNPs without introducing allelic bias that may interfere with downstream population genetics analyses. Additionally, we show that pooling up to 4 sequencing libraries and performing two rounds of enrichment is both reliable and cost-effective for libraries with less than 27% endogenous DNA content. Above 38% endogenous content, a maximum of one round of enrichment is recommended for cost-effectiveness and to preserve library complexity. In conclusion, we provide researchers in the field of human paleogenomics with a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of different sequencing and enrichment strategies, and our results offer practical guidance for optimising experimental protocols.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

These neurological symptoms frequently persist for months (post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 or PASC). The molecular origins of neuro-COVID and how it contributes to PASC are unknown, however a growing body of research highlights that the self-assembly of protein fragments from SARS-CoV-2 into amyloid nanofibrils may play a causative role. Previously, we identified two fragments from the proteins Open Reading Frame 6 (ORF6) and ORF10 that self-assemble into neurotoxic amyloid assemblies. Here we further our understanding of the self-assembly mechanisms and nano-architectures formed by these fragments as well as performing a more in-depth study of the biological responses of co-cultured neurons. By solubilising the peptides in a fluorinated solvent we eliminate insoluble aggregates in the starting materials (seeds) that change the polymorphic landscape of the assemblies. The resultant assemblies are dominated by structures with higher free energies (e.g. ribbons and amorphous aggregates) that are less toxic to cultured neurons. We also show the first direct evidence of cellular uptake by viral amyloids. This work highlights the importance of understanding the polymorphic behaviour of amyloids particularly in the context of neuro-COVID and PASC.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

How somatic and germ cells interact to develop and maintain fertility is not well understood. Here, using grafting experiments and transgenic reporter animals, we find that a specific part of the gonad-the germinal zone-acts as a sexual organizer to induce and maintain de novo germ cells and somatic gonads in non-sexual tissue in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. We further show that germ cells express a novel member of the BMP family (Gonadless, Gls) that induces somatic gonad morphogenesis. Loss of Gls resulted in animals lacking somatic gonadal structures but having few, non-proliferative germ cells. We propose a model according to which a small number of primary germ cells drive gonad development though Gls morphogen secretion. The germinal zone in the newly formed gonad, in turn, provides positive feedback to induce secondary germ cells by activating Tfap2 (the master regulator of germ cell fate) in resident pluripotent stem cells.

Understanding the precise pharmacological mechanisms of neuroactive compounds is critical for advancing basic neurobiology and neuropharmacology, as well as for developing more effective treatments for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, integrating modern tools for assessing neural activity in large-scale neural networks with spatially localized drug delivery remains a major challenge. Here, we present a dual microfluidic-photometry platform that enables simultaneous intracranial drug delivery with neural dynamics monitoring in the rodent brain. The integrated platform combines a wireless, battery-free, miniaturized fluidic microsystem with optical probes, allowing for spatially and temporally specific drug delivery while recording activity-dependent fluorescence using genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), neurotransmitter sensors GRABNE and GRABDA, and neuropeptide sensors. We demonstrate the performance this platform for investigating neuropharmacological mechanisms in vivo and characterize its efficacy in probing precise mechanistic actions of neuroactive compounds across several rapidly evolving neuroscience domains.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

It is debated whether these differ based primarily on culturally specific, learned features, or if acoustical features can reliably distinguish them. We study the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of vocalizations produced by 369 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies across six continents. Specific ranges of spectral and temporal modulations, overlapping within categories and across societies, significantly differentiate speech from song. Machine-learning classification shows that this effect is cross-culturally robust, vocalizations being reliably classified solely from their spectro-temporal features across all 21 societies. Listeners unfamiliar with the cultures classify these vocalizations using similar spectro-temporal cues as the machine learning algorithm. Finally, spectro-temporal features are better able to discriminate song from speech than a broad range of other acoustical variables, suggesting that spectro-temporal modulation--a key feature of auditory neuronal tuning--accounts for a fundamental difference between these categories.

Although it can be effective to search the entire map to find the best placement of a component, the process can be slow when the maps are large. However, frequently there is a well-founded hypothesis about where particular components are located. In such cases, a local search using a map subvolume will be much faster because the search volume is smaller, and more sensitive because optimizing the search volume for the rotation search step enhances signal-to-noise. A Fourier-space likelihood-based local search approach, based on the previously-published em_placement software, has been implemented in the new emplace_local program. Tests confirm that the local search approach enhances speed and sensitivity of the computations.

To understand the neural signature of these states, we performed cortex-wide measurements of neural activity in mice making auditory decisions. The trial-averaged magnitude of neural activity was similar in the two states. However, the trial-to-trial variance in neural activity was higher during disengagement. To understand this increased variance, we trained separate linear encoding models on neural data from each state. The models demonstrated that although task variables and task-aligned movements impacted neural activity similarly during the two states, movements that are independent of task events explained more variance during disengagement. Behavioral analyses uncovered that during disengagement, movements become uncoupled to task events. Taken together, these results argue that the neural signature of disengagement, though obscured in trial-averaged neural activity, is evident in trial-to-trial variability driven by changing patterns of spontaneous movements.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

Despite the progress in mapping protein-protein interactions we lack knowledge of how they differ between tissues. Due to coordinated (post)transcriptional control, protein complex members have highly correlated abundances that are predictive of functional association. Here, we have compiled 7873 proteomic samples measuring protein levels in 11 human tissues and use these to define an atlas with tissue-specific protein associations. This method recapitulates known protein complexes and the larger structural organization of the cell. Interactions of stable protein complexes are well preserved across tissues, while signaling and metabolic interactions show larger variation. Further, we find that less than 18% of differences between tissues are estimated to be due to differences in gene expression while cell-type specific cellular structures, such as synaptic components, represent a significant driver of differences between tissues. We further supported the brain protein association network through co-fractionation experiments in synaptosomes, curation of brain derived pull-down data and AlphaFold2 models.

Upon DNA-binding, cGAS generates cGAMP, which binds to STING, ultimately driving inflammatory signalling. Although normally silenced on self-DNA, cGAS can be activated during genotoxic stress. A universal by-product of these conditions are micronuclei, which accumulate cGAS, and which are therefore thought to be major cGAS activators. However, due to the inability to visualise cGAS activation in single cells, this hypothesis remains largely untested. Here we solve this question with an improved intracellular cGAMP reporter, which is compatible with microscopy, flow-cytometry and plate reader setups. Surprisingly, cGAS activation in response to multiple types of genotoxic stress is limited to a subfraction of cells and does not correlate with cGAS enrichment in micronuclei. Overall, our findings suggest a revised model of innate immune signalling in response to genotoxic stress, and introduce a novel and flexible tool with which to examine this model in future.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

We show that spaced learning increases the similarity of human ventromedial prefrontal cortex representations across stimulus encounters and, critically, these increases parallel and predict the behavioral benefits of spacing. Additionally, we show that these spacing benefits critically depend on remembering and, in turn, 're-encoding' past experience.

ObjectiveIdentify DNA methylation (DNAm) changes associated with antidepressant exposure.

DesignCase-control methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) of antidepressant exposure were performed from blood samples collected between 2006-2011 in Generation Scotland (GS). The summary statistics were tested for enrichment in specific tissues, gene ontologies and an independent MWAS in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). A methylation profile score (MPS) was derived and tested for its association with antidepressant exposure in eight independent cohorts, alongside prospective data from GS.

SettingCohorts; GS, NESDA, FTC, SHIP-Trend, FOR2107, LBC1936, MARS-UniDep, ALSPAC, E-Risk, and NTR.

ParticipantsParticipants with DNAm data and self-report/prescription derived antidepressant exposure.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Whole-blood DNAm levels were assayed by the EPIC/450K Illumina array (9 studies, Nexposed = 661, Nunexposed= 9,575) alongside MBD-Seq in NESDA (Nexposed= 398, Nunexposed= 414). Antidepressant exposure was measured by self- report and/or antidepressant prescriptions.

ResultsThe self-report MWAS (N = 16,536, Nexposed = 1,508, mean age = 48, 59% female) and the prescription-derived MWAS (N = 7,951, Nexposed = 861, mean age = 47, 59% female), found hypermethylation at seven and four DNAm sites (p < 9.42x10-8), respectively. The top locus was cg26277237 (KANK1, pself-report= 9.3x10-13, pprescription = 6.1x10-3). The self-report MWAS found a differentially methylated region, mapping to DGUOK-AS1 (padj = 5.0x10-3) alongside significant enrichment for genes expressed in the amygdala, the ""synaptic vesicle membrane"" gene ontology and the top 1% of CpGs from the NESDA MWAS (OR = 1.39, p < 0.042). The MPS was associated with antidepressant exposure in meta-analysed data from external cohorts (Nstudies= 9, N = 10,236, Nexposed = 661, f3 = 0.196, p < 1x10-4).

Conclusions and RelevanceAntidepressant exposure is associated with changes in DNAm across different cohorts. Further investigation into these changes could inform on new targets for antidepressant treatments.

3 Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs antidepressant exposure associated with differential whole blood DNA methylation?

FindingsIn this methylome-wide association study of 16,536 adults across Scotland, antidepressant exposure was significantly associated with hypermethylation at CpGs mapping to KANK1 and DGUOK-AS1. A methylation profile score trained on this sample was significantly associated with antidepressant exposure (pooled f3 [95%CI]=0.196 [0.105, 0.288], p < 1x10-4) in a meta-analysis of external datasets.

MeaningAntidepressant exposure is associated with hypermethylation at KANK1 and DGUOK-AS1, which have roles in mitochondrial metabolism and neurite outgrowth. If replicated in future studies, targeting these genes could inform the design of more effective and better tolerated treatments for depression.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599997

In eukaryotes, loop-extruding SMC complexes form topologically associating domains (TADs) by being stalled by roadblock proteins. It remains unclear whether a similar mechanism of domain formation exists in prokaryotes. Using high-resolution chromosome conformation capture sequencing, we show that an archaeal homolog of the bacterial Smc-ScpAB complex organizes the genome of Thermococcus kodakarensis into TAD-like domains. We also find that TrmBL2, a nucleoid- associated protein that forms a stiff nucleoprotein filament, stalls the T. kodakarensis SMC complex and establishes a boundary at the site-specific recombination site dif. TrmBL2 stalls the SMC complex at tens of additional non-boundary loci with lower efficiency. Intriguingly, the stalling efficiency is correlated with structural properties of underlying DNA sequences. Our study illuminates not only a eukaryotic-like mechanism of domain formation in archaea, but also an unforeseen role of intrinsic DNA structure in large-scale genome organization.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, .1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599997

However, adding new variables, such as sediment, can create methodological biases, such as artificial anatomical character loss during exhumation. Non-invasive in situ imaging techniques such as X-ray computed tomography (XCT scanning) could mitigate this, but the consequences of exposing carcasses to X-rays are not fully understood, and evidence regarding the impact of X-rays on internal microbial faunas that drive decay is conflicting. Here, we test whether XCT scanning impacts the decay of Danio rerio carcasses within a substrate. Our control experiments show that quartz sand sediment physically stabilises the carcass throughout decay and the sequence of anatomical character loss remains constant, however, both the onset and rate of decay of soft tissues are initially accelerated. Our XCT data show that exposure to X-rays does not cause a deviation from the normal sequence of decay, validating XCT as a non-destructive visualisation method for decay experiments. Furthermore, when accompanied with traditional exhumation and dissection, XCT provides decay data with higher accuracy of character analysis than traditional methods, and allows novel quantitative techniques to monitor physical changes in the decaying carcass (e.g., total volume, build-up of gases, collapse of the body cavity etc.). We also underline limitations with the technique, but our experiment acts as an important 'stepping stone' for progression toward non-invasive designs of decay experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have the potential to fully characterise the proline cis and trans sub-ensembles, they are limited by the slow timescales of isomerisation and force field inaccuracies. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can report on ensemble-averaged observables for both the cis and trans proline states, but a full atomistic characterisation of these sub-ensembles is challenging. Given the importance of proline cis/trans isomerisation for influencing the conformational sampling of disordered proteins, we employed a combination of all-atom MD simulations with enhanced sampling (metadynamics), NMR, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to characterise the two sub-ensembles of the ORF6 C-terminal region (ORF6CTR) from SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to the proline-57 (P57) cis and trans states. We performed MD simulations in three distinct force fields: AMBER03ws, AMBER99SB-disp, and CHARMM36m, which are all optimised for disordered proteins. Each simulation was run for an accumulated time of 180-220 s until convergence was reached, as assessed by blocking analysis. A good agreement between the cis-P57 populations predicted from metadynamics simulations in AMBER03ws was observed with populations obtained from experimental NMR data. Moreover, we observed good agreement between the radius of gyration predicted from the metadynamics simulations in AMBER03ws and that measured using SAXS. Our findings suggest that both the cis-P57 and trans-P57 conformations of ORF6CTR are extremely dynamic and that interdisciplinary approaches combining both multi-scale computations and experiments offer avenues to explore highly dynamic states that cannot be reliably characterised by either approach in isolation.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

This evolutionary radiation has been accompanied by substantial dietary shifts, often characterized by phenotypic modifications encompassing morphological, metabolic and behavioral changes. Hence, these endemic spiders represent an excellent model for understanding the evolutionary drivers and to pinpoint the genomic determinants underlying adaptive radiations. Recently, we achieved the first chromosome-level genome assembly of one of the endemic species, D. silvatica, providing a high-quality reference sequence for evolutionary genomics studies. Here, we conducted a low-coverage based resequencing study of a natural population of D. silvatica from La Gomera island. Taking advantage of the new high-quality genome, we characterized genome-wide levels of nucleotide polymorphism, divergence, and linkage disequilibrium, and inferred the demographic history of this population. We also performed comprehensive genome-wide scans for recent positive selection. Our findings uncovered exceptionally high levels of nucleotide diversity and recombination in this geographically restricted endemic species, indicative of large historical effective population sizes. Furthermore, we identified genomic regions potentially under positive selection, shedding light on relevant biological processes, such as vision and nitrogen extraction as possible targets of adaptation and eventually, as drivers of the species diversification. This pioneering study in spiders endemic of an oceanic archipelago lays the groundwork for broader population genomics investigations aimed at understanding the genetic mechanisms driven adaptive radiations in island ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

However, the process by which soluble cytoskeletal monomers maneuver through the cytoplasms ever-changing environment to reach their destinations without using these pathways remains unknown. 4-6 Here, we show that actin cytoskeletal treadmilling leads to the formation of a semi-permeable actin-myosin barrier, creating a specialized compartment separated from the rest of the cell body that directs proteins toward the cell edge by advection, diffusion facilitated by fluid flow. Contraction at this barrier generates a molecularly non-specific fluid flow that transports actin, actin-binding proteins, adhesion proteins, and even inert proteins forward. The local curvature of the barrier specifically targets these proteins toward protruding edges of the leading edge, sites of new filament growth, effectively coordinating protein distribution with cellular dynamics. Outside this compartment, diffusion remains the primary mode of protein transport, contrasting sharply with the directed advection within. This discovery reveals a novel protein transport mechanism that redefines the front of the cell as a pseudo-organelle, actively orchestrating protein mobilization for cellular front activities such as protrusion and adhesion. By elucidating a new model of protein dynamics at the cellular front, this work contributes a critical piece to the puzzle of how cells adapt their internal structures for targeted and rapid response to extracellular cues. The findings challenge the current understanding of intracellular transport, suggesting that cells possess highly specialized and previously unrecognized organizational strategies for managing protein distribution efficiently, providing a new framework for understanding the cellular architectures role in rapid response and adaptation to environmental changes.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599997

This neurodevelopmental trajectory is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. While common genetic variants account for a large proportion of inherited genetic risk, rare genetic variations, particularly copy number variants (CNVs), play a significant role in the genetic architecture of neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite their importance, the relevance of CNVs to child psychopathology and cognitive function in the general population remains underexplored. Objective: Investigating CNV associations with dimensions of child psychopathology and cognitive functions. Design, Setting, and Participants: ABCD study focuses on a cohort of over 11,875 youth aged 9 to 10, recruited from 21 sites in the US, aiming to investigate the role of various factors, including brain, environment, and genetic factors, in the etiology of mental and physical health from middle childhood through early adulthood. Data analysis occurred from April 2023 to April 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures: In this study, we utilized PennCNV and QuantiSNP algorithms to identify duplications and deletions larger than 50Kb across a cohort of 11,088 individuals from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. CNVs meeting quality control standards were subjected to a genome-wide association scan to identify regions associated with quantitative measures of broad psychiatric symptom domains and cognitive outcomes. Additionally, a CNV risk score, reflecting the aggregated burden of genetic intolerance to inactivation and dosage sensitivity, was calculated to assess its impact on variability in overall and dimensional child psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes. Results: In a final sample of 8,564 individuals (mean age=9.9 years, 4,532 males) passing quality control, we identified 4,111 individuals carrying 5,760 autosomal CNVs. Our results revealed significant associations between specific CNVs and our phenotypes of interest, psychopathology and cognitive function. For instance, a duplication at 10q26.3 was associated with overall psychopathology, and somatic complaints in particular. Additionally, deletions at 1q12.1, along with duplications at 14q11.2 and 10q26.3, were linked to overall cognitive function, with particular contributions from fluid intelligence (14q11.2), working memory (10q26.3), and reading ability (14q11.2). Moreover, individuals carrying CNVs previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders exhibited greater impairment in social functioning and cognitive performance across multiple domains, in particular working memory. Notably, a higher deletion CNV risk score was significantly correlated with increased overall psychopathology (especially in dimensions of social functioning, thought disorder, and attention) as well as cognitive impairment across various domains. Conclusions and Relevance: In summary, our findings shed light on the contributions of CNVs to interindividual variability in complex traits related to neurocognitive development and child psychopathology.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599997

These decisions are influenced not only by the availability and quality of food but also by the internal state of the animal, which needs to compute and give weights to these different variables before making a choice. Feeding preferences of female mosquitoes exemplify this behavioural plasticity. Both male and female mosquitoes usually feed on carbohydrate-rich sources of nectar or sap, but the female also feeds on blood, which is essential for egg development. This blood-appetite is modulated across the female's reproductive cycle, yet little is known about the factors that bring it about. We show that Anopheles stephensi females, a major vector for urban Malaria the Indian sub-continent and West-Africa, suppress blood-feeding between a blood-meal and until oviposition. Transcriptomics on blood-deprived and sated Anopheles stephensi mid-brains allowed us to shortlist several candidate genes that might promote blood-feeding behaviour. Through dsRNA-mediated knockdown of nine of them, we identified two neuropeptides - short Neuropeptide F (sNPF) and RYamide - that promote blood-feeding. We find that these neuromodulators are expressed in non-overlapping subsets of neurons in the brain suggesting that blood-feeding behaviour is likely modulated by multiple mechanisms acting across different brain neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma (MB), the most common embryonal brain tumor in children, and pineoblastoma. These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST. However, their mechanism of action remains unresolved. Here, we elucidate the mechanistic basis by which KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2, the direct neomorphic target of the substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we systematically map the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 propellers is stabilized by the MB mutations, which directly insert a bulky side chain into the active site pocket of HDAC1. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3-neo-substrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, our results unveil a converging shape complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4-HDAC1 interface, the aberrant degradation of CoREST, and the growth of KBTBD4-mutant MB models. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein-protein interactions and pharmacological strategies to modulate their action for therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

To address this, we developed a multiplexed in vivo CRISPR screening approach in chick embryos targeting genes expressed in the caudal epiblast and neural tube. This revealed a role for MLLT3, a component of the super elongation complex, in the specification of neural fate. Perturbation of MLLT3 disrupted neural tube morphology and reduced neural fate acquisition. Mutant forms of Retinoic Acid Receptor A lacking the MLLT3 binding domain similarly reduced neural fate acquisition.

To study transcript expression throughout Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis at single-molecule resolution, we developed a high-throughput single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) method that relies on computational methods to developmentally stage embryos and quantify individual mRNA molecules in single embryos. We applied our system to sdc-2, a zygotically transcribed gene essential for hermaphrodite development and dosage compensation. We found that sdc-2 is rapidly activated during early embryogenesis by increasing both the number of mRNAs produced per transcription site and the frequency of sites engaged in transcription. Knockdown of sdc-2 and dpy-27, a subunit of the dosage compensation complex (DCC), increased the number of active transcription sites for the X chromosomal gene dpy-23 but not the autosomal gene mdh-1, suggesting that the DCC reduces the frequency of dpy-23 transcription. The temporal resolution from in silico staging of embryos showed that the deletion of a single DCC recruitment element near the dpy-23 gene causes higher dpy-23 mRNA expression after the start of dosage compensation, which could not be resolved using mRNAseq from mixed-stage embryos. In summary, we have established a computational approach to quantify temporal regulation of transcription throughout C. elegans embryogenesis and demonstrated its potential to provide new insights into developmental gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

However, most cis regulatory elements (CREs) are highly divergent, which makes orthology tracing based on sequence similarity difficult, especially at larger evolutionary distances. Some evidence suggests functional conservation of CREs despite sequence divergence. However, it remains unclear how widespread such functional conservation might be.

Here, we address this question by profiling the regulatory genome in the embryonic hearts of chicken and mouse at equivalent developmental stages. Gene expression and 3D chromatin structure show remarkable similiarity, while the majority of CREs are non-alignable between the two species. To identify orthologous CREs independent of sequence alignability, we introduce a synteny-based strategy called Interspecies Point Projection (IPP). Compared to alignment-based approaches, IPP identifies up to 5-fold more putative orthologs in chicken, and up to 9-fold across distantly related vertebrates. We term these sequence-diverged orthologs indirectly conserved and characterize their functional conservation compared to sequence-alignable, directly conserved CREs. Indirectly and directly conserved elements show similar enrichment of functional chromatin signatures and cell-type specific enhancer sequence composition. Yet, shared transcription factor binding sites between orthologs are more heavily rearranged in indirectly conserved elements. Finally, we validate functional conservation of indirectly conserved chicken enhancers in mouse using in vivo reporter assays. Taken together, by overcoming the limitations of alignment-based methods our results reveal functional conservation of CREs across large evolutionary distances is more widespread than previously recognized.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

Moreover, even brief interictal spikes produced widespread alterations in cerebellar activity. Changes were noted in the anterior and posterior cerebellum, along the midline, and both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the seizure focus. Remarkably, changes in the cerebellum also occurred prior to any noticeable change in the hippocampal electrographic recordings, suggesting a special relationship between the cerebellum and hippocampal epileptiform activity.

To date, stroke patients have only few therapeutic options and are often left with considerable disabilities. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based therapies are emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for stroke recovery. In this study, we demonstrate that local transplantation of good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) improve long-term recovery-associated brain tissue responses and reduce neurological deficits after cerebral ischemia in mice. Using in vivo bioluminescence imaging and post-mortem histology, we showed long-term graft survival over the course of five weeks and preferential graft differentiation into mature neurons without signs of pluripotent residuals. Transplantation of NPCs led to a set of recovery-associated tissue responses including increased vascular sprouting and repair, improved blood-brain barrier integrity, reduced microglial activation, and increased neurogenesis compared to littermate control animals receiving sham transplantation. Employing deep learning-assisted behavior analysis, we found that NPC-treated mice displayed improved gait performance and complete fine-motor recovery in the horizontal ladder rung walk, five weeks post-injury. To dissect the molecular graft composition and identify graft-host interactions, single nucleus profiling of the cell transplants and host stroke tissue was performed. We identified graft differentiation preferentially towards GABAergic cells with remaining cells acquiring glutamatergic neuron, astrocyte, and NPC-like phenotypes. Interaction between graft and host transcriptome indicated that GABAergic cell grafts were primarily involved in graft-host communication through the regeneration-associated NRXN, NRG, NCAM and SLIT signalling pathways. In conclusion, our study reveals that transplanted iPSC-derived NPCs primarily differentiate into GABAergic neurons contributing to long-term recovery, and further delineates the regenerative interactions between the graft and the stroke-injured host tissue.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

Given the time frame and its location on a busy marine trade route, study of this burial site offers us a glimpse into the lives of the Late Antique population living on this island. It comprises 33 individuals, with 17 buried within a confined grave tomb, and the remaining individuals buried in separate locations in the tomb's proximity.

Analysis of the ancestral origins of the individuals buried at Hvar - Rado[s]evi[c] revealed a diverse population reflective of the era's genetic variability. The identification of genetic outliers suggests affiliations with distinct regions of the Roman Empire, possibly linked to trade routes associated with the Late Antique port in ancient Hvar. Stable isotope ratio analysis ({delta}13C and {delta}15N) indicated a diet mainly consisting of C3 plants, with minimal consumption of marine foods. High childhood mortality rates, physiological stress markers, and dental diseases suggest a low quality of life in the population.

Moreover, the accelerated melting of the Antarctic permafrost, the increasing exposure of soils, and the growing human transit pose the question of whether these environments could be a source of microbes or genes that could emerge and cause global health problems. In this line, although a high bacterial diversity and autochthonous multidrug-resistant bacteria have been found in soils of the Antarctic Peninsula, we still lack information regarding the resistome of areas closer to the South Pole. Moreover, no previous studies have evaluated the pathogenic potential of microbes inhabiting Antarctic soils. In this work, we combined metagenomic and culture-dependent approaches to investigate the microbial diversity, resistome, virulome, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in soils from Union Glacier, a high-latitude cold desert in West Antarctica. Despite the low organic matter content, diverse bacterial lineages were found, predominating Actinomycetota and Pseudomonadota, with limited archaeal and fungal taxa. We recovered more than 80 species-level representative genomes (SRGs) of predominant bacterial taxa and the archaeon Nitrosocosmicus sp. Diverse putative resistance and virulence genes were predicted among the SRGs, metagenomic reads, and contigs. Furthermore, we characterized bacterial isolates resistant to up to 24 clinical antibiotics, mainly Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Plantibacter, and Flavobacterium. Moreover, some isolates produced putative virulence factors, including siderophores, pyocyanins, and exoenzymes with hemolytic, lecithinase, protease, and DNAse activity.

This augmented insight into genomic drivers enhances our understanding of cancer progression and metastasis, holding the potential to significantly foster biomarker discovery.

Statement of significanceBy leveraging large datasets and new computational modelling, this study demonstrates the critical interplay between somatic mutations and copy number alterations in driving patient prognosis, tumour progression and metastatic tropism. This work implies a shift towards a more integrative and comprehensive approach in clinical sequencing, with significant implications for biomarker discovery and target identification.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599998

We show that Rab7 deficiency produces late endosomes and lysosomes with acidic pH, lysosome-specific proteins and membrane architectures that are functional in protein degradation and organelle fusion. Furthermore, Rab7-deficient lysosomes form from Rab4- and transferrin receptor-positive recycling endosomes, resulting in the degradation of proteins designated for recycling. Finally, we also found that overexpression of Rab4 can direct lysosome formation from recycling endosomes in absence as well as presence of Rab7, however, the latter to a much lesser extent. Our findings reveal a lysosome biogenesis and lysosomal protein degradation pathway that becomes dominant in absence of Rab7 or when Rab4 is highly abundant.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

This modification plays a pivotal role in the regulation of diverse biological processes, including epigenetics, transcriptional control, and cellular signaling. Although less studied in prokaryotes, recent research has begun to reveal the potential role of methylation in modulating bacterial immune evasion and adherence to host cells. In this study, we analyzed the cell surface proteins of the toluene-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 by label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and found that the lysine residues of its trimeric autotransporter adhesin (TAA), AtaA, are methylated. Over 130 lysine residues of AtaA, consisting of 3,630 amino acids and containing 232 lysine residues, were methylated. We identified the outer membrane protein lysine methyltransferase (OM PKMT) of Tol 5, KmtA, which specifically methylates the lysine residues of AtaA. In the KmtA-deficient mutant, most lysine methylations on AtaA were absent, indicating that KmtA is responsible for the methylation of multiple lysine residues throughout AtaA. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the OM PKMT genes were widely distributed among gram-negative bacteria, including pathogens with TAAs that promote infectivity, such as Burkholderia mallei and Haemophilus influenzae. Although KmtA has sequence similarities to the OM PKMTs of Rickettsia involved in infectivity, KmtA-like PKMTs formed a distinct cluster from those of the Rickettsia type according to the clustering analysis, suggesting that they are new types of PKMTs. Furthermore, the deletion of Tol 5 KmtA led to an increase in AtaA on the cell surface and enhanced bacterial adhesion, resulting in slower growth.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

We examined language lateralization using functional magnetic resonance imaging with two large pediatric cohorts (total n=273 children ages 4-16; n=107 adults). Strong, adult-level left-hemispheric lateralization (in activation volume and response magnitude) was evident by age 4.

Traditionally, ER moves by either sliding along stable microtubules via molecular motors or attaching to the plus ends of dynamic microtubules through tip attachment complexes (TAC). A recently discovered third process, hitchhiking, involves motile vesicles pulling ER tubules along microtubules. Previous research showed that ER hitchhikes on Rab5- and Rab7-marked endosomes, but it is uncertain if other Rab-vesicles can do the same. In U2OS cells, we screened Rabs for their ability to cotransport with ER tubules and found that ER hitchhikes on post-Golgi vesicles marked by Rab6 (isoforms a and b). Rab6-ER hitchhiking occurs independently of ER-endolysosome contacts and TAC-mediated ER movement. Disrupting either Rab6 or the motility of Rab6-vesicles reduces overall ER movement. Conversely, relocating these vesicles to the cell periphery causes peripheral ER accumulation, indicating that Rab6-vesicle motility is crucial for a subset of ER movements. Proximal post-Golgi vesicles marked by TGN46 are involved in Rab6-ER hitchhiking, while other post-Golgi vesicles (Rabs 8/10/11/13/14) are not essential for ER movement. Our further analysis finds that ER to Golgi vesicles marked by Rab1 are also capable of driving a subset of ER movements. Taken together, our findings suggest that ER hitchhiking on Rab-vesicles is a significant mode of ER movement.

Using simple tasks requiring rapid evaluation of a stationary sensory feature, two human neurophysiological signals have been found to evolve with similar integration dynamics, with one (centroparietal positivity; CPP) appearing to compute the running integral and continuously feed it to the other (motor beta lateralisation; MBL). However, it remains unknown whether and how these signals serve more distinct functional roles in more complex scenarios where information arrives discontinuously and requires more computational steps to form appropriate belief updates. We employed a volatile expanded judgement task that permits dissociation of the encoding of raw sensory information in each of a series of discrete stimuli ('objective evidence'), the appropriately transformed belief updates from that information ('effective evidence'), and the evolving belief itself (accumulated evidence). Whereas MBL traced the evolving belief across stimuli, the CPP was found only to locally encode the effective evidence associated with each individual stimulus. Furthermore, fluctuations in CPP amplitude after each single stimulus could account for variability in the encoding of accumulated evidence in MBL. These results suggest a flexible computational hierarchy in which effective evidence can be computed sample-by-sample at an intermediate processing level to drive downstream belief updates for protracted decisions about discrete stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

In the last decade, however, small ribozymes have also been detected across the tree of life, from bacterial to human genomes, and more recently, in viral agents with circRNA genomes. Here we report the conserved occurrence of small ribozymes within the linear genomes of typical ds and ssRNA viruses from fungi and plants. In most 5'-UTR regions of chrysovirids and fusarivirids, we find conserved type I hammerhead ribozymes (hhrbzs) showing efficient self-cleaving activity in vitro and in vivo. Similar hhrbzs, as well as hepatitis delta and twister ribozymes, were also detected in megabirna-, hypo-, fusagra- and toti-like viruses. These ribozymes occur as isolated motifs but also as close tandem pairs, suggesting that they are involved in the formation of ~300 nt circRNAs. In vivo characterization of a chrysovirid hhrbz revealed its unexpected role in protein translation as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). RNA structural comparison between the hammerhead three-way junction and the core domain of picornavirus IRES elements allow us to suggest that these simple ribozymes may follow a similar strategy to achieve cap-independent translation. We conclude that self-cleaving ribozymes, historically involved in the rolling circle replication of viroid-like agents, have been exapted towards translational functions in linear RNA viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

They have been shown to be present in a wide variety of enzymes across all functional and structural classes. However, the study of such pathways is experimentally challenging because they are typically transient. Computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been successfully proposed to explore tunnels. Conventional MD (cMD) provides structural details to characterize tunnels but suffers from sampling limitations to capture rare tunnel openings on longer timescales. Therefore, in this study, we explored the potential of Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) simulations to improve the exploration of complex tunnel networks in enzymes. We used the haloalkane dehalogenase LinB and its two variants with engineered transport pathways, which are not only well-known for their application potential but have also been extensively studied experimentally and computationally regarding their tunnel networks and their importance in multi-step catalytic reactions. Our study demonstrates that GaMD efficiently improves tunnel sampling and allows the identification of all known tunnels for LinB and its two mutants. Furthermore, the improved sampling provided insight into a previously unknown transient side tunnel (ST). The extensive conformational landscape explored by GaMD simulations allowed us to investigate in detail the mechanism of ST opening. We determined variant-specific dynamic properties of ST opening, which were previously inaccessible due to limited sampling of cMD. Our comprehensive analysis supports multiple indicators of the functional relevance of the ST, emphasizing its potential significance beyond structural considerations. In conclusion, our research proves that the GaMD method can overcome the sampling limitations of cMD for the effective study of tunnels in enzymes, providing further means for identifying rare tunnels in enzymes with potential for drug development, precision medicine, and rational protein engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

Spatial-omics technologies can simultaneously measure information from three complementary domains related to this task: expression levels of a panel of molecular biomarkers at single-cell resolution, relative positions of cells, and images of tissue sections, but existing computational methods for performing this task on single-cell spatial-omics datasets often relinquish information from one or more domains. The additional reliance on the availability of ""atlas"" training or reference datasets limits cell type discovery to well-defined but limited cell population labels, thus posing major challenges for using these methods in practice. Successful integration of all three domains presents an opportunity for uncovering cell populations that are functionally stratified by their spatial contexts at cellular and tissue levels: the key motivation for employing spatial-omics technologies in the first place.

In this work, we introduce Cell Spatio- and Neighborhood-informed Annotation and Patterning (CellSNAP), a self-supervised computational method that learns a representation vector for each cell in tissue samples measured by spatial-omics technologies at the single-cell or finer resolution. The learned representation vector fuses information about the corresponding cell across all three aforementioned domains. By applying CellSNAP to datasets spanning both spatial proteomic and spatial transcriptomic modalities, and across different tissue types and disease settings, we show that CellSNAP markedly enhances de novo discovery of biologically relevant cell populations at fine granularity, beyond current approaches, by fully integrating cells molecular profiles with cellular neighborhood and tissue image information.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

There is limited literature exploring the accessibility of CAMHS for autistic young people, particularly from parents perspectives. The present study aimed to 1) explore the experiences of parents/carers seeking help from CAMHS for their autistic childs mental health difficulties, and 2) gain parents perceptions of the accessibility of CAMHS support for their child and understand what could be improved.

MethodsA mixed-methods survey design was used to learn from parents/carers. 300 parents/carers took part from across the UK between June and October 2023. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data using qualitative content analysis.

ResultsFindings demonstrated the ongoing struggles that parents/carers faced when seeking professional help from CAMHS for their child. Many were not referred to CAMHS or were rejected without an assessment, often due to issues relating to diagnostic overshadowing, a high threshold for assessment, or a lack of professional knowledge about autism and care pathways. Those who were referred reported a lack of reasonable adjustments and offers of ineffective or inappropriate therapies, leaving young people unable to engage, and thus not benefiting. Ultimately, parents felt their childs mental health difficulties either did not improve or declined to the point of crisis. However, there was a recognition that some professionals were kind and compassionate, and provided the validation that parents needed.

ConclusionsThere is a need for a more neuro-inclusive and personalised approach in CAMHS, from the professionals themselves, in the adjustments that are offered, and in the therapies that are provided. Further research, funding, and training are urgently needed to ensure mental health support is accessible, timely, and effective for autistic CYP.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599998

While polymorphisms hypothesized to be under balancing selection segregate within many species, it remains rare for the genetic basis and the selective forces to both be known for the same trait, leading to an incomplete understanding of many classes of polymorphisms. Here, we uncover the genetic architecture of a balanced sexual mimicry polymorphism and identify behavioral mechanisms that may be involved in its maintenance in the swordtail fish Xiphophorus birchmanni. We find that [~]40% of X. birchmanni males develop a ""false gravid spot"", a melanic pigmentation pattern that mimics the ""pregnancy spot"" associated with sexual maturity in female live-bearing fish. Using genome-wide association mapping, we detect a single intergenic region associated with variation in the false gravid spot, which is upstream of kitlga, a gene involved in melanophore patterning. By performing long-read sequencing within and across populations, we identify complex structural rearrangements between alternate alleles at this locus. The false gravid spot haplotype drives increased allele-specific expression of kitlga, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the increased melanophore abundance that causes the spot. By studying social interactions in the laboratory and in nature, we find that males with the false gravid spot experience less aggression; however, they also receive increased attention from other males and are disdained by females. These behavioral interactions may play a role in maintaining this phenotypic polymorphism in natural populations. We speculate that structural variants affecting gene regulation may be an underappreciated driver of balanced polymorphisms across diverse species.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

However, these viability-coupled strategies are not quantitative and are limited by toxicity of the RuBisCO substrate RuBP, the slow kinetics of RuBisCO, and differences in RuBisCO expression. We report the development of the first genetically encoded system capable of accurately quantifying RuBisCO-dependent CO2 fixation in cellulo using a tripartite approach that combines bacterial strains which insulate RuBisCO-derived products, an engineered pathway that eliminates RuBP toxicity, and biosensors to concurrently monitor RuBisCO abundance and catalysis. We extended this biosensing strategy to 43 Form II and II/III RuBisCO homologs, finding strong agreement with in vitro-derived enzyme kinetics in living cells for the first time. Finally, we show how this system can be used to rapidly evolve functional RuBisCO enzymes. Our approach overcomes prior limitations by streamlining intracellular RuBisCO analyses and will enable the development of enzymes with improved CO2 fixation capabilities.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

Yet, their implication for disease pathogenesis remains largely limited. Here, we introduce scPRS, a geometric deep learning model that constructs single-cell-resolved PRS leveraging reference single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling data to enhance biological discovery as well as disease prediction. Real-world applications across multiple complex diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and Alzheimers disease (AD), showcase the superior prediction power of scPRS compared to traditional PRS methods. Importantly, scPRS not only predicts disease risk but also uncovers disease-relevant cells, such as hormone-high alpha and beta cells for T2D, cardiomyocytes and pericytes for HCM, and astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells for AD. Facilitated by a layered multi-omic analysis, scPRS further identifies cell-type-specific genetic underpinnings, linking disease-associated genetic variants to gene regulation within corresponding cell types. We substantiate the disease relevance of scPRS-prioritized HCM genes and demonstrate that the suppression of these genes in HCM cardiomyocytes is rescued by Mavacamten treatment. Additionally, we establish a novel microglia-specific regulatory relationship between the AD risk variant rs7922621 and its target genes ANXA11 and TSPAN14. We further illustrate the detrimental effects of suppressing these two genes on microglia phagocytosis. Our work provides a multi-tasking, interpretable framework for precise disease prediction and systematic investigation of the genetic, cellular, and molecular basis of complex diseases, laying the methodological foundation for single-cell genetics.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

Notwithstanding this general trend of chromosome-scale conservation, ALGs have been obliterated by extensive genome rearrangements in certain groups, most notably including Clitellata (oligochaetes and leeches), a group of easily overlooked invertebrates that is of tremendous ecological, agricultural and economic importance (Charles 2019; Barrett 2016). To further investigate these rearrangements, we have undertaken a comparison of 12 clitellate genomes (including four newly sequenced species) and 11 outgroup representatives. We show that these rearrangements began at the base of the Clitellata (rather than progressing gradually throughout polychaete annelids), that the inter-chromosomal rearrangements continue in several clitellate lineages and that these events have substantially shaped the evolution of the otherwise highly conserved Hox cluster.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

The frontal cortex is an important hub for integration and control of information, and its integrity and connectivity within the wider neural system are linked to individual differences across multiple cognitive domains and neurodevelopmental conditions. Here we leveraged fetal brain transcriptomics to investigate molecular mechanisms during prenatal development that drive early differences between the two regions at the opposite poles of the physical and representational gradient of the brain - the frontal and visual cortex. We show that the frontal cortex exhibits significantly higher cumulative gene expression for pathways involved in the continued growth and maintenance of larger neurons. These pathways include the gene ontology terms of neuron development and neuronal cell body as well as glucose metabolism important in trophically supporting larger cell sizes. Whole pathways for axonal growth (axonal growth cone, microtubules, filopodia, lamellipodia) and single genes involved in circuit connectivity exhibited increased expression in the frontal cortex. In contrast, in line with the established earlier completion of neurogenesis and lower number of neurons in the anterior cortex, expression of genes involved in DNA replication was significantly lower relative to the visual cortex. We further demonstrate differential cellular composition with higher expression of marker genes for inhibitory neurons in the prenatal frontal cortex. Together, these results suggest that the cellular architecture and composition facilitates earlier connectivity in the frontal cortex which may determine its role as an integrative hub in the global brain organization.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

Species-level resolution is limited in these studies, as each variable region enables the characterisation of a different subsection of the microbiome. Although long-read sequencing techniques take advantage of all 9 variable regions by sequencing the entire 16S rRNA gene, they are substantially more expensive. This work assessed the feasibility of accurate species-level resolution and reproducibility using a relatively new sequencing kit and bioinformatics pipeline developed for short-read sequencing of multiple variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, we evaluated the potential impact of different sample collection methods on our outcomes.

MethodsUsing xGenTM 16S Amplicon Panel v2 kits, sequencing of all 9 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Mock cells and mock DNA for 8 bacterial species were included as extraction and sequencing controls respectively. Within-run and between-run replicate samples, and pairs of stool and rectal swabs collected at 0-5 weeks from the same participants, were incorporated. Observed relative abundances of each species were compared to theoretical abundances provided by ZymoBIOMICS. Paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests and distance-based intraclass correlation coefficients were used to statistically compare alpha and beta diversity measures, respectively, for pairs of replicates and stool/rectal swab sample pairs.

ResultsUsing multiple variable regions of the 16S ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid (rRNA) gene, we found that we could accurately identify taxa to a species level and obtain highly reproducible results at a species level. Yet, the microbial profiles of stool and rectal swab sample pairs differed substantially despite being collected concurrently from the same infants.

ConclusionThis protocol provides an effective means for studying infant gut microbial samples at a species level. However, sample collection approaches need to be accounted for in any downstream analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1.

In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599998

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599998

Inspired by the eukaryotic ubiquitination cascade, we developed an ATP-driven platform for C-terminal activation and peptide ligation based on E. coli MccB, a bacterial ancestor of ubiquitin-activating (E1) enzymes that natively catalyzes C-terminal phosphoramidate bond formation. We show that MccB can act on non-native substrates to generate an O-AMPylated electrophile that can react with exogenous nucleophiles to form diverse C-terminal functional groups including thioesters, a versatile class of biological intermediates that have been exploited for protein semisynthesis. To direct this activity towards specific proteins of interest, we developed the Thioesterification C-terminal Handle (TeCH)-tag, a sequence that enables high-yield, ATP-driven protein bioconjugation via a thioester intermediate. By mining the natural diversity of the MccB family, we developed two additional MccB/TeCH-tag pairs that are mutually orthogonal to each other and to the E. coli system, facilitating the synthesis of more complex bioconjugates. Our method mimics the chemical logic of peptide bond synthesis that is widespread in biology for high-yield in vitro manipulation of protein structure with molecular precision.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

ObjectiveTo evaluate febrile seizure risk following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among children aged 2-5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe primary analysis evaluated children who had a febrile seizure outcome in the 0-1 days following COVID-19 vaccination. A self-controlled case series analysis was performed in three commercial insurance databases to compare the risk of seizure in the risk interval (0-1 days) to a control interval (8-63 days).

ExposureReceipt of dose 1 and/or dose 2 of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was febrile seizure (0-1 day risk interval).

AnalysisA conditional Poisson regression model was used to compare outcome rates in risk and control intervals and estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analyses were used to pool results across databases.

ResultsThe primary meta-analysis found a statistically significant increased incidence of febrile seizure, in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 vaccination compared to the control interval (IRR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.35 to 4.69, risk difference (RD)/100,000 doses = 3.22 (95%CI -0.31 to 6.75)). For the BNT162b2 vaccination, the IRR was elevated but not statistically significant (IRR: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.48 to 4.11, RD/100,000 doses = -0.25 (95%CI -2.75 to 2.24).

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong children aged 2-5 years, the analysis showed a small elevated incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures in the 0-1 days following the mRNA-1273 vaccination. Based on the current body of scientific evidence, the safety profile of the monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAmong children aged 2-5 years, is the risk of febrile seizure elevated immediately following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared with a later period after vaccination?

FindingsIn this self-controlled case series that included participants aged 2-5 years from three commercial insurance databases, the incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures was significantly elevated in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 administration. Absolute risk was small.

MeaningThe incidence of febrile seizures was elevated immediately following vaccination with the monovalent mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 2-5 years. Based on the current body of evidence, the safety profile of monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599999

Variant effect predictors (VEPs) play a vital role in deciphering this complex relationship, yet evaluating their performance remains challenging due to data circularity, where the same or related data is used for training and assessment. High-throughput experimental strategies like deep mutational scanning (DMS) offer a promising solution. In this study, we extend upon our previous benchmarking approach, assessing the performance of 84 different VEPs and DMS experiments from 36 different human proteins. In addition, a new pairwise, VEP-centric ranking method reduces the impact of VEP score availability on the overall ranking. We observe a remarkably high correspondence between VEP performance in DMS-based benchmarks and clinical variant classification, especially for predictors that have not been directly trained on human clinical variants. Our results suggest that comparing VEP performance against diverse functional assays represents a reliable strategy for assessing their relative performance in clinical variant classification. However, major challenges in clinical interpretation of VEP scores persist, highlighting the need for further research to fully leverage computational predictors for genetic diagnosis. We also address practical considerations for end users in terms of choice of methodology.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

Whether and how the negative impact of inflammation is monitored remains largely unknown. Acidification of the tissue microenvironment is associated with inflammation. Here we investigated whether macrophages sense tissue acidification to adjust inflammatory responses. We found that acidic pH restructured the inflammatory response of macrophages in a gene-specific manner. We identified mammalian BRD4 as a novel intracellular pH sensor. Acidic pH disrupts the transcription condensates containing BRD4 and MED1, via histidine-enriched intrinsically disordered regions. Crucially, decrease in macrophage intracellular pH is necessary and sufficient to regulate transcriptional condensates in vitro and in vivo, acting as negative feedback to regulate the inflammatory response. Collectively, these findings uncovered a pH-dependent switch in transcriptional condensates that enables environmental sensing to directly control inflammation, with a broader implication for calibrating the magnitude and quality of inflammation by the inflammatory cost.

Here, we explored a large number of publicly available human microbiome datasets and retrieved a total of 829 anellovirus genomes, substantially expanding the known diversity of these viruses. The majority of new genomes fall within the three major human anellovirus genera: Alphatorquevirus, Betatorquevirus and Gammatorquevirus, while we also present one new genome of the under-sampled Hetorquevirus genus. The phylogeny reconstructed from the conserved ORF1 gene reveals three additional, previously undescribed, human anellovirus clades. We performed recombination analysis and show evidence of extensive recombination across all human anelloviruses. Interestingly, more than 95% of the detected events are between members of the same clade and only 15 inter-clade recombination events were detected. The breakpoints of recombination cluster in hotspots at the ends and outside of the ORF1 gene, while a recombination coldspot was detected within the gene. Our analysis suggests that anellovirus evolution is governed by homologous recombination, however events between distant viruses or ones producing chimaeric ORF1s likely lead to non-viable recombinants. The large number of genomes further allowed us to examine how essential genomic features vary across anelloviruses. These include functional domains in the ORF1 protein and the nucleotide motif of the replication loop region, required for the viruses' rolling-circle replication. A subset of the genomes assembled in both this and previous studies are completely lacking these essential elements, opening up the possibility that anellovirus intracellular populations contain defective virus genomes (DVGs). Overall, our study highlights key features of anellovirus genomics and evolution, a largely understudied group of viruses whose potential in virus-based therapeutics is recently being explored.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

However, the remainder of the SDR does not show patterns typically found in non-recombining SDRs, like repeat accumulation and gene loss. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dioecy is recently derived in Amborella and the sex chromosome pair has not significantly degenerated.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

Six-week-old mice lacking either Pnma1 or Pnma4 are indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, but by six months the mutant mice become prematurely subfertile, with precipitous drops in sex hormone levels, gonadal atrophy, and abdominal obesity; overall they produce markedly fewer offspring than controls.

Here we identify molecular players orchestrating this metabolic balance, and uncover a signaling molecule that mediates energy homeostasis during fat depletion. We show tissue-specific depletion of fatty acyl-CoA synthase FASN1 in the Drosophila fat body (FB) causes near complete fat loss and metabolic remodeling that dramatically elevates carbohydrate metabolism, leading to a striking [~]20-fold increase in glycogen storage. Proteomics and metabolomics identify key factors necessary for rewiring including glycolysis enzymes and target-of-brain-insulin (tobi). FASN1-deficient flies are viable but starvation sensitive, oxidatively stressed, and infertile. We also identify CG10824/cDIP as upregulated in FASN1-depleted Drosophila. cDIP is a leucine-rich-repeat protein with homology to secreted adipokines that fine-tune energy signaling. We find FB-specific cDIP loss promotes Drosophila adult obesity, and is required for development in the absence of FASN1-dependent lipid storage. Collectively, we show fat-depleted Drosophila rewire their metabolism to complete development, and identify cDIP as a putative new cytokine that signals fat insufficiency and may regulate energy homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

However, most existing externally triggered delivery systems are based on complex micromachines that are controlled with electromagnetic waves and require custom external instrumentation. Here we present a drug delivery platform comprising a simple protein-containing hydrogel that can be both imaged and triggered to release drugs at specific locations using widely available ultrasound imaging devices. This technology is based on the addition of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles (GVs) to hydrogel delivery vehicles. While intact, GVs sterically block the release of drug payloads and allow the vehicle to be imaged with ultrasound. An increase in ultrasound pressure causes the collapse of GVs within hydrogels present at the desired anatomical location, instantly creating percolation channels and triggering rapid drug release. Both the imaging and release are performed using a common diagnostic ultrasound probe. We implement this concept by establishing ultrasound-controlled drug diffusion and release from hydrogels in vitro and demonstrating targeted image-guided protein delivery in vivo following oral administration. We use this approach to deliver anti-inflammatory antibodies to treat gastrointestinal inflammation in a rat model of colitis. Targeted acoustic percolation switches (TAPS) open a conduit for local, image-guided drug delivery with a simple formulation and commonplace ultrasound equipment.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

Dorsetichthys bechei is an Early Jurassic stem teleost of historic importance. Although D. bechei is well described, its proximity to the teleost crown and relationships with other stem teleosts is challenging due to previous associations with the wastebasket assemblage known as ""pholidophorids"". Here we present a new, three-dimensionally preserved specimen of Dorsetichthys bechei from the Blue Lias Formation (Sinemurian) Lyme Regis, UK. High-resolution CT scanning of this specimen plus additional material reveals previously unknown internal morphological information, including of the jaw and palate, hyoid arch, and gill skeleton. Importantly, this previously undescribed articulated specimen permits description of the external dermal skeleton and internal endoskeleton for the same individual, clarifying past accounts drawing on composite descriptions of two- and three-dimensionally preserved specimens. We confirm the presence of important teleost synapomorphies such as a mobile premaxilla and quadratojugal process. However, contrasting previous accounts, we find no evidence for dorsal and ventral hypohyals or a postarticular process of the lower jaw. We also confirm the presence of a prearticular. The presence of a mobile upper jaw, elaborate gill rakers and reduced dentition also support a possible facultative filter feeding ecology. These new anatomical data support removal of D. bechei from Pholidophoridae and Pholidophoriformes as currently defined but indicate that finer-scale patterns of relationships among more crownward members of the teleost stem are some way from being resolved.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

But the exact role of pupil size in visual perception is still poorly understood. We recorded pupil size and electrical activity from the retina and brain while healthy human participants viewed full-screen flashes. We found that early retinal responses, which peaked around 25 ms after stimulus onset and predicted subsequent activity over visual cortex, were strongly affected by stimulus intensity. Importantly, pupil size, at least within the range of naturally occurring fluctuations, did not affect the amplitude of these early retinal responses, despite resulting in substantial changes in retinal light exposure. However, the direction of pupil-size change at the moment of stimulus presentation did modulate the amplitude of early retinal responses, which were enhanced during phases of dilation as compared to constriction. Based on these results, we suggest that fast-acting adaptation processes may normalize early retinal responses with respect to changes in retinal light exposure that result from spontaneous changes in pupil size: an initial form of brightness constancy. These results shed new light on, and raise important and previously unasked questions about, the role of pupil size in visual perception.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

As a first effort, we studied the antiviral potency of combinations of antivirals. To that end, we made use of primary human airway epithelial cell (HAEC) cultures grown at the air-liquid interface that were infected with the beta coronavirus OC43.

To study this, we combined a genetically engineered mouse model of mammary carcinoma with syngeneic transplantation and primary tumour resection to generate isogenic cells from primary tumours and their corresponding lung micrometastases. Metabolic analyses indicated that micrometastatic cells increase proline production at the expense of glutathione synthesis leading to a reduction in total glutathione levels. Micrometastatic cells also have altered sphingomyelin metabolism leading to increased intracellular levels of specific ceramides. The combination of these two metabolic adaptations alters small extracellular vesicle (sEV) production to drive generation of an invasive microenvironment. Indeed, micrometastatic cells shut-down Rab27-dependent production of sEVs and, instead, switch-on neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSM2)-dependent sEV release. sEVs released in a nSM2-dependent manner from micrometastatic cells, in turn, influence the ability of fibroblasts to deposit extracellular matrix which promotes cancer cell invasiveness. These data provide evidence that metabolic rewiring drives invasive processes in metastasis by influencing sEV release.

SummaryBreast cancer cells isolated from lung micrometastases have altered metabolism which influences extracellular vesicle production to generate invasive microenvironments.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

As a subunit intranasal COVID-19 vaccine reduced nasopharyngeal virus more than did an intramuscular (IM) vaccine, we hypothesized that this vaccine might reduce onward transmission to others. We vaccinated hamsters with either the IM-administrated Moderna mRNA vaccine twice or one dose of mRNA IM followed by adjuvanted subunit intranasal vaccine. 24 hours after SARS-CoV-2 challenge, these animals were housed with naive recipients in a contactless chamber that allows airborne transmission. Onward airborne transmission was profoundly blocked: the donor and recipients of the intranasal vaccine-boosted group had lower oral and lung viral loads (VL), which correlated with mucosal ACE2 inhibition activity. These data strongly support the use of the intranasal vaccine as a boost to protect not only the vaccinated person, but also people exposed to the vaccinated person, a key public health goal.

Author summaryNatural transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily airborne, through the respiratory mucosal route. However, current licensed COVID-19 vaccines are all intramuscular and induce more systemic than mucosal immunity. Here, we did a head-to-head comparison of COVID-19 booster vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 onward transmission. We found that compared to boosting with a Moderna mRNA systemic vaccine, a nanoparticle intranasal COVID-19 vaccine much more effectively prevents onward airborne transmission to naive recipient hamsters. The protection was correlated with local mucosal antibody. Thus, a mucosal nanoparticle vaccine should be considered for preventing onward airborne transmission, a key public health necessity that has not been adequately studied.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

Despite decades of effort its structure and function remained elusive. Here, we determined the MicroED structure of full-length human MP20 in lipidic-cubic phase to a resolution of 3.5 [A]. MP20 forms tetramers each of which contain 4 transmembrane -helices that are packed against one another forming a helical bundle. Both the N- and C-termini of MP20 are cytoplasmic. We found that each MP20 tetramer formed adhesive interactions with an opposing tetramer in a head-to-head fashion. These interactions were mediated by the extracellular loops of the protein. The dimensions of the MP20 adhesive junctions are consistent with the 11 nm thin lens junctions. Investigation of MP20 localization in human lenses indicated that in young fiber cells MP20 was stored intracellularly in vesicles and upon fiber cell maturation MP20 inserted into the plasma membrane and restricted the extracellular space. Together these results suggest that MP20 forms lens thin junctions in vivo confirming its role as a structural protein in the human eye lens, essential for its optical transparency.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

However, it remained unclear how organoid transplantation into the colon affects epithelial phenotypes, which is key to assessing the model's suitability to study human epithelial cells. We employed Deep Visual Proteomics, integrating AI-guided cell classification, laser microdissection, and an improved proteomics pipeline to study the human colon. This created an in-depth cell type-resolved proteomics resource of human intestinal epithelial cells within human tissue, in vitro organoids, and the murine colon post-xenotransplantation.

The prokaryotic Argonaute protein DdmE uses a DNA guide to target plasmid DNA. A structure of the DdmDE complex, validated by in vivo mutational studies, shows that DNA binding by DdmE triggers disassembly of the DdmD dimer and loading of monomeric DdmD onto the non-target DNA strand.

Aquaporin-4 assembles in astrocyte plasma membranes as symmetric tetramers or as arrays of tetramers. We report molecular structures of aquaporin-4 alone and bound to Fab fragments from patient-derived NMO autoantibodies using cryogenic electron microscopy. Each antibody binds to epitopes comprised of three extracellular loops of aquaporin-4 with contributions from multiple molecules in the assembly. The structures distinguish between antibodies that bind to the tetrameric form of aquaporin-4, and those targeting higher order orthogonal arrays of tetramers that provide more diverse bridging epitopes.

Consistent with behavior, missing inferred stimulus features were represented at prototypical values in neocortex. This cortical completion effect correlated with hippocampal responses, which in turn reflected the distance between imagined prototypes and experienced exemplars. This was paralleled by a learning-dependent grid-like representation of the underlying concept space in entorhinal cortex.

In mature root regions, endodermal cells coat their cell surface in a hydrophobic polymer termed suberin, which blocks solute transport across the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, specific cells adjacent to the water-conducting xylem remain unsuberized. These are termed ""passage cells"" based on the assumption that they create a ""passage"" for nutrient influx into vasculature in the otherwise sealed-off root regions. The identity and function of passage cells remain unknown, but their presence proposes the existence of individual identities within the endodermis. In this study, we probe this by performing an in-depth investigation of passage cells and endodermal suberization in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our work identifies the transcription factor MYB68 as a key regulator of suberization and endodermal lineage-specification related to passage cell formation. Through transcriptional profiling of myb68 mutants, we unravel genes with passage cell-associated expression that suggest a function in cation homeostasis. Collectively, our findings create a framework for a deeper understanding of radial cell identities within the endodermis and highlight that dynamic spatiotemporal patterning is an important physiological feature of root ground tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

This contradicts the influential ""vocal learning hypothesis"" that musical beat synchronization is only possible in species with complex vocalizations such as humans and some songbirds.

To estimate the eco-evolutionary forces shaping tails, we conducted phylogenetically-informed linear regressions. We built a well-sampled, time-calibrated phylogeny of the entirely tailed moth group (Actias + Argema) and performed ancestral state reconstruction and biogeographical analyses. To generate metrics of evolutionary pressures, we developed estimates of bat predator abundance and estimated environmental conditions associated with individual moth wing measurements. This integrative approach reveals evidence for positive selection on hindwing tails and body size by bats and negative selective pressure from environmental factors.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway.

To localize the ancestral and geographical origins of the Yamnaya among the diverse Eneolithic people that preceded them, we studied ancient DNA data from 428 individuals of which 299 are reported for the first time, demonstrating three previously unknown Eneolithic genetic clines. First, a ""Caucasus-Lower Volga"" (CLV) Cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer (CHG) ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end in Neolithic Armenia, and a steppe northern end in Berezhnovka in the Lower Volga. Bidirectional gene flow across the CLV cline created admixed intermediate populations in both the north Caucasus, such as the Maikop people, and on the steppe, such as those at the site of Remontnoye north of the Manych depression. CLV people also helped form two major riverine clines by admixing with distinct groups of European hunter-gatherers. A ""Volga Cline"" was formed as Lower Volga people mixed with upriver populations that had more Eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, creating genetically hyper-variable populations as at Khvalynsk in the Middle Volga. A ""Dnipro Cline"" was formed as CLV people bearing both Caucasus Neolithic and Lower Volga ancestry moved west and acquired Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer (UNHG) ancestry to establish the population of the Serednii Stih culture from which the direct ancestors of the Yamnaya themselves were formed around 4000BCE. This population grew rapidly after 3750-3350BCE, precipitating the expansion of people of the Yamnaya culture who totally displaced previous groups on the Volga and further east, while admixing with more sedentary groups in the west. CLV cline people with Lower Volga ancestry contributed four fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya, but also, entering Anatolia from the east, contributed at least a tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age Central Anatolians, where the Hittite language, related to the Indo-European languages spread by the Yamnaya, was spoken. We thus propose that the final unity of the speakers of the ""Proto-Indo-Anatolian"" ancestral language of both Anatolian and Indo-European languages can be traced to CLV cline people sometime between 4400-4000 BCE.

Genetic reconstruction of the ancestry of Pontic-Caspian steppe and West Asian populations points to the North Caucasus-Lower Volga area as the homeland of Indo-Anatolian languages and to the Serednii Stih archaeological culture of the Dnipro-Don area as the homeland of Indo-European languages. The Caucasus-Lower Volga people had diverse distal roots, estimated using the qpAdm software on the left barplot, as Caucasus hunter-gatherer (purple), Central Asian (red), Eastern hunter-gatherer (pink), and West Asian Neolithic (green). Caucasus-Lower Volga expansions, estimated using qpAdm on the right barplot as disseminated Caucasus Neolithic (blue)-Lower Volga Eneolithic (orange) proximal ancestries, mixing with the inhabitants of the North Pontic region (yellow), Volga region (yellow), and West Asia (green).

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Timely identification of the fetal red blood cell antigen genotype for the antigen to which the pregnant person is alloimmunized is vital for determining fetal risk for HDFN and guiding management. Presently in the US, recommended care is to determine fetal antigen genotype with reproductive partner testing and/or amniocentesis. This approach has many limitations, including availability of reproductive partner testing, risk of nonpaternity, and low uptake of invasive testing such as amniocentesis. These barriers to obtaining fetal antigen genotype information lead to pregnancies not at risk for HDFN undergoing burdensome monitoring and, in some cases, unnecessary intervention. PCR-based qualitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping is available in Europe, however, it is offered at later gestational ages, may require a repeat sample, has a higher frequency of inconclusive results for individuals of non-European ancestry, and entails logistical challenges related to shipping and insurance coverage for patients in the US. The availability of a NGS-based quantitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping in the US that is robust for diverse populations and applicable for singleton and twin pregnancies starting at 10 weeks gestation presents an opportunity to assess performance.

MethodsPatients with alloimmunized pregnancies undergoing clinical fetal antigen cfDNA analysis were recruited to the study along with the neonates resulting from the pregnancies. The laboratory issued the results prospectively as a part of clinical care. After delivery, neonatal buccal swabs were sent to an outside laboratory, blinded to the fetal cfDNA results, for antigen genotyping, and the results were compared. Concordance was reported for the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis for antigens to which the pregnant person was alloimmunized as well as for all antigens for which the pregnant person was genotype negative.

ResultsWe observed complete concordance between the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis result and neonatal genotypes for 503 calls, for 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV across a racial and ethnically diverse cohort.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that cfDNA analysis for determining fetal antigen genotype is more accurate than real-life application of the current recommendations, ie., partner testing and amniocentesis, in a diverse US population. In addition, this noninvasive approach reduces barriers to obtaining timely, accurate information about fetal antigen genotype. These results support the routine implementation of fetal antigen cfDNA analysis to guide care of alloimmunized pregnancies in the US.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599999

Methods: We use a probabilistic framework to estimate the likelihood that novel influenza virus cases would be detected through testing in different community and healthcare settings (urgent care, emergency department, hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU)) while at low frequencies in the United States. Parameters were informed by data on seasonal influenza virus activity and existing testing practices. Results: In a baseline scenario reflecting the presence of 100 novel virus infections with similar severity to seasonal influenza viruses, the median probability of detecting at least one infection per month was highest in urgent care settings (72%) and when community testing was conducted at random among the general population (77%). However, urgent care testing was over 15 times more efficient (estimated as the number of cases detected per 100,000 tests) due to the larger number of tests required for community testing. In scenarios that assumed increased clinical severity of novel virus infection, median detection probabilities increased across all healthcare settings, particularly in hospitals and ICUs (up to 100%) where testing also became more efficient. Conclusions: Our results suggest that novel influenza virus circulation is likely to be detected through existing healthcare surveillance, with the most efficient testing setting impacted by the disease severity profile. These analyses can help inform future testing strategies to maximize the likelihood of novel influenza detection.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599999
"Discovery of RdRp Thumb-1 as a novel broad-spectrum antiviral family of targets and MDL-001 as a potent broad-spectrum inhibitor thereof - Part I:                 A Bioinformatics and Deep Learning Approach","10.1101/2024.03.29.587401","biorxiv",248.85,0,0,0,247,"Woods, V.; Umansky, T.; Ramesh, N.; Russell, S.

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

Future DirectionsThis work paves the way for further development of MDL-001 and research for other broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that target the RdRp Thumb-1 domain.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

Addressing the challenges of low hit rates and the difficulty in exploring novel chemical spaces, this platform adopts adaptive molecular embeddings and stringent model training environments to enhance predictive capabilities and navigate uncharted molecular territories. We validate this approach through a case study targeting the AXL and BRD4 oncology targets, where ChemPrint achieved a 45.5% in vitro hit rate and identified 20 novel acting compounds. These compounds exhibited substantial chemical novelty, with an average Tanimoto similarity score of 0.32 to their training set, significantly diverging from known compounds and demonstrating ChemPrints capability to extrapolate, surpassing traditional benchmarks and industry standards.

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599999

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1715983599999

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

We investigated the association between long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 and all-cause mortality and mortality from a wide range of specific causes in all 3,108 counties in the contiguous U.S., 2007-2020. Monthly county-level mortality data were collected from the National Center for Health Statistics. Wildfire smoke PM2.5 concentration was derived from a 10x10 km2 resolution spatiotemporal model. Controlling for non-smoke PM2.5, air temperature, and unmeasured spatial and temporal confounders, we found a non-linear association between 12-month moving average concentration of smoke PM2.5 and monthly all-cause mortality rate. Relative to a month with the long-term smoke PM2.5 exposure below 0.1 g/m3, all-cause mortality increased by 0.40-1.54 and 3.65 deaths per 100,000 people per month when the 12-month moving average of PM2.5 concentration was of 0.1-5 and 5+ g/m3, respectively.

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

These viruses have spread across the Americas causing morbidity and mortality in both wild and domestic birds as well as some mammalian species, including cattle. Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes. Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases.

With no current treatments or reliable diagnostic markers, there is an urgent need to define the molecular underpinnings of these conditions. By studying bioenergetic characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocytes in over 16 healthy controls, 15 ME/CFS, and 15 LC, we find both ME/CFS and LC donors exhibit signs of elevated oxidative stress, relative to healthy controls, especially in the memory subset. Using a combination of flow cytometry, bulk RNA-seq analysis, mass spectrometry, and systems chemistry analysis, we also observed aberrations in ROS clearance pathways including elevated glutathione levels, decreases in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase levels, and glutathione peroxidase 4 mediated lipid oxidative damage. Critically, these changes in redox pathways show striking sex-specific trends. While females diagnosed with ME/CFS exhibit higher total ROS and mitochondrial calcium levels, males with an ME/CFS diagnosis have normal ROS levels, but larger changes in lipid oxidative damage. Further analyses show that higher ROS levels correlates with hyperproliferation of T cells in females, consistent with the known role of elevated ROS levels in the initiation of proliferation. This hyperproliferation of T cells can be attenuated by metformin, suggesting this FDA-approved drug as a possible treatment, as also suggested by a recent clinical study of LC patients. Thus, we report that both ME/CFS and LC are mechanistically related and could be diagnosed with quantitative blood cell measurements. We also suggest that effective, patient tailored drugs might be discovered using standard lymphocyte stimulation assays.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

Provided that the target complexes may be localised in noisy, three-dimensional tomographic reconstructions, averaging images of multiple instances of these molecules can lead to structures with sufficient resolution for de novo atomic modelling. Although many research groups have contributed image processing tools for these tasks, a lack of standardisation and inter-operability represents a barrier for newcomers to the field. Here, we present an image processing pipeline for electron tomography data in RELION-5, with functionality ranging from the import of unprocessed movies to the automated building of atomic models in the final maps. Our explicit definition of metadata items that describe the steps of our pipeline has been designed for inter-operability with other software tools and provides a framework for further standardisation.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

We report genome-wide data from 78 prehistoric North Pontic individuals to understand the genetic makeup of the people involved in these migrations and discover the reasons for their success. First, we show that native North Pontic foragers had ancestry not only from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 but also from European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. More dramatic inflows ensued during the Eneolithic, when migrants from the Caucasus-Lower Volga area7 moved westward, bypassing the local foragers to mix with Trypillian farmers advancing eastward. People of the Usatove archaeological group in the Northwest Pontic were formed ca. 4500 BCE with an equal measure of ancestry from the two expanding groups. A different Caucasus-Lower Volga group, moving westward in a distinct but temporally overlapping wave, avoided the farmers altogether, and blended with the foragers instead to form the people of the Serednii Stih archaeological complex7. A third wave of expansion occurred when Yamna descendants of the Serednii Stih forming ca. 4000 BCE expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 BCE). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna expansion is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka in Ukraine (3635-3383 BCE), a site of uninterrupted archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic-Bronze Age transition, and the likely epicenter of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders during its advance, a flexible strategy forged in the North Pontic region that may explain its peoples outsized success in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3-5,8-10.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715983599999
