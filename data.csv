Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post- vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1740002913129

The workflow of sample preparation for cryo-ET is rather complex; it involves vitrification by rapid freezing followed by cryo-Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling rendering the volumes of interest thin enough for cryo-ET data acquisition. The established protocols for single cells grown on or deposited on EM-grids are not suitable for multicellular plant tissues. Plunge-freezing does not yield vitrified samples in most cases and must be replaced by high-pressure freezing. This, in turn, necessitates extensive modifications of the subsequent FIB milling procedures. In this communication we describe procedures for sample screening, targeted FIB milling guided by cryo-fluorescence microscopy and a novel lamella trimming step that allows to obtain homogenously thin lamellae suitable for cryo-ET. We have tested all the steps along the workflow with a variety of plant tissues including the moss Physcomitrium patens and tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana and Limonium bicolor. We could demonstrate that the workflow optimized for plant tissues allows to attain subnanometer resolution in cases where subtomogram averaging is applicable.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Here we describe a system, which we term SOS splicing, that protects C. elegans and human genes from DNA transposon-mediated disruption by excising these TEs from host mRNAs. SOS splicing, which operates independently of the spliceosome, is a pattern recognition system triggered by base-pairing of inverted terminal repeat elements, which are a defining feature of the DNA transposons. We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human cells; AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges RTCB and AKAP17A, allowing RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision. We propose that SOS splicing is a novel, conserved, and RNA structure-directed mode of mRNA splicing and that one function of SOS splicing is to genetically buffer animals from the deleterious effects of TE-mediated gene perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

The spatial organization of cell surface proteins is central to these processes. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy and proximity labeling have advanced studies of surface protein associations, but the spatial organization of the complete surface proteome remains uncharted. In this study, we systematically mapped the surface proteome of human T-lymphocytes and B-lymphoblasts using proximity labeling of 85 antigens, identified from over 100 antibodies tested for binding to surface-exposed proteins. These experiments were coupled with an optimized data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry workflow to generate a robust dataset. Unsupervised clustering of the resulting interactome revealed functional modules, including well-characterized complexes such as the T-cell receptor and HLA class I/II, alongside novel clusters. Notably, we identified mitochondrial proteins localized to the surface, including the transcription factor TFAM, suggesting previously unappreciated roles for mitochondrial proteins at the plasma membrane. A high-accuracy machine learning classifier predicted over 6,000 surface protein associations, highlighting functional associations such as IL10RBs role as a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling. Spatial modeling of the surface proteome provided insights into protein dispersion patterns, distinguishing widely distributed proteins, such as CD45, from localized antigens, such as CD226 pointing to active mechanisms of regulating surface organization. This work provides a comprehensive map of the human surfaceome and a resource for exploring the spatial and functional dynamics of the cell membrane proteome.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

We demonstrate that fibrosis-inducing hematopoietic cells cause profibrotic reprogramming of perivascular CXCL12 abundant reticular (CAR) progenitor cells resulting in loss of their hematopoiesis-support and upregulation of osteogenic and pro-apoptotic programs. In turn, peritrabecular osteolineage cells (OLCs) are activated in an injury-specific, Wnt-dependent manner, comparable to skeletal repair. OLCs fuel bone marrow fibrosis through their expansion and skewed differentiation, resulting in osteosclerosis and expansion of Ly6a+ fibroblasts. NCAM1 expression marks peritrabecular OLCs and their expansion into the central marrow is specific for fibrosis in mice and patients. Peritrabecular stromal b-catenin expression is linked to fibrosis in patients and inhibition of Wnt signaling reduces bone marrow fibrosis and osteosclerosis, possibly being a clinically relevant therapeutic target.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Instead, these models implicitly reason about crucial sidechain interactions based on backbone geometry and known amino acid sequence labels. To address this, we present FAMPNN (Full-Atom MPNN), a sequence design method that explicitly models both sequence identity and sidechain conformation for each residue, where the per-token distribution of a residue's discrete amino acid identity and its continuous sidechain conformation are learned with a combined categorical cross-entropy and diffusion loss objective. We demonstrate that learning these distributions jointly is a highly synergistic task that both improves sequence recovery while achieving state-of-the-art sidechain packing. Furthermore, benefits from explicit full-atom modeling generalize from sequence recovery to practical protein design applications, such as zero-shot prediction of experimental binding and stability measurements.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

However, prioritizing causal common and rare non-coding variants in human disease, and understanding how selective pressures have shaped the non-coding genome, remains a significant challenge. Here, we predicted the effects of 15 million variants with deep learning models trained on single- cell ATAC-seq across 132 cellular contexts in adult and fetal brain and heart, producing nearly two billion context-specific predictions. Using these predictions, we distinguish candidate causal variants underlying human traits and diseases and their context-specific effects. While common variant effects are more cell-type-specific, rare variants exert more cell-type-shared regulatory effects, with selective pressures particularly targeting variants affecting fetal brain neurons. To prioritize de novo mutations with extreme regulatory effects, we developed FLARE, a context- specific functional genomic model of constraint. FLARE outperformed other methods in prioritizing case mutations from autism-affected families near syndromic autism-associated genes; for example, identifying mutation outliers near CNTNAP2 that would be missed by alternative approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating single-cell maps with population genetics and deep learning-based variant effect prediction to elucidate mechanisms of development and disease--ultimately, supporting the notion that genetic contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders are predominantly rare.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

This was achieved by electroporation of strains stably expressing a codon-optimized Cas9 with two separate DNA molecules, one encoding a selectable marker flanked by short homology arms and a second encoding a sgRNA under the control of the U6 snRNA promoter. However, the efficiency of desired homology-dependent repair relative to undesired non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) events can be low and variable. Here, we describe methods and strains enabling extremely efficient (~99%) homology-dependent genome editing in C. neoformans. This high-efficiency method requires two manipulations. First, we placed the sgRNA-expressing segment into the marker-containing DNA flanked by targeting homology; thus, only a single DNA molecule is introduced into cells. Second, we used a strain mutant for the non-homologous end-joining factor Ku80 (encoded by YKU80). We also report the engineering of a yku80::amdS mutant strain harboring an insertion mutation that can be removed scarlessly via recombination between direct repeats. This enables the functional restoration of YKU80 after homology-dependent genome editing via selection against the amdS marker using fluoroacetamide. This approach minimizes documented drawbacks of using Ku-defective strains in downstream experiments. Finally, we describe a plasmid series that enables rapid cloning of sgRNA-marker constructs for genomic manipulation of C. neoformans, including gene deletion and C-terminal tagging.

Currently, drugs and drug candidates against AR target the steroid-binding domain to antagonize or degrade AR. However, these compounds cannot therapeutically access largely intrinsically disordered truncated splice variants of AR, such as AR-V7, that only possess the DNA binding domain and are missing the ligand binding domain. Targeting intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors has remained challenging and is considered ""undruggable"". Herein, we leveraged a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand library in a cellular screen to identify degraders of AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We identified a covalent compound EN1441 that selectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in a proteasome-dependent manner through direct covalent targeting of an intrinsically disordered cysteine C125 in AR and AR-V7. EN1441 causes significant and selective destabilization of AR and AR-V7, leading to aggregation of AR/AR-V7 and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent with targeting both AR and AR-V7, we find that EN1441 completely inhibits total AR transcriptional activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells expressing both AR and AR-V7 compared to AR antagonists or degraders that only target the ligand binding domain of full-length AR, such as enzalutamide and ARV-110. Our results put forth a pathfinder molecule EN1441 that targets an intrinsically disordered cysteine within AR to destabilize, degrade, and inhibit both AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and highlights the utility of covalent ligand discovery approaches in directly targeting, destabilizing, inhibiting, and degrading classically undruggable transcription factor targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

The manual quantification of the FI from 2D microscopy images is tedious and biased, thus several automated methods have been developed. However, they still face challenges such as efficient nucleus segmentation and classification of fused and isolated myoblast nuclei. Here, we developed a novel workflow entirely based on AI for fully automated and unbiased quantification of the FI.

ResultsUsing current methods, we show that myoblast nuclei located above or below myotubes can significantly corrupt accurate FI computation. To circumvent this issue, we developed MyoFuse which enables an accurate and high-throughput segmentation and classification of myonuclei. It comprises a nuclei segmentation step using Cellpose, followed by a classification network trained with Svetlana. MyoFuse demonstrated strong accuracy when tested against manual annotation in mouse C2C12 and human primary myotubes. The trained classifier is able to differentiate myotube nuclei from myoblast nuclei based on myotube cytoplasm staining only. Experimental comparisons also highlighted that the previously developed methods lead to a significant overestimation of the FI.

ConclusionIn summary, we underscore the lack of accuracy of traditional methods for automated FI quantification. MyoFuse enables a direct and accurate segmentation of nuclei even in nuclei clusters frequently observed in myotubes. This workflow thus offers a new and more reliable method to evaluate the FI. It also limits the selection bias by processing large images.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

In frogs, however, odontogenesis is delayed, occurring instead during the postembryonic metamorphosis. Nearly all adult frogs have teeth on the upper jaw and lack lower jaw dentition, but a single species re-evolved mandibular teeth. Developmental-genetic mechanisms that underlie tooth formation in frogs are poorly understood, including whether an ancestral program is partially retained in the lower jaw that could facilitate the evolutionary reappearance of lost mandibular teeth. Using a developmental series of an unconventional model species, we assessed 1) if the gene network underlying odontogenic competence is conserved in the late-forming teeth of frogs; 2) if unique keratinized mouthparts, which function as an alternative feeding tool in anuran larvae, impede tooth induction; and 3) if transient tooth rudiments form in the anuran mandible. The tooth development network is conserved in the frog upper jaw, which displays dental expression patterns comparable to those of other vertebrates. There is, however, no evidence of tooth development in the mandible. Teeth emerge before keratinized mouthparts degenerate, but their location may be spatially constrained by keratin, and gene expression patterns of keratinized mouthparts and teeth overlap. We hypothesize that the novel mouthparts of tadpoles did not arise de novo but instead originated by partially co-opting the developmental program that typically mediates true tooth development.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

However, the full potential of real-time metagenomics remains largely unfulfilled due to a lack of accessible, open-source bioinformatic tools. We present MARTi (Metagenomic Analysis in Real-Time), an innovative open-source software designed for the real-time analysis, visualisation, and exploration of metagenomic data. MARTi supports various classification methods, including BLAST, Centrifuge, and Kraken2, letting users customise parameters and utilise their own databases for taxonomic classification and antimicrobial resistance analysis. With a user-friendly, browser-based graphical interface, MARTi provides dynamic, real-time updates on community composition and AMR gene identification. MARTi's architecture and operational flexibility make it suitable for diverse research applications, ranging from in-field analysis to large-scale metagenomic studies. Using both simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate MARTi's performance in read classification, taxon detection, and relative abundance estimation. By bridging the gap between sequencing and actionable insights, MARTi marks a significant advance in the accessibility and functionality of real-time metagenomic analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrx6 belongs to the Pet20-domain-containing protein family, consisting of Mrx6, Pet20, and Sue1. Notably, absence of Mrx6 leads to increased mtDNA copy number. Here, we identify the C-terminus of Mrx6 as essential for its stability and interaction with the mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33. Deletion of Mam33 mimics the effect of Mrx6 loss, resulting in elevated mtDNA copy number. Bioinformatics, mutational analyses, and immunoprecipitation studies reveal that a subcomplex of Mam33 and Mrx6 trimers interacts with the substrate recognition domain of the conserved mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1 through a bipartite motif in the Pet20 domain of Mrx6. Loss of Mrx6, its paralog Pet20, Mam33, or mutations disrupting the interaction between Mrx6 and Pim1 stabilize key proteins required for mtDNA maintenance, the RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the HMG-box-containing protein Cim1. We propose that Mrx6, alongside Pet20 and Mam33, regulates mtDNA copy number by modulating substrate degradation through Pim1. Additionally, Mrx6 loss alters Cim1s function, preventing the detrimental effect on mtDNA maintenance observed upon Cim1 overexpression. The presence of three Pet20-domain proteins in yeast implies broader roles of Lon protease substrate recognition beyond mtDNA regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

However, the inference of large trees remains constrained by logistical, computational, and methodological challenges. The Avian Tree of Life provides an ideal model for evaluating strategies to robustly infer macrophylogenies from intersecting datasets derived from smaller studies. In this study, we leveraged a comprehensive resource of sequence capture datasets to evaluate the phylogenetic accuracy and computational costs of four methodological approaches: (1) supermatrix approaches using concatenation, including the ""fast"" maximum likelihood (ML) methods, (2) filtering datasets to reduce heterogeneity, (3) supertree estimation based on published phylogenomic trees, and (4) a ""divide-and-conquer"" strategy, wherein smaller ML trees were estimated and subsequently combined using a supertree approach. Additionally, we examined the impact of these methods on divergence time estimation using a dataset that includes newly vetted fossil calibrations for the Avian Tree of Life.

Accurately identifying regions that are spatially coherent in both gene expression and physical tissue structures is an emerging topic, but challenging due to the lack of ground truth labels which renders complicating validation of clustering consistency and reproducibility. This highlights a need for a computational evaluation framework to rigorously and unbiasedly assess clustering performance. Results: To address this gap, we propose STEAM (Spatial Transcriptomics Evaluation Algorithm and Metric), a user-friendly computational pipeline designed to evaluate the consistency and reliability of clustering results by leveraging machine learning classification and prediction methods, with the goal of maintaining the spatial proximity and gene expression patterns within clusters. We benchmarked STEAM on various public datasets, spanning multi-cell to single-cell resolution, as well as spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. The results highlighted its robustness and generalizability through comprehensive statistical evaluation metrics, such as Kappa score, F1 score, accuracy, and adjusted rand index. Notably, STEAM supports multi-sample training, enabling cross-replicate clustering consistency assessment. Moreover, STEAM provides practical guidance by comparing clustering results across multiple approaches; here, we evaluated four different methods, including spatial-aware and spatial-ignorant approaches. In summary, we believe that STEAM provides researchers a promising tool for evaluating clustering robustness and benchmarking clustering performance for spatial omics data, offering valuable insights to drive reproducible discoveries in spatial biology.

Australias geographic isolation, strict biosecurity measures and native dingo populations present a unique model for understanding the spread and evolution of canine viruses. However, aside from a few well-characterised pathogens, genomic data are scarce for many common dog viruses, limiting our understanding of their evolution and disease ecology. Using a metatranscriptomic approach we identified the viruses in dogs and dingoes from various geographical locations across mainland Australia and sample types, revealing 86 vertebrate-associated viruses belonging to 16 distinct species, including a new vesivirus-like species. Many of the viruses identified here have not previously been sequenced in Australia. We identified important dog pathogens associated with canine infectious respiratory disease syndrome--such as canine pneumovirus, canine herpesvirus, and canine respiratory coronavirus--and gastroenteritis, including canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and rotavirus A. The sequences of Australian canine viruses often occupied multiple distinct clades phylogenetically and had little geographic structure, suggesting multiple virus introductions and subsequent spread across the country. Notably, we identified the first RNA virus - rotavirus A - in a dingo. This virus was phylogenetically distinct from dog-associated rotavirus A sequences and more closely related to viruses found in humans and bats, indicative of the past cross-species transmission of a reassortant virus into dingoes, and shows dingoes and domestic dogs may have distinct viromes. Our findings expand the knowledge of viral diversity in Australian canines, improving our understanding of viral movement into and within Australia, as well as the potential zoonotic risks associated with dogs and dingoes.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

While stimulation of vagal efferent neurons has been previously demonstrated to reduce maladaptive host responses during endotoxemia, only selective stimulation of vagal afferent neurons was able to inhibit TLR7-induced macrophage activation and neutrophil recruitment in the lung. These anti-inflammatory actions are facilitated by systemic increases in epinephrine, as VNS significantly increased epinephrine in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and inhibition of epinephrine production eliminated the protection afforded by VNS. Selective afferent VNS induced activation in the nucleus tractus solitarius and the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Inhibition of neuronal activity in this brain region that controls peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity rendered VNS ineffective. Activation of the {beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) is critical for innate immune cell suppression, as the anti-inflammatory effects of VNS were eliminated in {beta}2AR-knock out mice, and with pharmacological inhibition of the {beta}2AR. Analysis of the immune cells responding to R848 critically identified that plasmacytoid dendritic cells were refractive to inhibition by VNS, and this corresponded to lack of {beta}2AR expression. These findings demonstrate a novel neuro-immune circuit elicited by VNS that can control acute lung inflammation.

SummaryWe have identified a novel neuro-immune circuit activated by afferent vagus nerve stimulation to reduce acute lung inflammation. This effect was dependent on vagal-induced adrenal gland-derived epinephrine release that initiates anti-inflammatory {beta}2-adrenergic receptor signaling in innate immune cells within the lung.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

This poses the question of how the size and pattern of a regenerating limb is matched to a widely varying animal size. Two interacting signaling molecules, SHH and FGF8, are produced at opposite sides of the regenerating limb and sustain tissue growth through a pair of oppositely-oriented signaling gradients. As the size of the regrowing tissue can vary more than three-fold depending on the size of the animal, it is unclear how the activities of these mutually dependent morphogens are maintained and subsequently terminated to determine appropriate growth. Scaling of limb regeneration suggests a size-dependent adaptation of morphogen gradient parameters. Inspired by this biological example, we theoretically investigate general mechanisms of morphogen-controlled growth arrest and proportional growth. In the proposed mechanism, tissue growth increases the spatial distance between the two morphogen gradients, thus providing negative feedback that eventually arrests morphogen activity and growth. We put forward two distinct scaling scenarios of morphogen gradients: either dynamic scaling with blastema size, where morphogen gradient parameters change dynamically with the growing tissue, or static scaling with animal size, where morphogen gradient parameters stay constant during blastema growth and only depend on animal size. We show that static scaling ensures proportional growth, but dynamic scaling does not. We compare theory predictions to experimental quantification of SHH and FGF8 morphogen gradient parameters at different time-points of regeneration in different-sized animals, indicating static scaling for some morphogen parameters, which is sufficient to ensure proportional growth in our model.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

How different immune cell types engage PRR- and guard protein-dependent defenses in response to infection is poorly understood. Here, we show that macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) respond in distinct ways to bacterial virulence activities. In macrophages, the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila deploys its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to deliver effector proteins that facilitate its robust intracellular replication. In contrast, T4SS activity triggers rapid DC death that potently restricts Legionella replication within this cell type. Intriguingly, we found that infected DCs exhibit considerable heterogeneity at the single cell level. Initially, a subset of DCs activate caspase-11 and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis and release IL-1{beta} early during infection. At later timepoints, a separate DC population undergoes apoptosis driven by T4SS effectors that block host protein synthesis, thereby depleting the levels of the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1 and cFLIP. Together, pyroptosis and effector-triggered apoptosis robustly restrict Legionella replication in DCs. Collectively, our work suggests a model where Mcl-1 and cFLIP guard host translation in DCs, and that macrophages and DCs distinctly employ innate immune sensors and guard proteins to mount divergent responses to Legionella infection.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Disruption of this bond, particularly following offspring loss, can result in profound trauma with long-lasting consequences. While considerable research has focused on the impact of maternal separation on offspring development, the biological effects of offspring loss on the mother remain largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the long-term effects of offspring loss on neuroplasticity, the oxytocin (OXT) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) systems, and stress-coping behaviors in Sprague-Dawley rat mothers. We compared mothers that experienced one day of motherhood followed by 19 days of offspring loss, mothers that were with their pups throughout the 20 days, and naive virgin rats. Our results reveal that mothers who lost their pups expressed increased oxytocin receptor binding and decreased dendritic spine density in limbic brain regions, with no changes in estrogen receptor  or calbindin cells. Additionally, separated mothers showed increased passive stress-coping behaviors in the forced swim test and elevated plasma corticosterone levels. Remarkably, the passive stress-coping behavior was rescued by central CRF receptor blockade but not by oxytocin treatment, suggesting that the CRF system plays a key role in the grieving process following offspring loss, and highlights the suitability of the rat model for studying maternal grief. This research provides insights into the complex neurobiology of grief, and suggests potential directions for future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

While septins preferentially bind convex membranes via amphipathic helices, their assembly on varied geometries in cells suggests additional localization cues. We tested the hypothesis that lipid composition directs septin assembly through lipid packing properties. Lipid mixtures varying in lipid packing were designed by molecular dynamics simulations and incorporated onto supported lipid bilayers to measure septin adsorption in vitro. Septins strongly favor loosely-packed, disordered lipid bilayers but additional geometry cues act in conjunction with this membrane property. Introducing tighter lipid packing in cells disrupted septin structures in a curvature dependent manner, specifically limiting septin assembly and retention along flat regions of the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates that packing defects and geometry jointly regulate septin localization and highlights how multiple membrane properties are integrated to control organization of the septin cytoskeleton.

Recently, Rio de Janeiro City developed its heat protocol, using the amount of hours spent over specific heat thresholds as its trigger metric. This study gathers mortality data by 17 different causes in Rio, in a 12.5 year period (2012-2024). We use Distributed Lag Non-Linear Models (DLNM) to assess the relationship between different heat exposure metrics to mortality among the young (< 65) and elderly (>=65y), including a novel metric called Heat Area Above a Threshold (HAAT). In the study period, there were 466,121 deaths in the city from natural causes. Deaths due to diabetes, hypertensive diseases, Alzheimers/dementia, renal failure and even undetermined deaths were strongly associated with extreme heat episodes, especially among the elderly. The proposed HAAT metric showed better performance on explaining mortality for most causes (10 out of the 17), when compared to temperature or heat index, or commonly used heat wave definitions. The results dialogue with Rios heat protocol, evaluating the cut-off points defined and proposing simpler definitions using the HAAT metric. An exposure to a HAAT of 64{degrees}C*h increases mortality by natural causes by 50%, and 91.2{degrees}C*h already doubles the mortality risk. Main strengths of the study lie on the comparison of different heat exposure metrics and the investigation of cause-specific mortality in a period when recent and remarkable heat waves occurred. There is still fragility when considering a compound index such as the Heat Index, and social and spatial differences on heat-related mortality should also be considered in future models. The proposed metric, however, appears as a relevant indicator to distinguish unusually warm days that lead to elevated mortality, and could guide definitions for Heat Warning Systems.","NA","medrxiv",1740002913129

We further identified human-specific transcriptomic features of imGCs and demonstrated functional roles of human imGC-enriched expression of a family of proton-transporting vacuolar-type ATPase subtypes in development of imGCs derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Our study reveals divergent gene expression patterns but convergent biological processes in the molecular characteristics of imGCs across species, highlighting the importance of conducting independent molecular and functional analyses for adult neurogenesis in different species.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

While recent advances in protein generative models, which learn probability distributions over amino acids conditioned on structural or evolutionary sequence contexts, have shown impressive performance in predicting various protein properties without task-specific training, their strong unsupervised prediction ability does not extend to all protein functions. In particular, their potential to improve protein stability prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we present SPURS, a novel deep learning framework that adapts and integrates two general-purpose protein generative models--a protein language model (ESM) and an inverse folding model (ProteinMPNN)--into an effective stability predictor. SPURS employs a lightweight neural network module to rewire per-residue structure representations learned by ProteinMPNN into the attention layers of ESM, thereby informing and enhancing ESM's sequence representation learning. This rewiring strategy enables SPURS to harness evolutionary patterns from both sequence and structure data, where the sequence likelihood distribution learned by ESM is conditioned on structure priors encoded by ProteinMPNN to predict mutation effects. We steer this integrated framework to a stability prediction model through supervised training on a recently released mega-scale thermostability dataset. Evaluations across 12 benchmark datasets showed that SPURS delivers accurate, rapid, scalable, and generalizable stability predictions, consistently outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SPURS demonstrates remarkable versatility in protein stability and function analyses: when combined with a protein language model, it accurately identifies protein functional sites in an unsupervised manner. Additionally, it enhances current low-N protein fitness prediction models by serving as a stability prior model to improve accuracy. These results highlight SPURS as a powerful tool to advance current protein stability prediction and machine learning-guided protein engineering workflows.

Despite the parent-of-origin being important in the etiology of the pregnancy, our knowledge of their causes is limited, especially at the point of conception. Using a dataset of 96,660 biopsies and a validation dataset of 44,324 from human blastocysts embryos generated by intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), we estimate that 1.1% of human conceptions (n=1,063) contain extra or missing chromosome sets in zygotes. We identify a maternal age effect, with a 1.059 per year increased risk in triploidy/haploidy (p=0.0008). In 0.03% of couples, we identified three or more triploid/haploid embryos, suggesting a personal risk effect (p=0.03). Genotype analysis of 55 triploid embryo biopsies and their parents show that one third of maternal triploid conceptions originate in meiosis I and two thirds in meiosis II. Seven of these embryos are inferred to have entirely failed to initiate meiotic recombination genome-wide, suggesting that human oocytes with pervasive meiotic recombination failure that are formed during fetal development are capable of ovulation in adult life. Finally, we identify a new type of genome-wide maternal isodiploidy (two maternal chromosome sets) in 0.05% of embryos (41 of 74,009).

As a result, a diverse array of protein variants can coexist within a single proteome, such as that of humans. However, until now, methods to detect, quantify, and evaluate the functional consequences of these variants have been lacking. Here we examined a large-scale proteogenomic dataset from 29 healthy human tissues and uncovered over 46,000 of unique single amino acid variants co-existing alongside their corresponding reference proteoforms. Our analysis reveals that substitutions preferentially occur in proteins with low expression levels and often affect less frequently encoded amino acids such as tryptophan, cysteine, histidine, or methionine. We found that the abundance of both genetic (SNPs, somatic mutations) and mistranslated protein variants mirror their allele frequencies in the human population. Moreover, we show that non-genetic substitutions provide a distinct route for exploring protein sequence space, circumventing the mutational constraints imposed by the genetic code. Further, we demonstrate that substitution prevalence correlates negatively with their predicted pathogenicity, particularly in proteins expressed at low levels. We identified hundreds of substituted non-genetic proteoforms that recur consistently in multiple individuals and map to annotated protein functional sites. We propose that these substitutions constitute a novel class of functional protein phenotypic variants. Finally, we illustrate the impact of active-site substitutions in genes such as GAPDH and hemoglobin and highlight potential non-genetic routes of immunoglobulin diversification. Collectively, our findings indicate that non-genetic amino acid substitutions in human proteins provide a recurring and specific route to expanding the functional proteome.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

This can inject adaptive variation - which is useful for breeders and conservationists - or reduce fitness, leading to reproductive isolation. Most theoretical work on hybrids involves haploid or diploid hybrids between two parental lineages, but real-world hybridization is often more complex. We introduce a simple fitness landscape model to predict hybrid fitness with arbitrary ploidy and an arbitrary number of hybridizing lineages. We test our model on published data from maize (Zea mays) and rye (Secale cereale), including hybrids between multiple inbred lines, both as diploids and synthetic tetraploids. Quantitative predictions for the effects of inbreeding, and the strength of progressive heterosis, are well supported. This suggests that the model captures the important properties of dosage and genetic interactions, and may help to unify theories of heterosis and reproductive isolation.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Due to the importance of the Asgard archaea for our understanding of cellular evolution and eukaryotic complexity, recent efforts have focused on better characterizing the genomic diversity of this lineage and its relatives from the TACK archaea. Newly discovered lineages, the Njordarchaeales and Panguiarchaeales, are difficult to place, branching either with Korarchaeota or Asgard archaea. The phylogenetic position of these taxa is important because they include genome-reduced and potentially symbiotic lineages, which may help to inform our understanding of genome evolution and the evolution of symbiotic interactions within Asgard archaea and their relatives. To resolve the placement of Njordarchaeales and Panguiarchaeales in the archaeal tree, we performed a range of phylogenetic analyses revealing that the Njordarchaeales and Pangiuarchaeales constitute the newly-identified class Njordarchaeia within the Asgard archaea. Members of the Njordarchaeia exhibit hallmarks of adaptations to (hyper-) thermophilic lifestyles, which may contribute conflicting signals to phylogenetic analyses. Panguiarchaeum appears to be metabolically distinct from its relatives, displaying reduced metabolic potential and various auxotrophies. Gene tree-species tree reconciliation recovers a complex common ancestor of Asgard archaea that encoded the Wood Ljungdahl pathway, however the subsequent loss of this pathway during the reductive evolution of Panguiarchaeum may have been associated with the switch to a symbiotic lifestyle based on H2 syntrophy. Our analyses identify Panguiarchaeum as the first described Asgard archaea lineage with streamlined genomes that show indications for a symbiotic lifestyle.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

The expression of conserved bilaterian patterning genes in echinoderms provides a molecular framework for resolving this puzzle. Recent studies in juvenile asteroids suggest that the bilaterian antero-posterior axis maps onto the medio-lateral axis that is perpendicular to each of the five rays of the pentaradial body plan. Here we test this hypothesis in another echinoderm class, the ophiuroids, using the cosmopolitan brittle star Amphipholis squamata. Our results show that the general principles of axial patterning are similar to those described in asteroids, and comparisons with existing molecular data from other echinoderm taxa support the idea that medio-lateral deployment of the AP patterning program across the rays predates the evolution of the asterozoan and likely the echinoderm crown-groups. Our data also reveal expression differences between A. squamata and asteroids, which we attribute to secondary modifications specific to ophiuroids. Together, this work provides important comparative data to reconstruct the evolution of axial properties in echinoderm body plans.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

We used this model to characterize the effect of lipid binding and mutations in variants of concern to the Orf9b:Tom70 equilibrium.

Yet our understanding of value-based decision-making comes primarily from studying individuals in isolation, leaving open fundamental questions about how animals adapt their strategies during social competition. Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game, in which freely-moving mice make value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrate real-time spatial information about  self and the opponent to flexibly shift their preference towards safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice and reinforcement learning agents reveal that these behavioural adaptations cannot be explained by simple reward learning, but are instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of neural activity, we found that in addition to opponent effects, decisions under competition were also noisier and more sensitive to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for neural recordings and perturbations. Together, this work reveals a fundamental mechanism for competitive foraging, and proposes novel quantitative frameworks towards understanding value-based decision-making in a fast-changing social environment.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

However, its application to genebank accessions is limited by missing geographic origin data. To address this limitation, we explored the use of neural networks to predict the geographic origins of barley accessions and integrate imputed environmental data into GEA. Neural networks demonstrated high accuracy in cross-validation but occasionally produced ecologically implausible predictions as models solely considered geographical proximity. For example, some predicted origins were located within non-arable regions, such as the Mediterranean Sea. Using barley flowering time genes as benchmarks, GEA integrating imputed environmental data (N=11,032) displayed partially concordant yet complementary detection of genomic regions near flowering time genes compared to regular GEA (N=1,626), highlighting the potential of GEA with imputed data to complement regular GEA in uncovering novel adaptive loci. Also, contrary to our initial hypothesis anticipating a significant improvement in GEA performance by increasing sample size, our simulations yield unexpected insights. Our study suggests potential limitations in the sensitivity of GEA approaches to the considerable expansion in sample size achieved through predicting missing geographical data. Overall, our study provides insights into leveraging incomplete geographical origin data by integrating deep learning with GEA.

Previous work on eukaryotic cytoskeletal elements such as actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments investigating the mechanisms of polymerization have been critical to understand how cells control the assembly of the cytoskeleton. Most biophysical analyses have considered cooperative versus isodesmic modes of polymerization; this framework is useful for specifying functions of regulatory proteins that control nucleation and understanding how cells regulate elongation in time and space. The septins are considered a fourth component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, but they are poorly understood in many ways despite their conserved roles in membrane dynamics, cytokinesis, and cell shape, and in their links to a myriad of human diseases. Because septin function is intimately linked to their assembled state, we set out to investigate the mechanisms by which septin polymers elongate under different conditions. We used simulations, in vitro reconstitution of purified septin complexes, and quantitative microscopy to directly interrogate septin polymerization behaviors in solution and on synthetic lipid bilayers of different geometries. We first used reactive Brownian dynamics simulations to determine if the presence of a membrane induces cooperativity to septin polymerization. We then used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to assess septins ability to form filaments in solution at different salt conditions. Finally, we investigated septin membrane adsorption and polymerization on planar and curved supported lipid bilayers. Septins clearly show signs of salt-dependent cooperative assembly in solution, but cooperativity is limited by binding a membrane. Thus, septin assembly is dramatically influenced by extrinsic conditions and substrate properties and can show properties of both isodesmic and cooperative polymers. This versatility in assembly modes may explain the extensive array of assembly types, functions, and subcellular locations in which septins act.

SIGNIFICANCEThe septin cytoskeleton plays conserved and essential roles in cell division, membrane remodeling, and intracellular signaling with links to varied human diseases. Unlike actin and microtubules, whose polymerization dynamics have been extensively characterized, the molecular details of septin polymerization remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mode of septin polymerization through the lens of isodesmic and cooperative polymer assembly models in solution, on planar and curved supported membranes, and under different ionic conditions. Our findings show that the mechanisms of septin assembly are highly sensitive to ionic conditions, membrane geometry, and protein concentrations. Notably, assembly can show either cooperative or isodesmic properties depending on context, thereby revealing unexpected plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Building on their success, models have been developed for predicting the 3D structure of non-coding RNAs. Unfortunately, these models are much less accurate than their protein counterparts. In this paper, we highlight differences between protein and RNA structure, and demonstrate methods for deep learning targeted at addressing those differences, with the aim of prompting discussion on these topics. We present an RNA-specific pipeline for generating structural Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs). Derived from the structural alignments, we introduce engineered evolutionary features that strongly inform RNA structure. Further, from the crystal structure, we derive structural features describing RNA base pairing. These evolutionary and structural features can be used in loss functions at different stages of training. Finally, we discuss different cropping strategies informed by RNA structure.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

The GLV is also increasingly being used to infer species interactions and predict dynamics from empirical data on microbial communities in particular. However, despite its widespread use, the accuracy of the GLV's pairwise interaction structure in capturing the unseen dynamics of microbial consumer-resource interactions arising from resource competition and metabolite exchanges remains unclear. Here, we rigorously quantify how well the GLV can represent the dynamics of a general mathematical model that encapsulates key consumer-resource processes in microbial communities. We find that the GLV significantly misrepresents the feasibility, stability, and reactivity of microbial communities above a threshold, biologically feasible level of consumer-resource coupling because it omits higher-order nonlinear interactions. We show that the probability of the GLV making inaccurate predictions can be quantified by a simple, empirically accessible measure of timescale separation between consumers and resources. These insights advance understanding of the temporal dynamics in resource-mediated microbial interactions and provide a method to gauge the GLV's reliability under various empirical and theoretical scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

A key debate in the field centers on whether compositional methods are necessary for DA analysis, which is challenging to answer due to the lack of ground truth data. To address this gap, we created the Bioconductor data package MicrobiomeBenchmarkData, featuring three microbiome datasets with established biological ground truths: 1) diverse oral microbiomes from supragingival and subgingival plaques, expected to favor aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, respectively, 2) low-diversity microbiomes from healthy vaginas and bacterial vaginosis, conditions that have been well-characterized through cell culture and microscopy, and 3) a spike-in dataset with constant, known absolute abundances of three bacteria. We benchmarked 17 DA approaches and demonstrated that compositional DA methods are not beneficial but rather lack sensitivity, show increased variability in constant-abundance spike-ins, and, most surprisingly, more frequently produce paradoxical results with DA in the wrong direction for the low-diversity microbiome. Conversely, commonly used methods in microbiome literature, such as LEfSe, the Wilcoxon test, and RNA-seq-derived methods, performed best. We conclude that researchers continue using widely adopted non-parametric or RNA-seq DA methods and that further development of compositional methods includes benchmarking against datasets with known biological ground truth.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Pancreatic {beta} cells and SC{beta} cells reside in complex microtissues (islets or spheroids) and can therefore be potentially modulated by hundreds of autocrine and paracrine signals.

However, the fine-scale, complex decision-making of animals can pose challenges for the accurate prediction of trajectories. Step selection functions (SSFs), a common tool for inferring relationships between animal movement and the environment, are also increasingly used to simulate animal trajectories for prediction. Although admitting a lot of flexibility, the SSF framework is limited to its reliance on pre-defined functional forms for fitting to data, and SSFs that involve complex functional forms to model detailed processes can be prohibitively difficult to fit and interpret. Here, we present deepSSF, an approach to fit and predict animal movement data using deep learning. Whilst not specific to any particular model, we denote the deepSSF approach as building and training a neural network architecture that receives multiple environmental layers and scalar values as inputs, and outputs a single layer representing the next-step probability. To demonstrate a deepSSF model, we build a model in PyTorch that has distinct but interacting habitat selection and movement subnetworks, which allows for explicit representation of both processes and interpretable intermediate outputs. We apply our model to GPS data of introduced water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in the tropical savannas of Northern Australia. Our deepSSF model was able to learn features that are present in the habitat covariate layers, such as linear features (rivers, forest edges), and the composition of certain habitat areas, without having to specify them pre-emptively within the SSF framework. It was also able to capture the complex interactions between the habitat covariates as well as temporal dynamics across time of day and year. We expect that the deepSSF approach will generate accurate and informative animal movement trajectories, which can be used for deepening our understanding of animal-environment systems and for the practical management of species. Considering the wide range of deep learning tools, the deepSSF approach could be extended to represent memory and social dynamic processes, with the potential for integrating non-spatial data sources such as accelerometers and physiological sensors","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

ASPM is a key regulator of cortical size and cell proliferation expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal progenitors but not in differentiated neurons. We found that Aspm gain-of-function knock-in mice exhibit macrocephaly, excessive embryonic neurogenesis with expanded outer radial glia, an increased excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) ratio, brain hyperconnectivity, and social-cognitive deficits with male specificity. Our results suggest that macrocephaly in ASD is not a proportional expansion of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but a shift in the E-I ratio, independent of the expression patterns of the causative gene. Thus, macrocephaly alone can cause a subset of ASD-like symptoms.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

The human microbiota is known to influence oral tolerance, but the microbial mechanisms directly involved in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that human saliva harbors peanut-degrading bacteria that metabolize immunodominant allergens (Ara h 1 and Ara h 2) and alter IgE binding. Additionally, we provide in vivo evidence showing that oral bacteria metabolize peanut allergens, influencing systemic allergen exposure and the severity of anaphylaxis. Finally, in a clinical study, we observe that common peanut-degrading bacteria, such as Rothia, from the oral cavity, are more abundant in peanut-allergic patients who exhibit better tolerance to allergen exposure. Altogether, these results demonstrate the role of the human microbiota in modulating IgE-mediated reactions through allergen metabolism. These findings reveal a novel microbial mechanism with potential to prevent, or reduce, the severity of IgE-mediated anaphylaxis.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Here, to explore hyperparasitism in Archaea, we focused on ultra-small archaea of the phylum Nanohaloarchaeota, a distinct lineage within the DPANN superphylum, which establish obligate symbiotic interactions with extreme halophiles of the class Halobacteria. We assembled five metagenomes originating from geothermally influenced salt lakes in the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, and reconstructed the viromes associated with both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea. Both archaeal lineages were associated with viruses from four distinct groups, including head-tailed viruses (class Caudoviricetes), tailless icosahedral viruses, pleomorphic viruses and spindle-shaped viruses, which represent 12 previously undescribed families. The haloarchaeal viruses (HVs) and nanohaloarchaeal viruses (NHVs) are only distantly related, suggesting that viruses from the four groups co-evolved with their respective hosts for an extended period, likely since the divergence of the two archaeal lineages from their last common ancestor. Consistently, our results show that HVs and NHVs are well-adapted to replicate in their respective hosts and to thrive in hypersaline environments. No evidence of host switching between haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea was obtained, but multiple horizontal transfers of genes implicated in virion structure and morphogenesis between HVs and NHVs were detected. We also identified several NHVs-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes implicated in nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms, which could enhance the metabolic capabilities of the nanohaloarchaeal hosts that have highly reduced genomes. Finally, in addition to HVs and NHVs, we describe plasmid-derived virus satellites that appear to have originated convergently to parasitize spindle-shaped viruses of both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea, uncovering an additional layer of parasitism. Collectively, our findings fill the knowledge gap on the diversity of HVs and NHVs, highlight the complexity of virus-host and virus-virus interactions in hypersaline environments, and open doors for further mining of the virosphere of the globally distributed DPANN archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Despite intrinsic links to their oncogenic potential, the fidelity and mechanisms of ecDNA inheritance are poorly understood. Here, we show that ecDNA are protected against cytosolic mis-segregation through mitotic clustering and by tethering to the telomeric and subtelomeric regions of mitotic chromosomes. ecDNA-chromosome tethering depends on BRD4 transcriptional co-activation and mitotic transcription of the long non-coding RNA PVT1, which is co-amplified with MYC in colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines. Disruption of ecDNA-chromosome tethering through BRD4 inhibition, PVT1 depletion, or inhibiting mitotic transcription results in cytosolic mis-segregation, ecDNA reintegration, and the formation of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs). We propose that nuclear inheritance of ecDNA is facilitated by an RNA-mediated physical tether that links ecDNA to mitotic chromosomes and thus protects against cytosolic mis-segregation and chromosomal integration.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1), with its high case fatality rate and potential for adaptation in avian reservoirs, is a prime candidate for triggering such a pandemic. We applied the Viral Trait Assessment for Pandemics (ViTAP) model, a quantitative framework, to assess the pandemic potential of H5N1 strains currently circulating in the United States. Through a systematic literature review and structured expert elicitation involving virologists and epidemiologists, we refined and validated ViTAP scores across 11 key viral traits. The resulting assessment yielded a final ViTAP score of 3.28 out of 5, placing the U.S. H5N1 strains in the moderate-to-high risk category. This elevated risk is driven by the viruss high human fatality rate, its segmented RNA genome enabling reassortment, and its propensity for mutation. Sensitivity analyses highlight the transmission mode of the virus as a critical factor, with even minor increases in human-to-human spread dramatically escalating the pandemic threat. Comparisons with historical pandemics underscore the potential for H5N1 to rival the devastating impact of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic.

Using these methods, we succeeded in simultaneous expression of six non-G-start tRNA from monocistronic six DNA templates in the PURE system. Furthermore, we developed a method that combines the direct tRNA linkage and HDVR attachment methods (termed tRNA array method). Using this method, we succeeded in simultaneous expression of all 21 tRNAs from a single polycistronic DNA template in the PURE system. The tRNA mixture produced by the tRNA array method supported a similar level of translation to the individually synthesized tRNA mixture. Additionally, we demonstrated that the minimal tRNA sets prepared by the tRNA array method can be used for genetic code engineering. This study represents a step toward the realization of self-reproducible artificial cells and also provides an easy method for preparing all tRNAs useful for genetic code engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

A key part of OM biogenesis is insertion of OM proteins (OMPs) by the {beta}-barrel-assembly machinery (BAM). Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of a BAM complex isolated from Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a member of the phylum Bacteroidota that includes key human commensals and major anaerobic pathogens. This BAM complex is radically different from the canonical Escherichia coli system and includes an extensive extracellular canopy that overhangs the substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. We find that two of the novel subunits involved in forming the extracellular canopy are essential for BAM function. For one of these subunits isolation of a suppressor mutation allows the separation of their essential and non-essential functions. The need for a highly remodelled and enhanced BAM complex reflects the unusually complex membrane proteins found in the OM of the Bacteroidota.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

However, the microbial factors that influence host longevity and their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Using the expression of Caenorhabditis elegans FAT-7, a stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase, as a proxy for lifespan modulation, we conduct a genome-wide bacterial mutant screen and identify 26 Escherichia coli mutants that enhance host lifespan. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses reveal that these mutant diets induce oxidative stress and activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Lifespan extension requires the oxidative stress response regulators SKN-1, SEK-1, and HLH-30. Mechanistically, these effects are linked to reduced iron availability, as iron supplementation restores FAT-7 expression, suppresses UPRmt activation, and abolishes lifespan extension. Iron chelation mimics the pro-longevity effects of the mutant diets, highlighting dietary iron as a key modulator of aging. Our findings reveal a bacterial-host metabolic axis that links iron homeostasis, oxidative stress, and longevity in C. elegans.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

While the design and modeling of peptides in general has seen rapid advances since the advent of modern machine learning methods, existing deep learning models cannot effectively predict cyclic peptide structures containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), which are often crucial for peptide therapeutics. To address this limitation, we here extend the recent AF3-style model Boltz to cyclic peptides with ncAAs. In addition to the positional encoding offset, we used a simple yet effective extension of the cyclic offset encoding based on AlphaFold3s tokenization scheme that allows the modeling of cyclic peptides with modified residues. On a test set of peptides with ncAAs, our approach outperforms HighFold2 on 13/17 cases, with an average C RMSD of 1.877[A] and an average all-atom RMSD of 3.361[A]. Our results show that the cyclic offset encoding shown for AlphaFold2 generalizes to AlphaFold3-based models and can be extended to incorporate ncAAs, showing potential in the design of novel cyclic peptides with ncAAs for therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Sounds from multiple sources overlap in time and frequency. In particular, dynamic ""fore-ground"" sounds are often masked by more stationary ""background"" sounds. Human auditory cortex exhibits a hierarchical organization where background-invariant representations are progressively enhanced along the processing stream, from primary to non-primary regions. However, we do not know whether this organizational principle is conserved across species and which neural mechanisms drive this invariance. To address these questions, we investigated background invariance in ferret auditory cortex using functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), which enables large-scale, high-resolution recordings of hemodynamic responses. We measured responses across primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortical regions as ferrets passively listened to mixtures of natural sounds and their components in isolation. We found a hierarchical gradient of background invariance, mirroring findings in humans: responses in primary auditory cortex reflected contributions from both foreground and background sounds, while background invariance increased in higher-order auditory regions. Using a spectrotemporal filter-bank model, we found that in ferrets, this hierarchical structure could be largely explained by tuning to low-order acoustic features. However, this model failed to fully account for background invariance in human non-primary auditory cortex, suggesting that additional, higher-order mechanisms are crucial for background segregation in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

It has been hypothesized that fixation of a single morph can result in character release, whereby the monomorphic form evolves without the constraint of accommodating multiple adaptive peaks. However, the rates of evolution between populations fixed for different morphs likely depend on the specific adaptive zones occupied by each morph. We studied the evolution of dorsal color polymorphism (striped and unstriped morphs) in woodland salamanders (Plethodon), a North American radiation in which the polymorphism can be found in even the most distantly related species (~44 Ma divergence). We estimated a phylogenomic tree of Plethodon, representing all extant taxa with multiple samples for most species. Morphometric data suggest that between-species variation exists predominantly along an axis of relative body elongation, likely corresponding to a terrestrial-fossorial continuum. Polymorphic species occupy an intermediate phenotypic space between the evolutionary optima of striped and unstriped species, although polymorphic species did not have elevated speciation rates. Faster rates of body shape evolution were observed in unstriped species, suggesting that body elongation, which is co-adapted with the unstriped morph, is constrained by the polymorphism. Striped species had slower rates of evolution than polymorphic species, despite lacking the genetic constraints often associated with polymorphism. Our results demonstrate that rates of phenotypic evolution and speciation following character release can be asymmetric and idiosyncratic depending on the alternative adaptations of each morph.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

However, these models typically do not take into account chromatin accessibility, a major factor limiting gene regulation. We hypothesized that supplying accessibility as an input feature would allow a sequence-to-expression model to focus on important open regions of the genome. Using single-nucleus multiome RNA- and ATAC-sequencing data, we found that the predictive performance of such an augmented model was significantly greater than that of sequence-only or accessibility-only models with similar architectures. Specifically, its ability to predict the expression of highly variable genes and gene expression in other cell types improved, which we attribute to a reduction in bias originating from lowly variable genes. Moreover, post-hoc analyses revealed that higher attribution scores in the input DNA sequences of the augmented model conformed to accessibility, whereas those in the sequence-only model were scattered. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a pre-trained sequence-only model with both sequence and accessibility can boost performance even further. We also highlight the importance of sequencing depth in sequence-to-expression prediction. Altogether, the results of this study provide a compelling argument for the inclusion of chromatin accessibility in sequence-to-expression models, as this strategy can be implemented easily and may improve downstream applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Chromatin, particularly transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin, resists nuclear deformations through its mechanical response. However, chromatin also exhibits liquid-like properties, casting ambiguity on the physical mechanisms of chromatin-based nuclear elasticity. To determine how heterochromatin strengthens nuclear mechanical response, we performed polymer physics simulations of a nucleus model validated by micromechanical measurements and chromosome conformation capture data. The attachment of peripheral heterochromatin to the lamina is required to transmit forces directly to the chromatin and elicit its elastic response. Thus, increases in heterochromatin levels increase nuclear rigidity by increasing the linkages between chromatin and the lamina. Crosslinks within heterochromatin, such as HP1 proteins, can also stiffen nuclei, but only if chromatin is peripherally tethered. In contrast, heterochromatin affinity interactions that may drive liquid-liquid phase separation do not contribute to nuclear rigidity. When the nucleus is stretched, gel-like peripheral heterochromatin can bear stresses and deform, while the more fluid-like interior euchromatin is less perturbed. Thus, heterochromatins internal structure and stiffness may regulate nuclear mechanics via peripheral attachment to the lamina, while also enabling nuclear mechanosensing of external forces and external measurement of the nucleus internal architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

The considerable time and cost of training transformer models has motivated development of alternative approaches inspired by ideas from the signal-processing literature, such as state-space models (Mamba), Fourier transforms (Hyena), and wavelet transforms (MultiResNet). To evaluate these methods as potential replacements (or complements) for attention, we developed a software library bilby, implemented using Python and Jax/Flax, providing convolutional, attention, bidirectional Hyena, bidirectional Mamba, and striped-architecture models for supervised multi-task learning in functional genomics. We report a comparison of these architectures, testing several hyperparameters and variations, and reporting performance statistics for the withheld test set as well as downstream SNP classifiers. Relative to models comprising convolution and attention layers (implemented in Python and TensorFlow via the Baskerville library used by the Borzoi software), models comprising convolutional, bidirectional Mamba, and (optionally) attention layers achieve small but consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, for roughly comparable training times and parameter counts, when averaged across all output tracks and data splits (a proportional increase of 3-4% in Pearson R, and 1-2% in r2, with the highest gains achieved when Mamba and attention layers were combined in a striped architecture). In contrast, Hyena (when reimplemented as described in the literature) was not competitive with attention-based models at these tasks, while MultiResNet proved too slow to be practical. The gains in prediction accuracy of the Mamba-based models do not yet translate to significantly improved performance on downstream SNP classification tasks: benchmarks using a GTEx eQTL dataset yield roughly similar results for Mamba- and attention-based classifiers, with attention marginally outperforming Mamba in one metric (a difference of +0.007 in area under ROC) and slightly underperforming by another metric (a difference of -0.006 in Spearman rank correlation). We argue that these results suggest selective state-space models (such as Mamba and Striped Mamba) warrant further exploration for functional genomics tasks.

However, the drivers of these effects intracellularly remain unclear. Here, in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that loss of coordinated inter-organelle dynamics causally initiates metabolic inflexibility with age. In young animals, peroxisomes emerge as the priming orchestrators of the fasting response, simultaneously governing lipid droplets (LDs) utilization and mitochondrial bioenergetics. With age, peroxisomal priming is lost, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired dynamic nutrient responses during fasting. Notably, dietary restriction (DR) exerts a rejuvenating effect on peroxisomal function, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and promoting longevity. Our study uncovers the expansive network of organelles enabling lipid mobilization during youth, providing critical context to the poorly understood role of peroxisomes in actively maintaining organelle homeodynamics and metabolic flexibility throughout the aging process.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129

Acute cholesterol depletion increases the synthesis of very-long-chain (VLC) sphingomyelin, but a link between lipid sensing and sphingolipid synthesis is lacking. Using sphingolipid metabolic flux analysis, we observed that VLC-ceramide, the precursor to VLC complex sphingolipids that are produced in the Golgi apparatus, was rapidly consumed after cholesterol depletion, while synthesis of long-chain sphingolipids was unaffected. Sphingolipid trafficking assays showed that cholesterol depletion enhances VLC-Ceramide trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Changes in the sizes of coatomer II ER exit sites were correlated with increased VLC-Ceramide trafficking and concomitant increase in sphingomyelin. Depletion of Sec16A, a component of the COPII network, abolished VLC-SM synthesis. This study reveals ER-to-Golgi trafficking of VLC-Ceramide as a key regulatory node in organelle membrane homeostasis pathways.

This may result from long-term coevolution between viruses and bats, that have led to host adaptations contributing to an effective balance between strong antiviral responses with innate immune tolerance. To better understand these virus-host interactions, we combined comparative transcriptomics, phylogenomics and functional assays to characterize the evolution of bat innate immune antiviral factors. First, we stimulated the type I interferon immune pathway in Myotis yumanensis primary cells and identified guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5) as the most differentially expressed interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Phylogenomic analyses showed that bat GBP5 has been under strong episodic positive selection, with numerous rapidly evolving sites and species-specific gene duplications, suggesting past evolutionary arms races. Functional tests on GBP5 orthologs from ten bat species covering the >60 million years of Chiroptera evolution revealed species- and virus-specific restrictions against RNA viruses (retrovirus HIV, and rhabdoviruses European bat lyssavirus and VSV), which are typical signatures of adaptations to past viral epidemics. Interestingly, we also observed a lineage-specific loss of the GBP5 prenylation motif in the common ancestor of Pipistrellus and Eptesicus bats, associated with different GBP5 subcellular localization and loss of antiviral functions. Resurrection of the ancestral prenylation motif in Eptesicus fuscus GBP5 rescued its subcellular localization, but not the complete antiviral activities, suggesting that additional determinants are necessary for the antiviral restriction. Altogether, our results highlight adaptations that contribute to bat specific immunity and provide insights into the functional evolution of antiviral effector GBP5.

It has long been well documented that the microenvironment evolves over time, making it crucial to identify the optimal transplantation window to maximize therapeutic efficacy. However, it remains uncertain whether acute or delayed local cell transplantations better supports graft viability after stroke. Here, we show that delayed intracerebral transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) at 7 days post stroke significantly enhances graft proliferation and survival, compared to acute transplantation at 1 day post stroke, in a mouse model of large cortical stroke. Using in vivo bioluminescence imaging over a 6-week period post-transplantation, we observe a more than 5-fold increase in bioluminescence signal in mice that received delayed NPC therapy, compared to those that underwent acute NPC transplantation. The increased number of cell grafts in mice receiving delayed NPC transplantation was driven by increased proliferation rates early after transplantation, which subsequently declined to similarly low levels in both groups. Notably, we found that the majority of transplanted NPCs differentiated into neurons after 6 weeks, with no significant differences in the neuron-to-glia ratio between acute and delayed transplantation groups. These findings suggest that delayed NPC transplantation improves early graft survival and proliferation, which could help identify the optimal therapeutic window for maximizing the effectiveness of NPC-based therapies in stroke.","NA","biorxiv",1740002913129
