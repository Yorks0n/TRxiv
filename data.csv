Such targeting is challenging as it requires readout of the few outward facing peptide antigen residues and the avoidance of extensive contacts with the MHC carrier which is present on almost all cells. Here we describe the use of deep learning-based protein design tools to de novo design small proteins that arc above the peptide binding groove of pMHC complexes and make extensive contacts with the peptide. We identify specific binders for ten target pMHCs which when displayed on yeast bind the on-target pMHC tetramer but not closely related peptides. For five targets, incorporation of designs into chimeric antigen receptors leads to T-cell activation by the cognate pMHC complexes well above the background from complexes with peptides derived from proteome. Our approach can generate high specificity binders starting from either experimental or predicted structures of the target pMHC complexes, and should be widely useful for both protein and cell based pMHC targeting.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455989

Recent cross-species transmission events to mammals, including humans, highlight this risk. Critical determinants for cross-species and intra-species transmission include the ability to attach to and replicate in respiratory epithelial cells. Although these factors have been studied for HPAI H5N1 viruses in the past, limited studies are available for currently circulating strains.

MethodsWe compared level of adaptation to human respiratory tract of a HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b (H5N12022) virus with those of well characterized HPAI H5N1 clade 2.1.3.2 (H5N12005) and seasonal H3N22003 viruses by three methods. First, we compared pattern of virus attachment by virus histochemistry. Second, we compared efficiency of infection and replication, as well as innate immune responses in human respiratory epithelium in vitro. Lastly, we compared polymerase complex activity in a minigenome assay.

FindingsThe H5N12022 virus attached more abundantly to and replicated more efficiently in cells of the human respiratory tract compared to H5N12005 and H3N2 viruses. This increased replication was not associated with an increased polymerase activity of H5N12022 virus compared to H3N22003 virus. The efficient replication of H5N12022 virus infection induced a robust innate immune response almost comparable to H3N22003.

InterpretationThe pattern of virus attachment and replication efficiency of a HPAI H5N12022 virus resembled that of H3N22003 virus more closely than a HPAI H5N12005. This could contribute to an increased risk for both human infection and virus adaptations to humans.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSHighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viruses of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (GsGd) lineage (clade 2.3.4.4b) have the ability to spread to a wide range of domesticated and wild mammalian species, including humans. Cross species transmission and transmission among humans requires-- among other factors--efficient infection of epithelial cells in the respiratory epithelium of the upper respiratory tract.

Added value of this studyIn our study we show that a recent clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI H5N1 virus attached to and replicated more efficiently in respiratory epithelium than a clade 2.1.3.2 H5N1 virus that circulated in 2005.

Implications of all the available dataThese data suggest that there might be an increased risk of human infections with the currently circulating 2.3.4.4b HPAI H5N1 viruses, which might facilitate opportunities for human adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

The conventional method of aligning sequences of the query genome in parallel is to utilize a single thread per sequence. This results in poor CPU utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we designed optimizations to accelerate whole-genome alignment on multi-core processors and implemented them in a commonly used aligner, minimap2. Our improvements include a fine-grained parallel chaining method and a fast mechanism for differentiating primary and secondary chains. Our approach accelerates alignment of human, plant, and primate genomes by 1.6x to 7.2x without compromising accuracy.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

An outstanding question is whether SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences can directly induce inflammatory responses. In this study, we identify a region in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein with sequence homology to bacterial super-antigens (termed P3). Computational modeling predicts P3 binding to sites on MHC class I/II and the TCR that partially overlap with sites for the binding of staphylococcal enterotoxins B and H. Like SEB and SEH peptides, P3 stimulated 25-40% of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, increasing IFN-{gamma} and granzyme B production. viSNE and SPADE profiling identified overlapping and distinct IFN-{gamma} and GZMB subsets. The super-antigenic properties of P3 were further evident by its selective expansion of T cells expressing specific TCR V and V{beta} chain repertoires. In vivo experiments in mice revealed that the administration of P3 led to a significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF-. While the clinical significance of P3 in COVID-19 remains unclear, its homology to other mammalian proteins suggests a potential role for this peptide family in human inflammation and autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

However, most non-model organisms lack integral genomic resources such as reference genomes and recombination maps, limiting accurate evolutionary inference. Here, we explore the consequences of reference genome bias on the inference of genetic diversity, demographic histories, and recombination rates using gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), which, like most members of Canidae, are traditionally mapped to the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) reference genome. Whole genome sequence data from gray foxes were mapped to the gray fox reference genome and two heterospecific canid references (dog and Arctic fox; Vulpes lagopus). Our results reveal that reference bias significantly affects population genomic analyses. Mapping to the conspecific gray fox genome improved read pairing, increased detection of SNPs, especially rare variants, and reduced spurious variants. Estimates of nucleotide diversity ({pi}) and genetic differentiation (FST) were higher using the gray fox genome. We observed that mapping to heterospecific references leads to underestimates of population sizes, distorted demographic trajectories, and more variable recombination rates. These effects are further complicated by population-specific biases, which vary in their magnitude and direction across populations, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to mitigate reference bias. Importantly, FST outlier detection also differed among references, affecting functional interpretations. Collectively, this work addresses a critical gap in the rapidly expanding field of non-model species genomics by demonstrating the importance of using conspecific genomic resources in evolutionary research and illustrating how reliance on distantly related reference genomes can distort population genetic analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

However, healthcare decision makers need evidence of cost effectiveness to understand the cost/benefit of adopting this approach.

MethodsTo evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different smoking cessation interventions, and service delivery, we used a Markov model, adapted from previous National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on smoking cessation. This uses long-term epidemiological data to capture the prevalence of the smoking-related illnesses, where prevalence is estimated based on age, sex, and smoking status. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to capture joint parameter uncertainty.

ResultsAll smoking cessation interventions appeared cost-effective at a threshold of {pound}20,000 per quality-adjusted life year, compared to no intervention or behavioural support alone. Offering immediate smoking cessation as part of lung cancer screening appointments, compared with usual care (onward referral to stop smoking services) was also estimated to be cost-effective with a net monetary benefit of {pound}2,198 per person, and a saving of between {pound}34 and {pound}79 per person in reduced workplace absenteeism among working age attendees. Estimated healthcare cost savings were more than four times greater in the most deprived quintile compared to the least deprived, alongside a fivefold increase in QALYs accrued.

ConclusionsSmoking cessation interventions within lung cancer screening are cost-effective and should be integrated so that treatment is initiated during screening visits. This is likely to reduce overall costs to the health service, and wider integrated care systems, improve quality and length of life, and may lessen health inequalities.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topic?C_ST_ABSSmoking cessation interventions are known to be cost-effective in general. However, their cost-effectiveness specifically within lung cancer screening programmes, where they are not routinely commissioned, remains to be established.

What this study addsThis health economic analysis estimates that offering smoking cessation immediately within a lung cancer screening visits is a cost-effective intervention, with a substantial return on investment for the healthcare service, alongside a reduction in health inequalities and an increase in productivity for the wider economy.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis economic evaluation will provide those commissioning and planning healthcare services with evidence that supports the case for funding smoking cessation services integrated within lung cancer screening programmes as immediate, opt-out services.","NA","medrxiv",1733004455990

To address this question, we analyzed brief, task-free magnetoencephalographic recordings from over 1,000 individuals aged 4-89. We found that neurophysiological activity is significantly more similar between individuals in childhood than in adulthood, though periodic patterns of brain activity remain reliable markers of individuality across all ages. The cortical regions most critical for determining individuality shift across neurodevelopment and aging, with sensorimotor cortices becoming increasingly prominent in adulthood. These developmental changes in neurophysiology align closely with the expression of cortical genetic systems related to ion transport and neurotransmission, suggesting a growing influence of genetic factors on neurophysiological traits across the lifespan. Notably, this alignment peaks in late adolescence, a critical period when genetic factors significantly shape brain individuality. Overall, our findings highlight the role of sensorimotor regions in defining individual brain traits and reveal how genetic influences on these traits intensify with age. This study advances our understanding of the evolving biological foundations of inter-individual differences.

Lay summaryThis study examines how brain activity reflects the development of individuality across a persons life. Using magnetoencephalography to capture brief recordings of spontaneous brain activity, the researchers distinguished between over 1,000 individuals, spanning ages 4 to 89. They found that the brain regions most associated with individuality change with age: sensory and motor regions become increasingly distinctive in early adulthood, highlighting their role in shaping a persons unique characteristics of brain activity. The study also revealed that changes in brain activity across different ages correspond to specific patterns of gene expression, shedding light on how genetics influence brain individuality. These findings deepen our understanding of the biological foundations of inter-individual differences and how it evolves over the lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

In human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, we tile the PD-L1 locus using [~]25,000 CRISPR perturbations in constitutive and IFN{gamma}-stimulated conditions. We discover 67 enhancer- or repressor-like CREs and show that distal CREs tend to contact the promoter of PD-L1 and related genes. Next, we measure how loss of all [~]2,000 transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome impacts PD-L1 expression and, using this, we link specific TFs to individual CREs and reveal novel PD-L1 regulatory circuits. For one of these regulatory circuits, we confirm the binding of predicted trans-factors (SRF and BPTF) using CUT&RUN and show that loss of either the CRE or TFs potentiates the anti-cancer activity of primary T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor. Finally, we show that expression of these TFs correlates with PD-L1 expression in vivo in primary PDAC tumors and that somatic mutations in TFs can alter response and overall survival in immune checkpoint blockade-treated patients.

Mass spectrometry confirmed the transported proteins as the most abundant in EV membranes, and the presence of many receptor-interacting proteins demonstrates the utility of EVs for characterizing membrane protein interactomes. Cryo-electron tomography of EGFR-containing EVs reveals that EGFR forms clusters in the presence of EGF with a [~]3 nm gap between the inner membrane and cytoplasmic density. EGFR extracellular regions do not form regular arrays, suggesting that clustering is mediated by the intracellular region. Subtomogram averaging of the EGFR extracellular region (ECR) yielded a 15 [A] map into which the crystal structure of the ligand-bound EGFR ECR dimer fits well. These findings refine our understanding of EGFR activation, clustering, and signaling, and they establish EVs as a versatile platform for structural and functional characterization of human membrane proteins in a native-like environment.

Significance StatementAtomic or near-atomic resolution structural studies of proteins embedded in cell membranes have proven challenging. We show that transporting integral membrane proteins to cell-derived extracellular vesicles enables structural and functional studies of human membrane proteins in a native membrane environment. We have used this approach to visualize an active form of full-length Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and show that it forms clusters in the membrane and projects its cytoplasmic signaling domains [~]3 nm away from the membrane surface. EGFR is essential for normal development, but abnormal EGFR activity is associated with several human cancers and is the target of many anticancer therapies.

However, the effective indexing and analysis of this vast amount of data pose significant challenges to the scientific community. K-mer indexing has proven crucial in managing extensive datasets across a wide range of applications, including alignment, compression, dataset comparison, error correction, assembly, and quantification. As a result, developing efficient and scalable k-mer indexing methods has become an increasingly important area of research. Despite the progress made, current state-of-the-art indexing structures are predominantly static, necessitating resource-intensive index reconstruction when integrating new data. Recently, the need for dynamic indexing structures has been recognized. However, many proposed solutions are only pseudo-dynamic, requiring substantial updates to justify the costs of adding new datasets. In practice, applications often rely on standard hash tables to associate data with their k-mers, leading to high k-mer encoding rates exceeding 64 bits per k-mer. In this work, we introduce Brisk, a drop-in replacement for most k-mer dictionary applications. This novel hashmap-like data structure provides exceptional throughput while significantly reducing memory usage compared to existing dynamic associative indexes, particularly for large k-mer sizes. Brisk achieves this by leveraging hierarchical minimizer indexing and memory-efficient super-k-mer representation. We also introduce novel techniques for efficiently probing k-mers within a set of super-k-mers and managing duplicated minimizers. We believe that the methodologies developed in this work represent a significant advancement in the creation of efficient and scalable k-mer dictionaries, greatly facilitating their routine use in genomic data analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

While the functions and underlying neural circuitry of individual neocortical areas are well studied, it is unclear how these regions operate collectively to form percepts and implement cognitive processes. In particular, it remains unknown how distributed, potentially conflicting computations can be reconciled. Here we show that the reciprocal excitatory connections between cortical areas orchestrate neural dynamics to facilitate the gradual emergence of a  consensus across areas. We investigated the joint neural dynamics of primary (V1) and higher-order lateromedial (LM) visual areas in mice, using simultaneous multi-area electrophysiological recordings along with focal optogenetic perturbations to causally manipulate neural activity. We combined mechanistic circuit modeling with state-of-the-art data-driven nonlinear system identification, to construct biologically-constrained latent circuit models of the data that we could further interrogate. This approach revealed that long-range, reciprocal excitatory connections between V1 and LM implement an approximate line attractor in their joint dynamics, which promotes activity patterns encoding the presence of the stimulus consistently across the two areas. Further theoretical analyses revealed that the emergence of line attractor dynamics is a signature of a more general principle governing multi-area network dynamics: reciprocal inter-area excitatory connections reshape the dynamical landscape of the network, specifically slowing down the decay of activity patterns that encode stimulus features congruently across areas, while accelerating the decay of inconsistent patterns. This selective dynamic amplification leads to the emergence of multi-dimensional consensus between cortical areas about various stimulus features. Our analytical framework further predicted the timescales of specific activity patterns across areas, which we directly verified in our data. Therefore, by linking the anatomical organization of inter-area connections to the features they reconcile across areas, our work introduces a general theory of multi-area computation.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

This pipeline was designed to map microglial organization during normal and pathological brain development but can be adapted to any cell type. Using DeepCellMap, we capture the morphological diversity of microglia, {identify strong coupling between proliferative and phagocytic phenotypes, and show that distinct spatial clusters rarely overlap as human brain development progresses. Additionally, we uncover a novel association between microglia and blood vessels in fetal brains exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2. These findings offer insights into whether various microglial phenotypes form networks in the developing brain to occupy space, and in conditions involving haemorrhages, whether microglia respond to, or influence changes in blood vessel integrity.} DeepCellMap is available as open-source software and is a powerful tool for extracting spatial statistics and analyzing cellular organization in large tissue sections, accommodating various imaging modalities. This platform could open new avenues for studying brain development and related pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

Distinct protein pools, parental and nascent MCMs, and their precise equilibrium are essential to sustain error-free DNA replication1. However, the mechanism responsible for generating these pools and maintaining their equilibrium remains largely unexplored. Here, we identified CRL4DCAF12 as a new factor controlling the assembly of nascent MCM complexes. During MCM biogenesis, MCMBP facilitates the assembly and transport of newly synthesized MCM3-7 subcomplexes into the nucleus2,3. Once in the nucleus, the MCM2 subunit must be incorporated into the MCM3-7 subcomplex, while MCMBP needs to be removed. CRL4DCAF12 facilitates the degradation of MCMBP and thereby regulates the assembly of MCM2-7 complexes. The absence of CRL4DCAF12 adversely affects the level of chromatin-bound nascent MCMs, resulting in accelerated replication forks and genome instability. Collectively, our findings uncovered the molecular mechanism underlying nascent MCM production essential to counteract genome instability and tumor formation.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

By timely administering molecular regulators - such as transcription factors, RNAs, or small molecules - in a process that mimics in vivo embryonic development, stem cell differentiation can be guided toward a specific cell fate. A significant challenge in scaling up these therapies is that such differentiation strategies often result in mixed cellular populations. While synthetic biology approaches have been proposed to increase the yield of desired cell types, designing gene circuits that effectively redirect cell fate decisions requires mechanistic insight into the dynamics of endogenous regulatory networks that govern decision-making. In this work, we present a biomolecular adaptive controller based on an Incoherent Feedforward Loop (IFFL)-like topology designed to favor a specific cell fate. This controller requires minimal knowledge of the endogenous network as it exhibits adaptive, non-reference-based behavior. The synthetic circuit operates through a sequestration mechanism and a delay introduced by an intermediate species, producing an output that asymptotically approximates a discrete temporal derivative of its input, provided there is a sufficiently fast sequestration rate. By allowing the controller to actuate over a target species involved in the decision-making process, a tunable, synthetic bias is created that favors the production of the desired species with minimal alteration to the overall equilibrium landscape of the endogenous network. Through theoretical and computational analysis, we provide design guidelines for the controller's optimal operation, evaluate its performance under parametric perturbations, and extend its applicability to various examples of common multistable systems in biology.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

To facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NMR physiology and behaviour, we generated a long-read chromosomal-level genome assembly of the NMR. This genome was subsequently annotated and incorporated into multiple whole genome alignments in the Ensembl database. Our long-read assembly identified thousands of repeats and genes that were previously unassembled in the NMR and improved the results of routinely used short-read sequencing-based experiments such as RNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and ATAC-seq. We identified several spermatozoa related gene losses that may underlie the unique degenerative sperm phenotype in NMRs (IRGC, FSCB, AKAP3, MROH2B, CATSPER1, DCDC2C, ATP1A4, TEKT5, and ZAN), and an additional gene loss related to the established NK-cell absence in NMRs (PILRB). We resolved several tandem duplications in genes related to pathways underlying unique NMR adaptations including hypoxia tolerance, oxidative stress, and nervous system protection (TINF2, TCP1, KYAT1).

To address this, we sampled the entire thermoreceptor population using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of awake and anesthetized mice. We found that the vast majority of thermoreceptors respond bidirectionally, with an enhanced response to cool and a suppressed response to warm. Using in vivo pharmacology and computational modelling, we demonstrate that conductance changes in the cool-sensitive TRPM8 channel are sufficient to explain this bidirectional response type.

A confluence of biochemical experiments, immunofluorescence, and AI modeling suggest ACTN4 forms a heterodimeric complex with muscle-specific ACTN2 at the cardiac Z-disc, the cardiac sarcomere border. ACTN4 depletion from human iPSC-CMs stabilizes canonical sarcomere proteins and drives contractility-dependent cellular hypertrophy while ACTN4 overexpression destabilizes sarcomeres. ACTN4 depletion from zebrafish embryos specifically increases ventricular contractility which drives atrial enlargement, suggesting biomechanically driven atrial remodeling. ACTN4-associated phenotypes in both model systems lack hallmarks of cardiac disease models and an ACTN4 variant in humans is associated with reduced risk for disease.

In particular, yeasts have been reported as part of the core microbiome of seeds using next generation sequencing methods, but their diversity and functional roles remain largely undescribed. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by characterizing the diversity of seed-associated yeasts across nine plant species (crops and non-cultivated species) using culturomics, microscopy, and metabarcoding.

Our results show that seed-associated yeasts largely belong to Basidiomycota phylum and more particularly to the Tremellomycetes class. This yeast collection covers 15 genera (2 of Ascomycota and 13 of Basidiomycota). Out of the 219 isolates described, the most frequently isolated yeasts were Holtermaniella, Vishniacozyma, Filobasidium, Naganishia and Sporobolomyces. The yeasts from these dominant genera were isolated from multiple plant species (4 to 8), except for Naganishia which only originated from Solanum lycopersicum L.. These results are also consistent with the fact that these dominant taxa were recently identified as members of the core seed microbiome, indicating their high prevalence and abundance across diverse plant hosts and environments. Compared to previous plant yeast diversity surveys, the members from Ascomycota are less frequent in seeds and only represented here by the Aureobasidium and Taphrina genera. Altogether, these results suggest that yeasts are generally well-adapted to the aboveground habitats of plants, but seeds represent a specific habitat that diverse Basidiomycota yeasts can colonize.

Previous work focused mainly on Tibetans, establishing their genetic relatedness to East Asians and their genetic adaptation to high altitude, especially at EPAS1. Here, we present 87 new whole-genome sequences from 16 Himalayan populations and the insight they provide into the genomic history of the region. We show that population structure in the Himalayas began to emerge as early as 10,000 years ago, predating archaeological evidence of permanent habitation above 2,500 meters by approximately 6,000 years. The high prevalence of the introgressed adaptive EPAS1 haplotype in all high-altitude populations today supports a shared genetic origin and its importance for survival in this region. We also identify additional selection signals in genes associated with hypoxia, physical activity, immunity and metabolism which could have facilitated adaptation to the harsh environment. Over time, increasing genetic structure led to the diverse and strongly differentiated ethnic groups observed today, most of which maintained small population sizes throughout their history or experienced severe bottlenecks. Between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago, a few uniparental lineages became predominant, likely coinciding with the advent of agriculture, although significant population growth was not observed in the Himalayas except in the Tibetans. In more recent times, we detect bidirectional gene flow between high-altitude and lowland groups, occurring on both sides of the Himalayan range. The timing of this admixture aligns with the rise and expansion of historical regional powers, particularly during the Tibetan Empire and the northern Indian Gupta Empire. In the past few centuries, migrations to the Himalayas seem to have occurred alongside conflicts and population displacements in nearby regions and show some sex bias.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

Immunopathological damage plays a role in driving pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure in severe COVID-19. Therefore, dissecting the pulmonary immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to understand disease pathogenesis and identify immune pathways targetable by therapeutic intervention. Considering that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 enhances COVID-19 disease severity, therapeutic targeting of upstream signals that drive type 2 immunity may confer further protection. In this study, we investigate the role of the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis, a potent inducer of type 2 immunity in the lung, in a mouse model of COVID-19. Upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10, ST2-/- mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (69.2% vs 13.3% survival; P = 0.0005), as compared to wild-type mice. In a complementary pharmacologic approach, IL-33/ST2 signaling was inhibited using HpBARI_Hom2, a helminth derived protein that binds to mouse ST2 and blocks IL-33 signaling. In SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (60% vs 10% survival; P = 0.0035), as compared to inert control-treated mice. These data demonstrate that loss of IL-33/ST2 signaling confers protection during acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, implicating the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis as an enhancer of COVID-19 disease severity. The protection conferred by pharmacologic blockade of IL-33/ST2 signaling was independent of viral control, as HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had no reduction in viral titers. This finding suggests an immunopathogenic role for IL-33/ST2 signaling. One potential mechanism through which IL-33/ST2 signaling may drive severe disease is through enhancement of type 2 immune pathways including IL-5 production, as pulmonary IL-5 concentrations were found to depend on IL-33/ST2 signaling in acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

PIEZO1 channels assemble as propeller-shaped trimers5-7, which supposedly undergo a transition from a curved conformational state into a flattened state upon mechanical activation8-11. Whether this gating model also applies to PIEZO1 clusters and to what extent membrane curvature alters PIEZO1 conformation in living cells, is, however, still unclear. Here, we used MINFLUX nanoscopy to resolve the architecture of PIEZO1 clusters and demonstrate that PIEZO1 channels collectively deform the cell membrane into pit-shaped invaginations, which accommodate multiple channels and flatten in response to mechanical stimulation. Moreover, our data suggests that the deformability of the membrane and thus the conformation and sensitivity of PIEZO1 are altered by the architecture and the rigidity of the cytoskeleton. Together, our data provide previously unrecognized structural details about the subcellular distribution and the conformational variability of PIEZO1 in different cellular compartments, which challenge previously proposed hypotheses derived from studies of isolated channels and thus highlight the importance of examining PIEZO1 in its native environment, where additional factors contribute to channel function and structure.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

MethodsWe conducted a sibling-controlled cohort study based on all Swedish men who participated in mandatory military conscription examinations from 1972 to 1995 around the age of 18, and who completed standardized cardiorespiratory fitness testing. The outcome was T2D, defined as a composite endpoint of diagnosis in inpatient or specialist outpatient care, or dispensation of antidiabetic medication, until 31 December 2023.

Findings1 124 049 men, of which 477 453 were full siblings, with a mean age of 18.3 years at baseline were included. During follow-up, 115 958 men (48 089 full siblings) experienced a first T2D event at a median age of 53.4 years. Compared to the first decile of fitness, higher fitness levels were associated with a progressively lower risk of T2D. In cohort analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) in the second decile was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85), with a difference in the standardized cumulative incidence at age 65 of 4.3 (3.8 to 4.8) percentage points, dropping to a HR of 0.38 (0.36 to 0.39; incidence difference 17.8 [17.3 to 18.3] percentage points) in the tenth decile. When comparing full siblings, and thus controlling for all unobserved behavioral, environmental, and genetic confounders that they share, the association replicated, although with attenuation in magnitude. The HR in the second decile was 0.89 (0.85 to 0.94; incidence difference 2.3 [1.3 to 3.3] percentage points), and in the tenth decile it was 0.53 (0.50 to 0.57; incidence difference 10.9 [9.7 to 12.1] percentage points). Hypothetically shifting everyone in the first decile of fitness to the second decile was estimated to prevent 7.2% (6.4 to 8.0) of cases at age 65 in cohort vs. 4.6% (2.6 to 6.5) in full-sibling analysis. The association was similar in those with overweight as in those without.

InterpretationHigher levels of adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with lower risk of T2D in late adulthood, with clinically relevant associations starting already from very low levels of fitness, and similarly in those with overweight compared to those without. The association replicates, but becomes weaker, after adjusting for unobserved familial confounders shared between full siblings. This suggests that adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness is a robust marker of long-term T2D risk, but that conventional observational analysis may yield biased estimates.

FundingNone.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSType 2 diabetes is a growing public health issue, affecting at least half a billion people globally. Modifiable factors such as physical activity and the closely related trait cardiorespiratory fitness, which are inversely associated with type 2 diabetes, are declining, particularly among youth. Since these traits track from youth into adulthood, early-life interventions might have important implications for prevention. However, previous studies have typically focused on middle-aged individuals, leaving gaps in understanding whether fitness in youth is associated with type 2 diabetes in the long-term. Moreover, they have not been designed to adequately account for unobserved confounders. Triangulating the evidence across different methods, such as using sibling comparison analysis, would be important to obtain more accurate and reliable estimates of the causal relationship.

Added value of this studyIn this nationwide sibling-controlled cohort study encompassing more than 1 million young men, of which half a million were full siblings, higher levels of adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with a substantially lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes up to five decades later. The association was clinically relevant already from low levels of fitness, and it appeared similar in those with overweight as in those without overweight. While the association replicated after adjusting for unobserved familial confounders shared between full siblings, the magnitude of association attenuated by an amount that appeared clinically relevant. For example, the incidence differences between deciles of fitness were about 40% smaller in sibling-comparison analyses as compared to cohort analysis, and the preventable share of type 2 diabetes associated with hypothetical interventions shifting the population-level of fitness was reduced by about one-third.

Implications of all the available evidenceAdolescent cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong marker of long-term risk of type 2 diabetes, both in those with and without overweight. These findings render support to large-scale surveillance of fitness from a prevention perspective, and if the findings are confirmed using other lines of causal analysis, they may render support to interventions targeting fitness already from a young age. Yet, these findings also highlight the importance of triangulation for obtaining more reliable evidence of the magnitude of association, and shed light on the pitfalls of conventional observational analysis which may yield biased estimates.","NA","medrxiv",1733004455990

At low pH, protonated aminolipids facilitate efficient mRNA encapsulation, while their deprotonation at physiological pH drives LNP remodeling into a stable spherical structure, potentially aiding mRNA release during endosomal re-protonation and concomitant restructuring at low pH. Our study uncovers the pH-dependent phase transition of the Comirnaty lipid formulation at the molecular scale, highlighting the intricate interplay between lipid reorganization and aminolipid protonation. We observe a substantial shift in the aminolipid pKa, from 7-8 at the LNP surface to below 4 within the hydrophobic LNP core, resulting in an overall apparent pKa of the lipid nanoparticle of 6.3. The pH-dependent protonation significantly affects the aminolipid's localization, with protonated aminolipids enriched in vicinity of the mRNA and at the LNP surface at neutral pH. The lipid monolayer covering LNPs at neutral pH comprises cholesterol (60-65%), helper phospholipids (20-25%), PEGylated lipids (5%), and a mix of protonated and deprotonated aminolipids (5-10%). These findings provide mechanistic insights into aminolipids behavior in LNPs, offering a foundation for optimizing LNP design to enhance stability, tunable pH responses, and therapeutic efficacy.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

Our results demonstrate that (i) single neurons respond to local electrical stimulation with a stereotypical pattern of short-lived increased excitation, followed by sustained inhibition, (ii) that input into the hippocampus from neocortex takes ~100 ms, and (iii) that output from the hippocampus to the neocortex is gated by theta phase.

Here we reveal a yet unknown moonlighting role of MetAP1c in mycobacteria. We observe stationary phase-specific enhancement of expression and a unique 30S subunit affinity of MetAP1c. A 5[A] cryo-EM map of Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) MetAP1c-30S subunit complex manifests for the first time the binding of MetAP1c at the inter-subunit side in the vicinity of proteins S13 and S19. MetAP1c binding and resulting conformational changes make the 30S subunit unfit for association with the 50S subunit, thereby conferring an anti-association property on MetAP1c. We further constructed two N-terminal mutants to establish the pivotal role of the N-terminal extension of MetAP1c in its moonlighting function.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

However, access to additional easily engineered pairs is crucial for expanding the structural diversity of the ncAA toolbox in eukaryotes. The Escherichia coli-derived leucyl-tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS)/tRNA pair presents a particularly promising alternative. This pair has been engineered to charge a small yet structurally diverse group of ncAAs in eukaryotic cells. However, expanding the substrate scope of EcLeuRS has been difficult due to the suboptimal yeast-based directed evolution platform used for its engineering. In this study, we address this limitation by optimizing the yeast-based directed evolution platform for efficient selection of ncAA-selective EcLeuRS mutants. Using the optimized selection system, we demonstrate rapid isolation of many novel EcLeuRS mutants capable of incorporating various ncAAs in mammalian cells, including ornithine and N{varepsilon}-acetyl-methyllysine, a recently discovered post-translational modification in mammalian cells.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

Techniques such as multi-photon microscopy and holographic stimulation offer tremendous opportunities to understand the neural underpinnings of these memories. However, these techniques generally require animals to be head-fixed. There are few paradigms that test contextual fear conditioning in head-fixed mice, and none where the behavioral outcome following fear conditioning is freezing, the most common measure of fear in freely moving animals. To address this gap, we developed a contextual fear conditioning paradigm in head-fixed mice using virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an apparatus to deliver tail shocks (unconditioned stimulus, US) while mice navigated a VR environment (conditioned stimulus, CS). The acquisition of contextual fear was tested when the mice were reintroduced to the shock-paired VR environment the following day. We tested three different variations of this paradigm and, in all of them, observed an increased conditioned fear response characterized by increased freezing behavior. This was especially prominent during the first trial in the shock-paired VR environment, compared to a neutral environment where the mice received no shocks. Our results demonstrate that head-fixed mice can be fear conditioned in VR, discriminate between a feared and neutral VR context, and display freezing as a conditioned response, similar to freely behaving animals. Furthermore, using a two-photon microscope, we imaged from large populations of hippocampal CA1 neurons before, during, and following contextual fear conditioning. Our findings reconfirmed those from the literature on freely moving animals, showing that CA1 place cells undergo remapping and show narrower place fields following fear conditioning. Our approach offers new opportunities to study the neural mechanisms underlying the formation, recall, and extinction of contextual fear memories. As the head-fixed preparation is compatible with multi-photon microscopy and holographic stimulation, it enables long-term tracking and manipulation of cells throughout distinct memory stages and provides subcellular resolution for investigating axonal, dendritic, and synaptic dynamics in real-time.","NA","biorxiv",1733004455990

We analyzed DNA sequence data, derived from the blood cells of >700,000 participants in UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program, and developed new computational approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability at 15 highly polymorphic CAG-repeat loci. We found that expansion and contraction rates varied widely across these 15 loci, even for alleles of the same length; repeats at different loci also exhibited widely variable relative propensities to mutate in the germline versus the blood. The high somatic instability of TCF4 repeats enabled a genome-wide association analysis that identified seven loci at which inherited variants modulate TCF4 repeat instability in blood cells. Three of the implicated loci contained genes (MSH3, FAN1, and PMS2) that also modulate Huntingtons disease age-at-onset as well as somatic instability of the HTT repeat in blood; however, the specific genetic variants and their effects (instability-increasing or-decreasing) appeared to be tissue-specific and repeat-specific, suggesting that somatic mutation in different tissues--or of different repeats in the same tissue--proceeds independently and under the control of substantially different genetic variation. Additional modifier loci included DNA damage response genes ATAD5 and GADD45A. Analyzing DNA repeat expansions together with clinical data showed that inherited repeats in the 5 UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene are associated with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (OR=14.0 [5.7-34.3]) and liver diseases (OR=3.0 [1.5-5.9]).

Autonomous flower cooling could help to alleviate exposure of pollen and ovules to harmful temperatures, yet investigations on the thermal ecology of flowers in hot environments are still needed to evaluate the frequency, magnitude and ecological significance of floral thermoregulatory cooling. This paper reports a study on the thermal ecology of flower heads (=capitula) of 15 species of summer-blooming Asteraceae, tribe Cardueae, from hot-dry habitats in the southern Iberian Peninsula. Temperature inside (Tin) and outside (Tout) capitula were assessed under natural field conditions by two complementary sampling and measurement procedures, which provided information on the relationships between the two temperatures at the levels of individual capitula (""continuous recording"") and local plant populations (""instantaneous measurements""). Baselines for the Tin-Tout relationship in absence of physiological activity were obtained by exposing dehydrated capitula to variable ambient temperatures. To assess whether the co-flowering capitula of summer-blooming Asteraceae collectively defined a distinct thermal layer, the vertical distribution of capitula relative to the ground was quantified. Bees visiting capitula were watched and the temperature of the air beside the visited capitulum was measured. Capitula of all species were exposed to high ambient temperatures during long periods, yet their interior was cooler than the air for most of the time, with temperature differentials ({Delta}T=Tin-Tout) quite often approaching, and sometimes exceeding -10{degrees}C. The relationship between Tin and Tout was best described by a composite of steep and shallow linear relationships separated by a breakpoint ({Psi}, interspecific range=25{degrees}C-35{degrees}C). Capitula were weakly or not thermoregulated for Tout<{Psi}, but switched to intense, thermoregulated cooling when Tout>{Psi}. Narrow vertical distribution of capitula above ground and similar cooling responses by all species produced a refrigerated floral layer where most bees foraged at Tout>{Psi} and presumably visited cooled capitula. Thermoregulatory cooling of capitula can benefit plant reproduction by reducing pollen and ovule exposure to high temperature, but also the populations of insect mutualists and antagonists through habitat improvement via a refrigerated flower layer.
