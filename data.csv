We observed a pH-dependent survival of the virus, with infectious virus persisting throughout the cheese making process and for up to 60 days of aging in the pH 6.6 and 5.8 cheese groups. Whereas at pH 5.0, the virus did not survive the cheese making process. These findings were validated using the commercial raw milk cheese samples in which infectious virus was detected for up to 60 days of aging. Our study highlights the potential public health risks of consuming raw milk cheese, underscoring the need for additional mitigation steps in cheese production to prevent human exposure to infectious virus.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

PRC2 deposits the repressive chromatin mark H3 lysine 27 tri-methyl (H3K27me3) through a read-write loop that involves direct interactions between PRC2 and H3K27me3. According to current models, the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop is initiated by the PRC2 subunits JARID2 and PALI1 that mimic H3K27me3. However, it is unknown what restricts the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop from spreading H3K27me3 indefinitely. To answer this question, we generated mutant mice where PRC2 subunits cannot mimic H3K27me3. Unexpectedly, the mutations led to a homeotic transformation characteristic of a Polycomb gain-of-function in vivo and the spread of H3K27me3 beyond Polycomb domains in stem cells. Collectively, we show that H3K27me3 mimicry evolved to compete against the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop in a process that restrains PRC2 and restricts the spread of Polycomb domains.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

To address this challenge, we developed the Evidence Aggregator (EvAgg), a generative AI tool designed for rare disease diagnosis that systematically extracts relevant information from the scientific literature for any human gene. EvAgg provides a thorough and current summary of observed genetic variants and their associated clinical features, enabling rapid synthesis of evidence concerning gene-disease relationships. EvAgg demonstrates strong benchmark performance, achieving 97% recall in identifying relevant papers, 92% recall in detecting instances of genetic variation within those papers, and ~80% accuracy in extracting individual case and variant-level content (e.g. zygosity, inheritance, variant type, and phenotype). Further, EvAgg complemented the process of manual literature review by identifying a substantial number of additional relevant pieces of information. When tested with analysts in rare disease case analysis, EvAgg reduced review time by 34% (p-value < 0.002) and increased the number of papers, variants, and cases evaluated per unit time. These savings have the potential to reduce diagnostic latency and increase solve rates for challenging rare disease cases.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Our prior works show that shortening the S1/S2 loop by deleting either the FCS ({Delta}PRRA) or deleting an upstream sequence ({Delta}QTQTN), ablates spike processing, alters host protease usage, and attenuates infection in vitro and in vivo. With the importance of the loop length established, here we evaluated the impact of disrupting the FCS, but preserving the S1/S2 loop length. Using reverse genetics, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant that disrupts the FCS (PQQAR) but maintains its extended S1/S2 loop. The SARS-CoV-2 PQQAR mutant has reduced replication, decreased spike processing, and attenuated disease in vivo compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. These data, similar to the FCS deletion mutant, indicate that loss of the furin cleavage site attenuates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Importantly, we subsequently found that the PQQAR mutant is transmitted in the direct contact hamster model despite lacking an intact FCS. However, competition transmission showed that the mutant was attenuated compared to WT SARS-CoV-2. Together, the data argue that the FCS is required for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis but is not strictly required for viral transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1742076499972

However, traditional fish models, such as zebrafish, regenerate only dermal fin rays, which are neither homologous to limbs nor as cellularly complex. To address this, we employed a multi-omics approach leveraging the regenerative capacity of Polypterus senegalus, a fish species capable of full fin regeneration. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed extensive erythrocyte and myeloid cell infiltration during Polypterus fin regeneration. Spatial transcriptomics identified key cellular contributors to the blastema, while cross-species comparisons with axolotl limbs uncovered both common and divergent expression patterns of wound epidermis and blastema markers. Fin amputation triggered a conserved injury response, including sequential activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory programs and DNA damage repair in cycling cells. Hypoxia responses involved hif1a modulation, consistent with other regenerative models, but uniquely included the expression of hif4a in erythrocytes and the upregulation of a myoglobin gene in the wound epidermis. Furthermore, genome-wide chromatin profiling identified candidate regeneration-responsive elements. Together, these findings establish Polypterus as a powerful comparative model for identifying shared and derived mechanisms of limb and fin regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Complementarity to the miRNA seed region (miRNA nucleotides 2-7) is typically both necessary and sufficient for repression. Here, we investigate unusual sites with extensive complementarity to the miRNA 3' region (nucleotide 9 and onwards) but without complementarity to the seed. Top 3'-only sites bind as well as top canonical sites and impart similar repression, which can be further boosted by as few as 2-3 additional pairs to the miRNA seed. Despite these similarities, 3'-only sites have slower association and dissociation rates than seed-matched sites. They also impart different conformations to bound AGO-miRNA complexes than do seed-matched sites, and individual miRNAs differ substantially with respect to how well they bind their respective 3'-only sites. Thus, pairing to the seed is not required for binding and repression, or for a target to gain access to the 3' region of the guide. Overall, for those miRNAs which recognize 3'-only sites, those sites are estimated to constitute 0.5-1% of the endogenous targetome, a proportion resembling that of other rare but functional site types, such as 3'-compensatory sites.

Plants have evolved a complex set of cell-cycle genes with unique features. The high number of cyclin-CDK pairs in flowering plants complicates functional studies due to redundancy and diversification. It is critical to study simple systems in other plant lineages to better understand the functional integration of the cell-cycle control machinery and its evolution across land plants.

Through a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, we show that non-seed plants possess a simple repertoire of cyclin and CDK proteins, suggesting that the observed complexity in seed plants is a derived trait. The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha possess a streamlined set of core cell cycle genes with minimal redundancy during vegetative development. Using single-cell RNA-seq and fluorescent reporters, we found a precise, phase-specific pattern of expression for cell cycle genes. We demonstrated in vivo that only three cyclins are active, one at a given phase, without redundancy. Functional analyses revealed that MpCYCD;1 promotes cell cycle re-entry and disrupts differentiation, while overexpression of MpCYCA or MpCYCB;1 arrests the cell cycle, consistent with their respective roles at G1, S, and G2/M progression.

Our findings highlight the functional conservation of mechanisms for cell-cycle control across eukaryotes and provide insights into its ancestral state, revealing a minimal set of functional components required for multicellular development. This study advances our understanding of fundamental aspects of cell-cycle regulation and opens new possibilities for engineering plant growth.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet whether and how this ability supports adaptive behavior is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory system's ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision making task where participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across four experiments (total n = 472), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments, and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision making under uncertainty.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Fibroblasts, a major stromal cell, perform essential functions during inflammation, tissue remodeling, and wound healing; however, recent studies suggest that fibroblasts may play a role in pain. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an essential component of the innate immune system and activation of the receptor promotes pain. This study utilized a novel mouse model with dermal fibroblast specific expression of TLR4 on a TLR4-null background, which allows us to understand the sufficiency of skin fibroblast activation in pain development. Here we demonstrate that dermal fibroblast activation induces both acute inflammatory pain and hyperalgesic priming in both male and female mice. In vivo, activated dermal fibroblasts change cellular morphology in mice and humans. In vitro we observed pro-inflammatory cytokine production and activation of calcium signaling pathways. These data demonstrate that dermal fibroblast activation can cause acute pain and drive mechanisms involved in the transition to chronic pain.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

The disease is caused by the self-templated misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) into toxic species, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and death. We evaluated a novel epigenetic regulation approach using Zinc Finger Repressors (ZFRs) to ablate PrP expression at the transcriptional level. When delivered using adeno-associated virus (AAV), ZFRs potently and specifically reduced prion mRNA expression by >95% in vitro and to near undetectable levels within single neurons in vivo. In wildtype mice, ZFRs stably lowered neuronal PrP expression throughout the central nervous system for at least 17 months. In mice inoculated with misfolded PrP, AAV-ZFRs given at either early or late disease stages profoundly extended lifespan, significantly reduced PrP in the brain, and improved an array of molecular, histological, biomarker, and behavioral readouts. Finally, we delivered a ZFR targeting the human prion gene (PRNP) to cynomolgus monkeys using a novel blood-brain-barrier penetrant AAV capsid. Extensive bulk and single-cell assessments revealed widespread ZFR expression and PRNP repression in all 35 brain regions assessed, providing the first demonstration of epigenetic regulation across the nonhuman primate neuraxis following a single intravenous (IV) dose.

Recently, powerful methods have emerged that leverage third-generation sequencing to map protein-DNA interactions genome-wide. For example, Directed Methylation with Long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq) enables mapping of protein-DNA interactions along long, single chromatin fibers, including in highly repetitive genomic regions. However, DiMeLo-seq involves lossy centrifugation-based wash steps that limit its applicability to many sample types. To address this, we developed DiMeLo-cito, a single-tube, wash-free protocol that maximizes the yield and quality of genomic DNA obtained for long-read sequencing. This protocol enables the interrogation of genome-wide protein binding with as few as 100,000 cells and without the requirement of a nuclear envelope, enabling confident measurement of protein-DNA interactions during mitosis. Using this protocol, we detected strong binding of CTCF to mitotic chromosomes in diploid human cells, in contrast with earlier studies in karyotypically unstable cancer cell lines, suggesting that CTCF 'bookmarks' specific sites critical for maintaining genome architecture across cell divisions. By expanding the capabilities of DiMeLo-seq to a broader range of sample types, DiMeLo-cito can provide new insights into genome regulation and organization.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Nuclear RNAs (nucRNAs) have been proposed to be important regulators of such changes; however, the type, abundance, and functions of nucRNAs during neurodifferentiation remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrate multi-omic data generated in the frame of the Functional ANnoTation Of the Mammalian genome (FANTOM6) to chart 3D genome, RNA-DNA contactome, and transcriptome changes during in vitro differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells to neural stem cells and neurons. We find that most RNA-DNA contacts form between transcripts and their source gene; however, a group of intronic RNAs engages in chromatin contacts with distal loci on the same or on different chromosomes. We detect such trans-contacting intronic RNAs (TIRs) in all cell types profiled by FANTOM6, but most prominently in neurons, where TIRs are produced from highly expressed, neuron-specific, long (mean length: 400 kilobases, kb) protein-coding genes. In neurons, TIRs accumulate in the nucleus forming large clouds around their source loci, and they occasionally spread across the nucleus. TIRs engage in local and distal contacts with a set of genomic regions (named TIR-contacted regions or TIRCs) carrying much shorter (mean length: 30 kb) neuron-specific genes that become upregulated and move towards the nuclear center during neurodifferentiation, forming high-connectivity hubs. TIR source genes, and especially their introns, are strongly enriched in risk loci for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Notably, knockdown of a single TIR by antisense oligonucleotides leads to downregulation of multiple genes implicated in NDDs and of source genes of most other TIRs. We propose that TIRs orchestrate cell type-specific gene expression during neurodifferentiation and might be pathogenically linked to NDDs.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

These communities are shaped by root exudates including plant specialized metabolites. Benzoxazinoids are such secreted compounds of maize. Individual microbes differ in their ability to tolerate and metabolize antimicrobial benzoxazinoids. To investigate how these traits combine in a community, we designed two synthetic communities of maize root bacteria that share six common strains and differ in their ability to metabolize benzoxazinoids based on the seventh strain. We exposed both communities to the benzoxazinoid MBOA (6-methoxybenzoxazolin-2(3H)-one) and found that the metabolizing community did not degrade MBOA to its aminophenoxazinone, as observed for individual strains, but as a community they formed the corresponding acetamide. MBOA shaped differential compositions of both communities and increased the fraction of MBOA-tolerant strains. The benzoxazinoid metabolizing community showed a higher tolerance to MBOA and was able to utilize MBOA as their sole carbon source for growth. Hence, bacterial interaction results in alternative benzoxazinoid metabolization and increases community performance in presence of these antimicrobial compounds. Future work is needed to uncover the genetics of this metabolic interaction and ecological consequences for the bacterial community and the host plant.

ImportanceWe investigated how maize root bacteria - alone or in community - tolerate and metabolize antimicrobial compounds of their host plant. We found the capacity to metabolize such a compound to impact bacterial community size and structure and most importantly, to beneeit community eitness. We also found that interacting bacteria redirected the metabolisation of the antimicrobial compound to an alternative degradation product. Our work highlights the need to study the team work of microbes to uncover their community traits to ultimately understand the ecological consequences for the bacterial community and eventually the host plant.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

The evolutionary scheme for the development of this enzyme complex is poorly understood due to associated challenges like complications in delineating close homologs and diverse subunit ancestry. We used custom Hidden Markov Model profiles to examine the available prokaryotic genome space to trace the distribution pattern of fourteen core Nuo subunits of Complex I.

We show that mdx MuSCs have impaired migration and precocious differentiation through unbalanced symmetric divisions, driven by p38 and PI3K signalling pathways, in contrast to the p38-only dependence of healthy MuSCs. Cross-grafting shows that MuSC fate decisions are governed by intrinsic cues, whereas their migration behaviour is determined by the extracellular niche.

It remains unknown whether electrical stimulation of distinct pulvinar subregions affects the temporal, occipital, and parietal areas differently. To address this gap, we delivered single-pulse electrical stimulation to the pulvinar and measured the resulting brain stimulation evoked potentials in twelve patients undergoing stereotactic EEG for drug-resistant epilepsy. Brain stimulation evoked potentials were parameterized across the occipital, temporal and parietal cortex. Stimulation of the lateral pulvinar elicited significant brain stimulation evoked potentials in striate and extrastriate areas that diminish as stimulation shifts towards the medial pulvinar. Conversely, stimulation of the ventral aspect of the medial pulvinar produced significant lateral temporal evoked potentials, which diminish with lateral pulvinar stimulation. We also found that stimulation of the dorsomedial pulvinar evoked significant parietal responses with limited striate/extrastriate and lateral temporal responses. These results demonstrate that electrical stimulation of specific pulvinar subregions influences distinct occipital, parietal and lateral temporal areas. Selective targeting of pulvinar subregions to maximize seizure network engagement may be essential for individualized treatment of posterior quadrant and temporal epilepsies.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Here, we produced chromosome-scale genome assemblies of egg-laying shark species and comparatively investigated genome sequences and transcriptome profiles across diverse cartilaginous fishes. Sex chromosome identification, supported by cytogenetic experiments, elucidated the homology of X chromosomes between sharks and rays as well as an extensively degenerating Y chromosome harboring no male-specific genes. These sex chromosomes scarcely included orthologs of previously documented sex determining genes. Transcriptomic analyses combined with histology of embryonic gonads revealed female-biased expressions of X-linked genes including those implicated in TGF-{beta} and IGF signaling pathways, which are attributed to their incomplete dosage compensation.

Conjugative plasmids, a natural mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, have been repurposed to deliver toxic genetic cargo to recipient cells, showing promise as next-generation antimicrobial agents. However, the ecological risks posed by unintended gene transfer require robust biocontainment strategies. In this study, we developed inducible conjugative plasmids to solve these challenges. Utilizing an arabinose-inducible promoter, we evaluated 13 plasmids with single essential gene deletions, identifying trbC and trbF as strong candidates for stringent regulation. These plasmids demonstrated inducibility in both cis and trans configurations, with induction resulting in up to a 5-log increase in conjugation efficiency compared to uninduced conditions.

We therefore examined the genetic adaptations of Promethearchaeota after being frozen for >100 kyr by comparing metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Kolyma Lowland, Siberia, to MAGs from other marine and terrestrial sediments worldwide. We reconstructed 22 Promethearchaeota MAGs from 5 classes (Heimdallarchaeia, Gerdarchaeia, Lokiarchaeia, Helarachaeia and Thorarchaeia). Six MAGs from the intracellular DNA fraction were > 70% complete before and after DNA repair, and therefore likely represent living Promethearchaeota that have maintained high DNA integrity under cryogenic conditions through geological time. These 6 MAGs were also over 7 times more abundant than all other Promethearchaeota MAGs based on read recruitment. These permafrost Promethearchaeota MAGs are closely related to other non-permafrost Promethearchaeota lineages at the family or genus level and share metabolic potential and genes for DNA and protein repair with them. This suggests that the ability to survive for >100 kyr in permafrost is a trait that is widespread within the Promethearchaeota. No genes were more prevalent in our permafrost MAGs compared to Promethearchaeota MAGs from other environments. The lack of detectable genetic change since these groups were frozen is consistent with the predicted state of inactivity. Furthermore, although DNA repair mechanisms were present in the Promethearchaeota/Eukaryote lineage before the eukaryotic split, Promethearchaeota protein repair mechanisms emerged after the split, suggesting that adaptations to long term dormancy, or aeonophily, may set modern Promethearchaeota apart from eukaryotes. Collectively, our study expands the known habitat range of many subgroups of Promethearchaeota to ancient marine permafrost and suggests they may have extraordinary long-term survivability under cryogenic conditions through geological time.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

We used comparative chromatin and transcriptional profiling of neural progenitor cells isolated from gorilla, chimpanzee and human cerebral organoids to identify cis-regulatory elements that have gained activity in humans. Focusing specifically on bRG, we discovered that morphoregulatory enhancer activity and gene expression signatures distinguish human bRG from other great apes. Functional analysis of the morphoregulatory genes FAM107A and CNGA3 in human organoids revealed that these genes are required for the morphological complexity of human bRG.

Regulation of these processes by insulin signalling depends on changes in protein localisation. However, the extent of insulin-stimulated changes to the adipocyte spatial proteome, and the importance of these in the cellular insulin response, is unknown. Here, we use subcellular proteomics approaches to map acute insulin-stimulated protein in adipocytes on a cell-wide scale. These data revealed extensive insulin-regulated protein redistribution, with hundreds of novel insulin-responsive proteins. These included the uncharacterised protein C3ORF18, which redistributed to the PM in response to insulin. Studies in C3ORF18-depleted adipocytes suggest this protein is required for maximal insulin signalling. Overall, our data highlight the scale of protein relocalisation in the adipocyte insulin response, and provide an accessible resource to inform further studies into how changes in protein localisation contribute to cellular insulin responses.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Even slight head shifts from the initial calibration position can introduce drift in eye tracking data, leading to substantial gaze inaccuracies. To address this, we introduce Motion-Corrected Eye Tracking (MoCET), a novel approach that corrects drift using head motion parameters derived from the preprocessing of fMRI data. MoCET requires no additional hardware and can be applied retrospectively to existing datasets. We show that it outperforms traditional detrending methods with respect to accuracy of gaze estimation and offers higher spatial and temporal precision compared to MR-based eye tracking approaches. By overcoming a key limitation in integrating eye tracking with fMRI, MoCET facilitates investigations of naturalistic vision and cognition in fMRI research.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

This study used the model bryophyte Physcomitrium patens to uncover such genes and employed CRISPR-based screening to identify novel cell division genes in plants.
C_LIO_LICo-expression data from known mitotic genes were used to create a pool of 216 candidate genes, which were then targeted in CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Frameshift mutants with division defects were characterized using high-resolution imaging of mitosis and gene tagging with fluorophores for localization analysis.
C_LIO_LIThree novel gene families--CYR (Cytokinesis-Related), LACH (Lagging Chromosome), and SpinMi (Spindle and Phragmoplast Midzone)--were identified. CYR genes were linked to cytokinesis defects, LACH was essential for chromosome segregation, and SpinMi localized to the spindle and phragmoplast midzone. Notably, none of these gene families had homologs in algae, suggesting their emergence during land colonization.
C_LIO_LIOur findings provide a framework for combining co-expression analysis with targeted screening to identify genes associated with specific cellular processes, in this case, cell division. Beyond characterizing three novel gene families, this study also offers insights into evolutionary changes in the plant cell division machinery.

Although advancements in whole genome sequencing (WGS) have improved surveillance and outbreak investigations, traditional single-colony sequencing methods overlook within-host diversity, potentially underestimating the complexity of infections. This study explores the genome-wide diversity of Salmonella strains recovered from stool samples of eight patients, with up to 20 isolates analysed per sample.

A total of 156 Salmonella enterica isolates were recovered. All isolates from individual patients displayed consistent serovars and sequence types. Despite the serotype consistency, microevolution was observed in S. Java ST149 and S. Java ST43, with SNP analyses revealing higher diversity (13 and 5 SNP differences, respectively) compared to the clonal populations of other serovars. Phylogenetic analysis of S. Java ST149 isolates from Patient 2 revealed distinct branching, driven by mutations in genes such as secY and cnoX, while S. Java ST43 isolates from Patient 1 displayed multiple clades with notable SNPs affecting transcriptional regulators.

Genome structure (GS) analyses using hybrid assemblies identified uniform GS1.0 across all isolates. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling revealed the presence of multidrug efflux pump genes (mdsA and mdsB) in all isolates. However, S. Typhimurium isolates from Patient 4 exhibited additional AMR genes, including sul2, aph(3)-Ib, and blaTEM-1, associated with an 8.7 kb resistance region. A single isolate from Patient 4 lacked these additional genes due to the deletion of a [~]19 kb genomic region, highlighting structural variation as a driver of phenotypic differences.

These findings emphasise the genetic diversity of Salmonella within hosts, particularly in serovars such as S. Java, and underscore the limitations of single-colony sequencing in capturing this complexity. The study highlights the utility of hybrid sequencing strategies for comprehensive analysis of genome variation, offering valuable insights into transmission dynamics, antimicrobial resistance, and evolutionary processes in Salmonella.

Impact statementThis study provides a transformative perspective on Salmonella genomics, uncovering the significant within-host diversity of Salmonella populations through the analysis of multiple single-colony isolates. By leveraging hybrid sequencing technologies, we reveal critical insights into the microevolution of Salmonella during infection, capturing genome-wide variation at both single nucleotide and chromosomal scales. Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of traditional single-colony sequencing in detecting within-host diversity, particularly in genetically diverse serovars such as S. Java ST149.

The identification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants and structural genomic variation demonstrates the dynamic nature of Salmonella genomes, offering crucial implications for clinical management and public health surveillance. Importantly, we show that within-host diversity may influence epidemiological interpretations, particularly in outbreak investigations and source attribution, where genetic differences between isolates can mask deeper transmission links.

While molecular dynamics (MD) is the foundation method for simulating biomolecular dynamics, it is computationally expensive. Recently, deep learning models trained on MD have made progress in generating structural ensembles at reduced cost. However, they remain limited in modeling atomistic details and, crucially, incorporating the effect of environmental factors. Here, we present aSAM (atomistic structural autoencoder model), a latent diffusion model trained on MD to generate heavy atom protein ensembles. Unlike most methods, aSAM models atoms in a latent space, greatly facilitating accurate sampling of side chain and backbone torsion angle distributions. Additionally, we extended aSAM into the first reported transferable generator conditioned on temperature, named aSAMt. Trained on the large and open mdCATH dataset, aSAMt captures temperature-dependent ensemble properties and demonstrates generalization beyond training temperatures. By comparing aSAMt ensembles to long MD simulations of fast folding proteins, we find that high-temperature training enhances the ability of deep generators to explore energy landscapes. Finally, we also show that our MD-based aSAMt can already capture experimentally observed thermal behavior of proteins. Our work is a step towards generalizable ensemble generation to complement physics-based approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Their assembly occurs in ER regions enriched with seipin which, through its homooligomeric ring-like structure, facilitates neutral lipid nucleation. In yeast, seipin (Sei1) partners with Ldb16, Ldo45 (yeast homologue of human LDAF1) and Ldo16, which regulate LD formation and consumption. How the molecular architecture of the yeast seipin complex and its interaction with regulatory proteins adapt to different metabolic conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that multiple Ldb16 regions contribute differently to recruiting Ldo45 and Ldo16 to the seipin complex. Using an in-vivo site-specific photo-crosslinking approach, we further show that Ldo45 resides at the center of the seipin ring both in the absence and presence of neutral lipids. Interestingly, neutral lipid synthesis leads to the recruitment of Ldo45 but not Ldo16 to the complex. Our findings suggest that the seipin complex serves as a pre-assembled scaffold for lipid storage that can be remodeled in response to increased neutral lipid availability.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

However, the choice of an optimal method remains debated due to challenges in statistical power differences across ancestral groups and approaches to account for population structure. Two primary strategies exist: (1) Pooled analysis, which combines individuals from all genetic backgrounds into a single dataset while adjusting for population stratification using principal components, increasing the sample size and statistical power but requiring careful control of population stratification. (2) Meta-analysis, which performs ancestry-group-specific GWAS and subsequently combines summary statistics, potentially capturing fine-scale population structure, but facing limitations in handling admixed individuals. Using large-scale simulations with varying sample sizes and ancestry compositions, we compare these methods alongside real data analyses of eight continuous and five binary traits from the UK Biobank (N{approx}324,000) and All of Us Research Program (N{approx}207,000). Our results demonstrate that pooled analysis generally exhibits better statistical power while effectively adjusting for population stratification.

Conjugative transfer between gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria exemplifies amazing capability of this mechanism to mobilize DNA across cells that are evolutionarily distant and structurally distinct. While such inter-gram conjugations have been reported in many studies, none has analyzed the general principles and limitations of this type of transfer. Here, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess overall conjugative transfer success and relevant parameter affecting conjugation efficiency, focusing on conjugation from gram-negative Escherichia coli to gram-positive bacteria. We found 31 studies comprising 512 measurements. Conjugative transfer from E.coli to gram positive bacteria is significantly less efficient than from E.coli to E.coli or E.coli to other gram-negative bacteria. Still, under well-optimized conditions and in certain recipient strains, E.coli-to-gram positive conjugation could be surprisingly efficient, with conjugation efficiency within 1-2 orders of magnitudes from E.coli-to-E.coli conjugation. We identified several strategies that dramatically improved conjugation efficiency such as changing methylation pattern of plasmid or optimizing cation in conjugation environment. Further exploration of recipient strains, conjugation machineries and optimization strategies would allow us to develop even more versatile DNA delivery tools for engineering undomesticated microbes.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

These two ripple profiles recruit neurons differently. Radsink ripples integrate recent motifs of waking coactivity, combining superficial and deep CA1 principal cells into denser, higher-dimensional patterns that undergo hour-long stable reactivation. In contrast, LMsink ripples contain core motifs of prior coactivity, engaging deep cells into sparser, lower-dimensional patterns that undergo a reactivation drift, gradually updating their pre-structured content for recent wakefulness.

We developed a massively parallel dual reporter assay that enables simultaneous assessment of the intrinsic promoter and enhancer potential exerted by the same sequence. Parallel quantification for thousands of elements reveals that canonical human promoters and enhancers can act as both promoters and enhancers under the same contexts, and that promoter activity may be necessary but not sufficient for enhancer function. We find that regulatory potential is intrinsic to element sequences, irrespective of downstream features typically associated with distinct element classes. Perturbations to element transcription factor binding motifs lead to disruptions in both activities, implicating a shared syntax for the two regulatory functions. Combinations of elements with different minimal promoters reveal reciprocal activity modulation between associated elements and a strong positive correlation between promoter and enhancer functions imply a bidirectional feedback loop used to maintain environments of high transcriptional activity.

G. rufa is primarily known for its role in ichthyotherapy, in which it helps remove keratinized skin from human hands and feet. However, in recent years, its high-temperature tolerance has attracted attention owing to its potential use as a model for human disease research, including infectious diseases and cancer xenograft models. Despite this interest, the genomic basis underlying high-temperature tolerance remains largely unexplored, primarily because of the limited availability of genomic resources, which hinders its development as an experimental model. In the present study, a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of G. rufa was generated using a combination of PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing and Hi-C technology. We generated a chromosome-level genome assembly with 25 chromosomes, 1.38 Gb in total length, and scaffold N50 of 49.3 Mb. Approximately 59% of the genome comprises repetitive elements, with DNA and LTR elements being particularly abundant. In total, 27,352 protein-coding genes were annotated, of which 26,900 genes (98.3%) were functionally annotated. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) benchmark for genome assembly and gene annotation demonstrated 94.5% and 94.7% of complete BUSCOs, respectively. We identified two heat shock transcription factor (HSF) and 239 heat shock protein (HSP)-related genes. Heat shock elements, which are HSF-binding motifs, were present within 3 kb upstream of 944 genes, with statistically significant enrichment of HSP-related genes in this set. Furthermore, molecular phylogenetic analysis and whole-genome comparisons revealed that G. rufa is evolutionarily closely related to species in the Labeoninae subfamily of the Cyprinidae family. This chromosome-level reference genome provides a valuable resource for future research aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying high-temperature tolerance in G. rufa and establishing it as a model organism for human biomedical studies.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Here, we report that Drosophila oogenesis requires the Integrator, NEXT, and nuclear exosome complexes. Depletion of Integrator, NEXT, or nuclear exosome components in Drosophila female germ cells causes infertility and accumulation of 3' extended snRNAs, promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and cryptic transcripts. Our data highlight the essential role of nuclear RNA degradation and processing in Drosophila oogenesis and provide a catalog of RNAs whose nuclear levels are regulated by these three complexes. We propose that Integrator, NEXT, and the nuclear exosome support oogenesis by ensuring that inappropriate transcription does not overwhelm the limited supply of proteins that bind, process, and traffic RNA.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

In contrast to well-perfused tissues, nutrient deficits in tumors perturb cellular metabolic activity, which imposes metabolic constraints on cancer cells. The metabolic constraints created by the tumor microenvironment can lead to vulnerabilities in cancers. Identifying the metabolic constraints of the tumor microenvironment and the vulnerabilities that arise in cancers can provide new insight into tumor biology and identify promising antineoplastic targets. To identify how the microenvironment constrains the metabolism of pancreatic tumors, we challenged pancreatic cancer cells with microenvironmental nutrient levels and analyzed changes in cell metabolism. We found that arginine limitation in pancreatic tumors perturbs saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis by suppressing the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1. Synthesis of these fatty acids is critical for maintaining a balance of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes. As a consequence of microenvironmental constraints on fatty acid synthesis, pancreatic cancer cells and tumors are unable to maintain lipid homeostasis when exposed to polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to cell death by ferroptosis. In sum, arginine restriction in the tumor microenvironment constrains lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancers, which renders these tumors vulnerable to polyunsaturated-enriched fat sources.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

However, batch effects, arising from non-biological variations in sample collection, processing, sequencing platforms, or experimental protocols, can obscure biological signals, hinder data integration, and impact downstream analyses. Despite their critical impact, batch effects in ST datasets remain poorly defined and insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we propose a framework to categorize and define batch effects in ST and systematically evaluate the performance of ST methods with batch effect correction capabilities. Results: We categorized batch effects in ST into four types based on their sources: (1) Inter-slice, (2) Inter-sample, (3) Cross-protocol/platform, and (4) Intra-slice. Seven ST integration methods--DeepST, STAligner, GraphST, STitch3D, PRECAST, spatiAlign, and SPIRAL--were evaluated on benchmark datasets from human and mouse tissues. Using metrics such as graph connectivity, kBET, ASW, and iLISI, we assessed both the preservation of biological neighborhoods and the effectiveness of these methods in batch correction. Additionally, we applied STAligner for downstream analysis to compare results before and after batch correction, further highlighting the importance of batch effect correction in ST analysis. Conclusion: No single method is universally optimal. GraphST, PRECAST, SPIRAL, and STAligner performed well for same-platform integration, whereas SPIRAL and STAligner excelled in cross-platform settings. These findings highlight the need for robust and generalizable ST approaches with effective batch correction capabilities to facilitate the integration of multi-platform ST datasets in future research.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Here we tracked changes in vaginal microbiota during four key menstrual cycle phases in 61 healthy Italian women from the Women4Health cohort. The microbiota was primarily composed of Lactobacillus, with L. iners being the most abundant. Noteworthy, the high abundance of L. iners contrasts with previous studies in European populations, challenging its proposed pathogenic role, and suggesting distinct microbiota profiles within Europe. Individual microbiotas were generally stable, but beta diversity was higher during the follicular phase. Only 11 women exhibited compositional shifts and those mostly occurred between follicular and ovulatory phases. Finally, among the hormones evaluated, 17-beta estradiol had the largest impact on taxa abundance variations. Our study highlights specific features of the Italian population and points to the resilience of the vaginal microbiota to physiological hormonal changes.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Numerous approaches exist to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees by considering different biological data, such as DNA sequence, protein sequence, protein-protein interaction graph, etc. However, each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Till date, no existing method guarantees to determine true phylogenetic trees all the times. Various studies identified distinct branch length configurations where the existing methods are inefficient to infer the correct tree topologies.
C_LIO_LIHere, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model, DeePhy, to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees from the unaligned sequences. The sequences are repre- sented on a two-dimensional coordinate plane by utilizing a biological semantics-based map- ping. Additionally, to assess the robustness of a method, here we also propose a novel boot- strapping technique to generate replicas from the unaligned sequences. We train the model on the triplet sequences, where the output is a triplet tree topology.
C_LIO_LIWe show that the well-trained DeePhy outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in inferring triplet tree topology. We experiment DeePhy on data simulated under numerous critical conditions and various branch length configurations. We conduct the McNemar test for comparing the performance of DeePhy and the state-of-the-art methods. The results exhibit that DeePhy is significantly more accurate and remarkably robust in determining the triplet tree topologies for most of the cases than that of the conventional methods. Again, various comparison metrics show that DeePhy also outperforms the conventional methods in inferring trees. Finally, to analyze the performance of DeePhy on real biological dataset, we apply it on Gadiformes dataset. Reassuringly, DeePhy reconstructs the phylogenetic tree from real biological data with known or widely accepted topologies.
C_LIO_LIAlthough various practical challenges still need to be taken care of, the outcomes of our study suggest that the deep learning approaches be a successful endeavour in inferring the accurate phylogenetic trees.

While deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have demonstrated hierarchical feature extraction similar to biological systems (DiCarlo and Cox, 2007; Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016), recent findings reveal a growing discrepancy: DCNNs with higher object categorization accuracy paradoxically show worse performance at predicting neural responses (Xu and Vaziri-Pashkam, 2021; Linsley et al., 2023). Using a large-scale human electroencephalography (EEG) dataset (n=10, 82,160 trials), we investigate whether this discrepancy arises because human neural EEG signals predominantly reflect scene segmentation processes rather than high-level, category-specific object representations. We trained DCNNs to perform object recognition using visual diets (~1 million training images across 292 object categories) with systematically varying scene segmentation demands: objects-only (pre-segmented), background-silhouette (explicit boundaries), original/background-only images (requiring full segmentation). Despite substantial differences in categorization accuracy (27-53%), all trained models showed remarkably uniform encoding performance, with peak correlations with neural data at ~0.1s post-stimulus. Layer-wise analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between categorization accuracy and encoding performance, with earlier network layers better predicting EEG responses than deeper layers specialized for object categorization. This dissociation suggests that EEG signals primarily reflect fundamental scene parsing mechanisms rather than object-specific representations, explaining the growing discrepancy between DCNNs increasing categorization performance but deteriorating neural prediction performance.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

While peptides presented to CD4+ T cells via major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) are traditionally thought to be derived from extracellular sources that are processed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) through the classical exogenous pathway, the precise mechanisms of mRNA-LNP vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell priming remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of alternative, endogenous antigen presentation pathways in inducing CD4+ T cell responses to mRNA-LNP vaccines. APCs treated with mRNA-LNP vaccines were consistently superior in activating T cells under conditions of endogenous, rather than exogenous, presentation. Immunization with an mRNA-LNP vaccine that excludes antigen expression in APCs resulted in lower antigen-specific CD4+ T cell, T follicular helper cell, and antibody responses than mice receiving control vaccine. In contrast, depletion of vaccine antigen from exogenous sources such as muscle cells resulted in little to no reduction in antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.

The limitations of current antifungal therapies due to toxicity and the emergence of resistance highlight the need for novel treatment strategies and targets. C. neoformans has an intron-rich genome, and pre-mRNA splicing is required for expression of the vast majority of its genes. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a human splicing inhibitor, pladienolide B (PladB), as an antifungal against C. neoformans. PladB inhibited growth of C. neoformans in liquid culture and spore germination. The potency of PladB could be increased by simultaneous treatment with either FK506 or clorgyline. This combination treatment resulted in significant reductions in fungal growth and prevented spore germination. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PladB inhibits splicing in C. neoformans and results in wide-spread intron retention. In combination with FK506, this resulted in down-regulation of or intron-retention in transcripts from processes vital for cellular growth including translation, transcription, and RNA processing. Together, these results suggest that targeting RNA splicing pathways could be a promising antifungal strategy and that the effectiveness of splicing inhibitors as antifungals can be increased by co-administering drugs such as FK506.

IMPORTANCEFungal infections, like those caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, can turn deadly for many patients. New treatments and therapeutic targets are needed to combat these pathogens. One potential target is the pre-mRNA processing pathway which is required for expression of nearly all protein-coding genes in C. neoformans. We have determined that a pre-mRNA splicing inhibitor can inhibit both C. neoformans growth and germination and that the potency of this drug can be increased when used in combination with other molecules. This work provides evidence that targeting steps in pre-mRNA processing may be an effective antifungal strategy and avenue for development of new medicines.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Metabolic processes in the human brain that allow for rapid expansion, but contribute to vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders, remain largely unexplored. We performed a variety of metabolic assays in primary tissue and stem cell derived cortical organoids and observed dynamic changes in core metabolic functions, including an unexpected increase in glycolysis during late neurogenesis. By depleting glucose levels in cortical organoids, we increased outer radial glia, astrocytes, and inhibitory neurons. We found the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was impacted in these experiments and leveraged pharmacological and genetic manipulations to recapitulate these radial glia cell fate changes. These data identify a new role for the PPP in modulating radial glia cell fate specification and generate a resource for future exploration of additional metabolic pathways in human cortical development.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Endosomal acidification is driven by V-ATPase which pumps protons (H+) into the lumen. The driving force for H+ is maintained by the import of chloride (Cl-) which is mediated by intracellular CLC transporters. We have recently identified the Proton-Activated Chloride (PAC) channel as a negative regulator of endosomal acidification. PAC responds to low pH and releases Cl- from the lumen to prevent endosomal hyperacidification. However, its role in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry remains unexplored. Here, we show that overexpressing the PAC channel in ACE2 expressing HEK 293T cells markedly inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated viral entry. Several lines of evidence suggest that this effect was due to the suppression of the endosomal entry pathway. First, the abilities of PAC to regulate endosomal acidification and inhibit pseudoviral entry were both dependent on its endosomal localization and channel activity. Second, the inhibitory effect on viral entry was similar to the suppression mediated by E64-d, a cathepsin inhibitor, while no major additive effect for both treatments was observed. Third, this inhibition was also attenuated in cells expressing TMPRSS2, which provides the alternative entry pathway through cell surface. Importantly, PAC overexpression also inhibited the number and size of plaques formed by two live SARS-CoV-2 isolates (B.1 and Omicron XBB.1.16) in Vero E6 cells. Altogether, our data indicates that PAC plays a vital role in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and identifies this endosomal channel as a potential novel target against the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, which rely on the endosomal pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Although structural variants (SVs) in the non-coding region downstream of FOXG1 have been reported in 38 individuals with similar characteristics, the regulatory pathomechanisms remain unknown.

We identified a de novo non-coding deletion in an individual with FOXG1 syndrome-like disorder, allowing us to delineate a [~]124 kb commonly affected regulatory region (CARR). By integrating epigenomics data, 3D chromatin interaction profiles (Hi-C, UMI-4C), and in vivo enhancer assays in zebrafish, we uncovered multiple regulatory elements within this CARR, including a neuronal enhancer cluster and a conserved boundary of the FOXG1-containing topologically associating domain (TAD). Hi-C analysis on case lymphoblastoid cells revealed increased interactions with the adjacent TAD. Moreover, sequential UMI-4C and CUT&RUN assays during neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation demonstrated dynamic activation of, and interaction with the enhancer cluster. Finally, CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the enhancer cluster and TAD boundary in NPCs resulted in decreased FOXG1 transcription.

We identified and characterized enhancer and architectural elements essential for proper FOXG1 transcription.

However, conventional probes for typical reporter enzymes are insufficiently bioorthogonal, resulting in high background signals in non-target tissues. We screened a library of HMRef (rhodol derivative)-based fluorescence probes bearing various sugar moieties, and discovered that HMRef-{beta}-D-fucose is bioorthogonal in mammalian systems, but is activated by a metagenomic glycosidase, Td2F2. Directed evolution generated a mutant with a kcat/Km value for HMRef-{beta}-D-fucose of 3.3 x 105/M/sec, 7.3 times higher than that of wild-type Td2F2 and comparable to that of {beta}-galactosidase (LacZ) with a corresponding probe.

These morphologies, characterised by a high topological genus, can be visualised as spherical double membranes connected by neck-like structures. The necks are often occupied by specific biomolecular complexes, such as the nuclear pore complex, which divide the space into three distinct compartments. Understanding how the size of these necks responds to pressure gradients is fundamentally important for unravelling the influence of mechanical stimuli on traffic control through the necks, for example, in nuclear mechanosensing. In this work, we use computer simulations and theoretical analysis to investigate how neck size responds to variations in pressure or tension. Our findings reveal a two-phase behaviour: below a certain threshold, necks constrict as the pressure gradient increases, while above that threshold, they dilate. This response stems from the pure membrane's mechanics and depends on the magnitude of the pressure gradient, the initial diameter of the neck and the membrane bending rigidity. We also provide a simple equation that links the threshold tension, the neck diameter and the bending rigidity, offering a useful tool to quickly assess different scenarios. Our results furthermore show that protein complexes in the neck partially counteract both constriction and dilation, stabilising neck size while preserving the same two-phase response to membrane tension. These findings uncover a novel, previously overlooked membrane property with implications for organelle shape and function.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Using a case-control design involving 538 children, we obtained dental plaque microbiome profiles and genetic variants across 55 candidate genes through next-generation sequencing. Our association analysis for taste genetics and ECC outcome used the socioeconomic factor index (SEFI) and rural-urban status as confounders. We observed a few taste gene variants associated with ECC and microbial diversity. However, no specific association was observed between the variants and cariogenic species. Furthermore, our analysis indicated that Streptococcus mutans is a partial mediator between these genetic variants and ECC outcomes. Machine learning models integrating microbiome, genetics, and covariates achieved robust ECC vs. caries-free classification (AUROC = 0.96), with Streptococcus mutans, rural-urban status, a bitter taste receptor variant, Candida dubliniensis, and SEFI as the top ECC-associated factors.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects.

Its therapeutic application reduces but does not abolish the progression of COVID-19 in humans. Here we report a strong synergy of Nirmatrelvir with inhibitors of the ER chaperone GRP78 (HSPA5, BiP). Combining Nirmatrelvir with the GRP78-antagonizing drug candidate HA15 strongly inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, to a far greater extent than either drug alone, as observed by diminished cytopathic effect, levels of detectable virus RNA, TCID50 titers, accumulation of the non-structural protein 3 (NSP3), as well as Spike and N proteins. The original SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as an Omicron variant were similarly susceptible towards the drug combination. Other GRP78 inhibitors or siRNAs targeting GRP78 also fortified the antiviral effect of Nirmatrelvir. In a hamster model of COVID-19, the combination of Nirmatrelvir with HA15 alleviated pneumonia-induced pulmonary atelectasis more effectively than the single drugs. In conclusion, inhibition of the virus Main protease and cellular GRP78 cooperatively diminishes virus replication and may improve COVID-19 therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

In heterodichogamy, two hermaphroditic morphs exploit distinct temporal reproductive niches by alternating phases of male and female flowering, promoting disassortative mating. This system is widespread within Juglandaceae, and known to be controlled by ancient balanced polymorphisms in walnuts (Juglans) and hickories (Carya). Here we identify distinct inheritance mechanisms controlling heterodichogamy in two separate Juglandaceae genera, the wingnuts (Pterocarya and Cyclocarya). We first document the occurrence of heterodichogamy in Pterocarya and map its genomic basis to haplotypes overlapping a single candidate gene in the FANTASTIC FOUR superfamily (GFAFL). These haplotypes segregate throughout the entire genus and the dominant haplotype controls female-first flowering. We show heterodichogamy in the sister genus Cyclocarya is associated with a distinct pair of ancient haplotypes at the same locus in both diploids and tetraploids, but with a dominant allele controlling male-first flowering. We infer a well-resolved fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Juglandaceae and date the divergence of the Pterocarya and Cyclocarya haplotypes to 51 and 44 million years ago, more recent than the divergence of these genera. In Pterocarya female-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific suppression of the recessive copy of GFAFL during early male flower development. In Cyclocarya male-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific activation of the recessive copy of GFAFL during male flower development, while the dominant copy itself shows higher expression in female flowers. We propose a model for the evolution of reciprocal sex matching in heterodichogamy through the combination of cis-regulatory divergence and allelic interactions involving  fast and  slow alleles at a single gene regulating flowering time. The non-independent expression of alleles in both systems is reminiscent of trans-sensing phenomena in other systems and suggests a mechanism mediated by DNA homology or an RNA intermediary. Notably, the dominant haplotypes in both genera show parallel architecture with a hemizygous region containing tandem duplicates of the same 1 kb motif downstream of the transcribed region of GFAFL which may be linked with such a mechanism. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of heterodichogamy and contribute to an emerging view that diverse genetic pathways can be co-opted during its evolution and facilitate turnover in its genetic control.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Using gradient boosting on tree features, we address the largely unsolved challenge of scoring quantification accuracy, as opposed to precision. Our method clusters peptides with similar quantitative behavior, providing a new approach to the protein grouping problem and enabling identification of regulated proteoforms directly from bottom-up data. Combined with deep learning classification, we infer phosphopeptides from proteome data alone, validating our findings with EGFR stimulation data.

Experimental evidence indicates that spike mutations, particularly the early D614G variant, alter the rate of this conformational shift, potentially increasing viral infectivity. To investigate how mutations reshape the conformational landscape, we conducted extensive weighted ensemble simulations of the Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 spike strains along the RBD opening pathway. We observe that Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 spike RBDs open differently, with Omicron BA.1 following a more direct opening profile until it reaches a ""super-open"" state wherein it begins to ""peel"", suggesting increased S1 flexibility. Via dynamical network analysis, we identified two allosteric communication networks uniting all S1 domains: the established N2R linker and a newly discovered anti-parallel R2N linker. In Delta and Omicron BA.1 variant spikes, RBD opening is facilitated by both linkers, while the Ancestral strain relies predominantly on the N2R linker. In the ancestral spike, the D614-K854 salt bridge impedes allosteric communication through the R2N linker, whereas the loss of this salt bridge in all subsequent VOCs alleviates local frustration and, we believe, accelerates RBD opening. Hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry experiments validate these altered dynamics in the D614 region across Ancestral, D614G, and Omicron BA.1 spikes. This study unveils a  hidden allosteric network, connecting the NTD to the RBD via the 614-proximal region, and the D614G mutation reshapes the fitness landscape of these critical viral glycoproteins.

Significance StatementOur work reveals how the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reshapes its internal communication pathways and speeds up receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, providing mechanistic insight into the evolution and enhanced infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Calcium imaging is such a key method which, however, records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise primarily from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of the calcium indicator, but also depend on the methods for calcium signal analysis. Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, due to their fast rise times, GCaMP8 indicators support shorter closed-loop latencies for real-time detection of neuronal activity. Together, our study provides demonstrations, tools, and guidelines to optimally process and quantitatively interpret calcium signals obtained with GCaMP8.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

The tomato sensor NLR Prf guards the Pto kinase from AvrPto and AvrPtoB effector perturbation and activates the downstream helpers NRC2 and NRC3. Prf is conserved across the Solanaceae and its ortholog in the model species Nicotiana benthamiana is also required for detection of AvrPto/AvrPtoB function on Pto. A recent study reported that cell death induction after transient expression of an autoactive mutant of tomato NRC3 is abolished upon RNAi silencing of Prf in N. benthamiana. Here we generated loss-of-function prf mutants in N. benthamiana and demonstrate that autoactive mutants of eight canonical tomato NRCs (NRC0, NRC1, NRC2, NRC3, NRC4a, NRC4b, NRC6, and NRC7) still induce hypersensitive cell death when expressed transiently in the prf mutant background. Autoactive tomato NRCs also triggered cell death when expressed in lettuce (Lactuca sativa), an Asteraceae plant that does not have a Prf ortholog.

When we connect causal links between events separated in time, we often experience a sudden feeling of ""aha!"", or a moment of insight. What cognitive and neural processes underlie these moments of understanding? We hypothesized that narrative insight accompanies retrieving causally related past events in memory and updating the current event representation. To test this, we designed an fMRI study in which participants watched a TV episode that was cut into multiple events and presented in temporally scrambled orders. Participants pressed an ""aha"" button whenever they understood something new and verbally explained why they pressed in those moments at the end of each run. Supporting our prediction, more than 40% of insights included the retrieval of past events that were causally related to the current event. Neural patterns representing causally related past events were reinstated in cortical areas. This neural reinstatement drove sudden shifts in cortical representation patterns ~2 s prior to aha button presses, reflecting an update in situational representation at moments of insight. Moreover, distributed areas in the brain represented causally related events with similar neural patterns, beyond their shared semantic or perceptual features. Together, the study suggests that we comprehend events by reinstating causally related past events via shared neural patterns, followed by updating neural patterns at moments of insight.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Here we combine in vivo and in vitro single-molecule imaging to dissect the role of DBD-flanking regions (DFRs) of the mammalian Sox2 and Sox17 TFs in searching for their binding sites. We demonstrate that the DFRSox2 dramatically enhances the search efficiency of Sox2 as compared to the negatively-charged DFRSox17. An enhanced search on naked DNA is primarily mediated by an increase in target recognition rate during 1D sliding. In contrast, target site recognition within nucleosomal DNA is mainly enhanced by increased nonspecific interactions with nucleosomes, facilitating binding to closed chromatin and reinforcing pioneering activity. These findings provide critical insights into the biophysical mechanisms governing TF target search on the chromatinized genome.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Using whole-brain activity and axonal projection mappings, we identified projectome subtypes of LCNA neurons, which are differentially recruited by single versus consecutive aversive social experiences.

Despite these successes, cryo-EM sample preparation remains a major bottleneck for routinely achieving high-resolution structures through single particle analysis. Challenges such as inconsistent ice thicknesses, air-water interface interactions and preferred particle orientation persist. Here, we introduce a blot-free vitrification method that uses free-standing surfactant-stabilised foam films to address some of these issues. The method achieves uniform ice thicknesses, enables thickness control of the foam film prior to vitrification, and for some specimens enhances orientation distribution efficiency. Furthermore, it reduces particle adsorption to carbon foil on the specimen support. The method simplifies cryo-EM specimen preparation, offering improved control over ice thickness and particle orientation, to help streamline and accelerate structure determination.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies and genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggests the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum dysfunction in the pathophysiology of AN. However, identifying the causal role of circuit-specific genes in the development of AN-like phenotype remains challenging and requires the combination of novel molecular tools and preclinical models. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model recapitulates many aspects of the behavioural phenotypes of AN in humans and we have previously demonstrated that suppressing neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) circuit prevented pathological weight loss in ABA rats. Here, we used a novel viral-based translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique to identify transcriptional changes within this neural pathway associated with susceptibility to ABA in female rats. We reveal 1424 differentially expressed genes between Susceptible and Resistant rats, highlighting important transcriptional changes associated with ABA within this pathway. The changes observed were independent of current calorie deficit and associated with metabolic, mitochondrial and neural functions. Further, we show that genes upregulated in Resistant rats were involved in mitochondrial function, while downregulated genes were associated with cytoskeletal, postsynaptic and axonal functions, supporting the hypothesis that hyperexcitability of cortico-striatal circuit function is a critical mediator of pathological weight loss in ABA. These findings provide novel insights into circuit-specific gene expression patterns that may contribute to susceptibility to developing AN in humans and highlight potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment.

FindingsNeuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 56.5% (48/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy, a comparable rate to other AGA-associated neuropathies. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms.

InterpretationOur findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1742076499972

Borrelia is known to disseminate through organs, including the skin, joints, spinal cord, bladder, and heart, leading to Lyme arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme carditis. While previous studies have investigated the impact of LD on pregnancy in both mice and humans and have found the presence of B. burgdorferi in the uterus of mice, we studied the impact of LD on the non-pregnant female reproductive tract. We use a mouse model for LD and find an ongoing and severe infection of the reproductive tract of female mice, which persists up to 15-months post-inoculation. This infection results in uterine glandular cysts and endometrial hyperplasia as well as vaginal epithelial thickening, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell epithelial infiltration, and epithelial desquamation into the vaginal lumen. Strikingly, we find that age has an impact on the extent of gynecologic pathology such that aged female mice (1-year old) that are reproductively senescent have more gynecologic pathology with infection compared to young mice (15-weeks old) when infected for the same length of time. Using large-scale electronic healthcare record data, we report that LD additionally results in increased infection-associated risk of menorrhagia (1.5-fold), miscarriage (1.62-fold), uterine fibroids (1.42-fold), and endometriosis (1.93-fold). Underreporting of gynecological outcomes is pervasive throughout many different infectious diseases, and LD-associated gynecological pathologies may have been similarly underappreciated in the field. This work suggests that further study of the female reproductive tract and the effects of B. burgdorferi infection therein will help clarify and expand the knowledge of myriad LD outcomes.

To go much beyond this number, smaller and simpler genetic systems are needed to avoid significant technical challenges. Chloroplast genomes offer multiple advantages for codon compression and reassignment. Here we report a recoding scheme for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome, in which two stop codons and one or more of the codons for arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine and serine, all of which have two cognate tRNAs, are absent, compressing the genetic code to 51 codons. Firstly, several recoding strategies were tested on the essential rpoA gene, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast RNA polymerase. A defined compression scheme, which relied on swapping the target codons with the permitted frequent codons, could replace the native protein coding sequence without affecting chloroplast protein expression levels or the strain fitness. The same strategy was successfully used for codon compression of ycf1, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast translocon, psaA and psbA, intron-containing highly expressed genes encoding reaction centres subunits of both photosystems, and an 8.5 kb operon encoding essential and non-essential genes. Finally, we tested degeneracy of the 51-codon genetic code by exploring the combinatorial design for the large subunit of RuBisCO, relying on restoration of photosynthesis in an rbcL mutant strain. More than 70 functional sequences with diverse codon adaptation indices were recovered. In all codon-compressed genes there was no observable penalty on photosynthetic growth.

Significance StatementWe demonstrate the use of a chloroplast genome as a synthetic biology platform to test modifications of the universal genetic code. Elimination of 13 of the 64 possible triplet codes (codons) was possible for several essential and/or highly expressed genes without affecting chloroplast function. The technology is mature, paving the way for codon compression of the entire genome and thus enabling further radical rearrangement or expansion of the genetic code.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Here we present the GrimACE, the first fully standardised and automated cage-side monitoring tool for mice, the most widely used animals in research. The GrimACE uses computer vision to provide automated mouse grimace scale (MGS) assessment together with pose estimation in a dark, safe environment. We validated the system by analysing pain after brain surgeries (craniotomies) with head implants under two analgesia regimes. Human-expert and automated MGS scores showed very high correlation (Pearson's r=0.87). Both expert and automated scores revealed that a moderate increase in pain can be detected for up to 48 hours after surgeries, but that both a single dose of meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) or 3 doses of buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) + meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) provide adequate and comparable pain management. Simultaneous pose estimation demonstrated that mice receiving buprenorphine + meloxicam showed increased movement 4h after surgery, indicative of hyperactivity, a well-known side-effect of opioid treatment. Significant weight loss was also detected in the buprenorphine + meloxicam treatment group compared to the meloxicam-only group. Additionally, detailed BehaviorFlow analysis and automated MGS scoring of control animals suggests that habituation to the GrimACE system is unnecessary, and that measurements can be repeated multiple times, ensuring standardised post-operative recovery monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Despite this, only 3% of their encoded specialised metabolites have been matched to molecules and understanding how their biosynthesis is controlled is essential to fully exploit their potential. Here we use Streptomyces formicae and the formicamycin biosynthetic pathway as a model to understand the complex regulation of specialised metabolism. We analysed all three pathway-specific regulators and found that biosynthesis is subject to negative feedback and redox control via two MarR-family proteins while activation of the pathway is dependent on a cytoplasmic two-component system. Like many Streptomyces antibiotics, formicamycins are only produced in solid culture and biosynthesis is switched off in aerated liquid cultures. Here, we demonstrate that a redox-sensitive repressor named ForJ senses oxygen via a single cysteine residue that is required to repress formicamycin biosynthesis in liquid cultures.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study compares the overall spending, rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures within 30 days for Medicare fee-for-service patients who underwent in-person and telehealth evaluations between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022.

DesignA large-scale retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching

SettingPatients with no prior visits and 30-day episodes of care initiated by telehealth or in-person visits from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.

ParticipantsThis study included 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are aged >65 years while excluding those with Medicare Advantage coverage and those without continuous Medicare Parts A and B.

Exposure(s)Comparison of index visits initiated by telehealth versus in-person visits.

Primary outcomeAdjusted 30-day total spending.

Secondary outcomes30-day rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging.

ResultsThe study included 30,079,958 participants with 36,709,528 and 429,891,125 episodes initiated by telehealth and in-person visits, respectively. The mean age was 76 for telehealth and 75 years for in-person. Telehealth-initiated visits were associated with lower 30-day spending ($260 vs. $342; net: -$82), though return visit rates were higher for telehealth (16.1% vs. 14.1%). Both lab test rates (7.8% vs. 24.2%) and imaging rates (3.5% vs 7.8%) were lower for telehealth-initiated care episodes compared to in-person-initiated care episodes.

Conclusions and RelevanceTelehealth-initiated episodes of care were associated with lower 30-day Medicare spending and reduced utilization of labs and imaging. These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1742076499972

Using Xenopus egg extracts, we show that a replication fork encountering an SSB on either the leading- or lagging-strand template produces a single-ended double-strand break (seDSB). These broken ends are efficiently resolved by homologous recombination to yield D-loops and erroneous end-to-end fusions. Surprisingly, DNA synthesis downstream of an seDSB is highly inefficient. In contrast, when two forks converge at an SSB, they generate a double-ended DSB (deDSB) that efficiently completes DNA synthesis through double-strand break repair that is not dependent on homologous recombination. Leading, but not lagging, seDSBs can undergo extensive nucleolytic degradation that disassembles the divergent fork. These  secondary collapse events efficiently resolve seDSBs but without completion of DNA synthesis. Moreover, PARP inhibition can enhance fork collapse at unmodified SSBs but not at abasic site SSBs, contrary to expectations. Our findings distinguish end resolution from replication completion and demonstrate flexibility in how PARP inhibition affects fork collapse.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

It poses the difficult problem of continuous tracking of multiple agents, including both self and others. To understand how this tracking is implemented neurally, we examined responses of hippocampal neurons while humans performed a joystick-controlled continuous prey-pursuit task involving two simultaneously fleeing prey (and, in some cases, a predator) in a virtual open field. We found neural maps encoding the positions of all the agents. All maps were multiplexed in single neurons and were disambiguated by the use of the population coding principle of semi-orthogonal subspaces, which can facilitate cross-agent generalization. Some neurons, more common in the posterior hippocampus, had narrow tuning functions reminiscent of place cells, lower firing rates, and high information per spike; others, which were found in both anterior and posterior hippocampus, had broad tuning functions, higher firing rates, and less information per spike. Semi-orthogonalization was selectively associated with the broadly tuned neurons. These results suggest an answer to the problem of navigational individuation, that is, how mapping codes can distinguish different agents, and establish the neuronavigational foundations of pursuit.","NA","biorxiv",1742076499972

Prx1/AhpC-type peroxiredoxins are found throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, where multiple isoforms frequently coexist within the same cell and even in the same subcellular compartment. Long thought to form exclusively homooligomeric structures, we reveal that heterooligomerization is a conserved and important feature of eukaryotic Prx1/AhpC-type peroxiredoxins. We demonstrate that heterooligomer formation modulates peroxoredoxin oligomeric state and enhances structural stability. In yeast, Tsa1-Tsa2 peroxiredoxin heterodecamers form in response to oxidative stress and incorporated Tsa2 stabilizes the decameric state. Beyond yeast, we show that human PRDX1 and PRDX2, as well as plant and parasitic peroxiredoxins, engage in functional heterooligomerization. These findings challenge the long-held paradigm of peroxiredoxin homooligomerization and reveal a novel mechanism for regulating redox homeostasis.
