Drosophila larvae detect damaging heat, mechanical, and chemical stimuli with specialized multidendritic (md) neurons, and these cells are among the only sensory neurons that survive metamorphosis. However, it remains unknown which somatosensory neurons contribute to nociception in adult flies. In an optogenetic screen, we found that abdominal md neurons were the only somatosensory class to induce rapid escape and sustained place avoidance. Calcium imaging from abdominal md axons revealed that they are activated by thermal nociceptive stimuli (>40 {degrees}C). Connectomic reconstruction showed that md axons form their strongest synaptic connections with ascending interneurons that project to the brain. Among these, we identified two classes of ascending neurons that mediate rapid escape responses and a third that supports sustained avoidance. Our findings reveal that adult Drosophila meet several core criteria commonly used to define pain: dedicated nociceptors, ascending pathways connecting peripheral sensors to integrative brain centers, and a capacity for sustained avoidance of noxious stimuli.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Biosynthesis of this fatty acid, as well as tuberculostearic acid, requires precursor molecules produced by the essential long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (LCC) complex. The LCC complex catalyzes carboxylation of the -carbon of long-chain acyl-CoA, but also short-chain acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. The complex includes the subunits AccA3, which contains a biotin carboxylase (BC) domain and a biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain, the long-chain acyl-CoA carboxyltransferase AccD4, the short-chain acyl-CoA carboxyltransferase AccD5, and the incompletely characterized protein AccE. We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of the LCC complex from Mycobacterium smegmatis. In the structures, two AccE subunits tether eight AccA3 subunits to an AccD42AccD54 heterohexamer core. Cryo-EM of the enzyme during catalysis reveals how AccD4 and AccD5 achieve substrate specificity, with AccD5 binding tightly to CoA and AccD4 binding long acyl chains. The BCCP domains of AccA3 undergo long-distance translocation to transfer a carboxyl group from the BC domain of AccA3 to the acyl-CoA substrate bound in AccD5. Further, we find that two copies of a protein complex formed from MSMEG_0435 and MSMEG_0436 can bind the LCC complex, sequestering the biotin moiety of BCCP domains near AccD5. Rv0263c, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis ortholog of MSMEG_0435, has a role in bacterial survival during transmission, suggesting that these proteins may regulate production of branched fatty acid precursors for the mycobacterial cell wall.","[{""name"":""Canadian Institutes of Health Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gavpb45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Canada Graduate Scholarship - Doctoral;""},{""name"":""Canada Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0517h6h17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Canada Research Chair - Tier 1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

The resulting structures adopted their intended topologies and showed exceptional resistance to thermal and chemical denaturation.

Despite their widespread adoption, biological parts are complex and when used in a new molecular context can result in unexpected outcomes. Site-specific recombinases have been widely used due to their unique ability to induce precise, irreversible changes to a DNA sequence, making them ideal tools for memory logic operations. However, unexpected context-specific failures of even the most widely used recombinase, Cre, has limited the expansion and complexity of synthetic gene circuits in diverse species. Here, through a systematic analysis of Cre failure in plant gene circuits, we uncovered multiple unexpected post-recombination interactions within the transcriptional unit between the promoter region, recombinase, and their cognate recognition sites. These significantly inhibit transcriptional activity, preventing circuit functionality. Specifically, post-recombination Cre recombinase exhibits an inhibitory property by binding to lox sites, with the remaining lox site repressing transcription. By thoroughly characterizing these dynamics, we restored Cre functionality and expanded the plant-based recombinase toolkit for Cre-related recombinases, developing combinations of recombinases and cognate sites with different activation levels for constructing logic gates with stable memory functions. We further developed multiple functional split-recombinase systems for simultaneous logic using a range of dimerization domains and constructed complex logic gates, including 3-input and 6-input AND gates. Together, this exploration of component context dependency in genetic circuits, even with commonly used parts like the Cre/lox system, has implications extending beyond plant systems, and significantly expands plant memory circuit capabilities.","[{""name"":""Australian Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mmh0f86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP240103385;DP210103954;""},{""name"":""ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01a1mq059"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CE140100008;""},{""name"":""ARC Centre of Excellence in Plants for Space"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CE230100015;""},{""name"":""NHMRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GNT1178460;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UWA Research Training Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Twist Bioscholar Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The University of Western Australia"",""id"":""https://ror.org/047272k79"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Grains Research and Development Corporation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xwr1996"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Here, we quantify the dendritic morphology together with electrical properties, local inputs, and/or projections of 1,093 insular pyramidal neurons. These neurons are mapped onto a quantitative anatomical model of the insula based on a Nissl-staining coordinate framework. Using improved algorithms, we define 21 morphological, 12 electrical, and 9 input neuronal types, and identify several morphological and input types that are unique to the insula. Further, we find that morphological properties constrain and often predict inputs, electrical properties, or projection targets. Several morphological types are differentially distributed between the functionally distinct anterior and posterior insula, providing the substrates for a quantitative demarcation between the anterior and posterior insular subregions. Surprisingly, certain neuronal types receive intra-insular inputs originating far beyond canonical cortical columns. Functionally, these connections bridge a long-range thalamus-to-amygdalar circuit that potentially links sensory information to valence.

Many developmental genes are controlled by multiple, redundant enhancers, raising the question of how robust regulatory systems can be dismantled to permit phenotypic transitions. We show that the loss of larval trichomes in Drosophila sechellia resulted from the independent inactivation of four embryonic enhancers of the shavenbaby gene. Each enhancer was extinguished by a distinct mechanism: (1) a large deletion that removed essential sequences, (2) the loss of activator sites and gain of repressor sites, (3) the acquisition of a long-range silencer, and (4) the unmasking of pre-existing repression. Notably, three of these mechanisms relied on repression, pointing to repression as a rapid route for the evolutionary loss of robust regulatory elements. These results show that robustness in gene regulation does not prevent morphological change but instead provides multiple opportunities for mutations to reduce enhancer activity, giving selection many paths to reshape form.","[{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""No. 2567/20;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Even with single-stained controls, however, these matrixes include errors such as spillover spread, which compounds with each additional parameter, functionally limiting panel design. An additional source of errors is heterogeneity of cellular autofluorescence, which can affect both the unmixing matrix and misalign signals when the matrix is applied to individual cells in complex cell mixtures. Here we developed AutoSpectral, a statistical approach to automate the production of minimal-residual error unmixing matrixes and pair multiple distinct multifluorescent spectra to individual cells within a mixed sample, via an R-based software tool. AutoSpectral improves unmixing accuracy, improving incorrectly assigned cell positions by up to 9000-fold, reduces spread, particularly in samples with variable autofluorescence, and allows multi-lineage analysis of mixed populations, providing superior data for spectral flow cytometry experiments.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/Y004450/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""222442/A/21/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

To address this question, we employed a biologically informed whole-brain computational model capable of generating distinct brain states, from awake-like to sleep-like regimes. Our model was constrained by empirical human structural connectivity and spatial maps of cholinergic receptor gene expression, thereby embedding regional neuromodulatory variability into a macroscopic framework. We found that incorporating cholinergic heterogeneity had a significant impact on brain dynamics: it not only facilitated network synchronization but also enhanced information flow between brain regions. Furthermore, we addressed a particularly intricate dynamic regime characterized by the coexistence of localized sleep-like activity within otherwise awake-like states. We showed that the emergence of these slow waves was a byproduct of both regional levels of neuronal adaptation and structural connectivity.

We find that humans with Parkinson's disease (PD) had increased timing variability that predicted PD-related cognitive deficits and executive dysfunction. Surprisingly, lesioning ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons increased temporal variability. Further, GCaMP6s fiber photometry demonstrated that VTA dopamine neuron activity is strongly modulated at the start of temporal intervals, and that this trial start related activity predicted temporal variability. Finally, we found that stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons improved timing by decreasing temporal variability in both intact and dopamine depleted animals.

This provides a unique entry for evaluating how such simplified cells can evolve and improve their proliferation potential while exploring unknown mechanisms modulating cell cycle progression.

This equilibrium is often disrupted in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition understood to exist along a continuum of traits in the general population. While ADHD is consistently linked to response inhibition deficits, its relationship with statistical learning (a mechanism for habit learning) and, crucially, the interaction between these functions, remains underexplored. Here, using a novel paradigm in a non-clinical sample of university students (n = 226), we investigated how ADHD-like traits modulate the interplay between response inhibition and statistical learning. We found that higher ADHD-like traits were associated with poorer response inhibition, confirming previous research. Importantly, we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between inhibition and statistical learning, where weaker inhibitory control typically led to enhanced learning of environmental regularities. However, this learning advantage progressively diminished across the ADHD trait continuum, becoming markedly reduced in individuals with high symptom prevalence. These findings provide novel evidence that ADHD-like traits influence not only isolated neurocognitive processes but also their dynamic interaction, highlighting a spectrum-based mechanism that may underlie the transition from adaptive variability to maladaptive behavioral patterns. This work advocates for a dimensional approach to ADHD, emphasizing early detection and targeted interventions for individuals with varying levels of symptomatic expression, broadening support beyond traditional diagnostic boundaries.","[{""name"":""French National Grant Agency"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-22-CPJ1-0042-01;ANR-24-CE37-5807;""},{""name"":""National Brain Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NAP2022-I-2/2022;""},{""name"":""EKÖP-24 University Excellence Scholarship Program of the Ministry for Culture and Innovation from the Source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EKÖP-24-3-II-ELTE-1159;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

These early embryonic mutations often go undetected in clinical sequencing due to their low variant allele fraction (VAF) and are typically excluded by standard variant filtering pipelines. To overcome this limitation, we developed a bioinformatic approach to detect PZMs using standard-depth ([~]30X) whole genome sequencing data from 12,015 parent-offspring trios in the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project. We identified 1,015 high-confidence autosomal early PZMs. These mutations showed no parental sex-bias and exhibited a monomodal VAF distribution centred around 5% in blood. PZMs displayed a mutational spectrum distinct from de novo mutations, although both appeared to be driven by mutational signatures SBS1 and SBS5. Notably, we identified a subset of PZMs likely contributing to the clinical phenotype in affected children. This work demonstrates that postzygotic mosaicism represents a rare but clinically relevant source of diagnostic variation in rare disease and can be detected from standard sequencing data. Incorporating PZM detection into clinical workflow could improve diagnostic yield and provide more accurate recurrence risk estimates for affected families.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761862207167

Such a decrease is often linked to the impact of visual memory decay and the sensory transformation of visual target positional information into haptic-specific coordinates. It is, however, unclear whether this holds for haptically encoded spatial locations, where the target and reaching arm positions are both defined through haptics. Here, we asked participants to perform memory-guided right-handed reaching movements toward targets held with the left hand. In the Delay block, the left hand was removed after 2 seconds, and a right-handed reach was performed after a variable delay of 2, 4, or 6 seconds. In the No-delay block, the left hand was on the target for the entire duration of the trial. Targets were positioned in front (Center) and to the Left of the participants, such that the posture of the left arm during encoding was either the same or different from the final posture of the contralateral reaching arm. The introduction of the shortest delay caused a decrease in accuracy and precision, indicating that on-line haptic inputs play a crucial role in guiding reaching movements. However, performance did not worsen with longer delays, particularly when the two arms were in similar postures. Our findings suggest that postural information may contribute to guiding actions when on-line haptic feedback is unavailable.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Here, to clarify the mechanical links between cell adhesion, protrusions, and migration, we analyzed glioblastoma-derived cells migrating on fibronectin- and laminin-coated extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates using time-lapse imaging and mathematical modeling. We quantified cell motility on each ECM and constructed a coarse-grained biophysical model that incorporates catch- and slip-bond kinetics. We treated the ECM as an external boundary condition that modulates adhesion dynamics, distinct from the intrinsic mechanical parameters of the cell. The model reproduced ECM-dependent differences in cell motility. The results suggest that adhesions and protrusion elongation on fibronectin are less stable than on laminin, and opposing forces between protrusions reduce net displacement more strongly on fibronectin than on laminin, leading to less coordinated tensile forces. Based on these results, we establish mechanical polarity, defined as an imbalance of protrusion- and adhesion-mediated forces that drive directional migration, as a quantifiable physical principle of cell protrusion and migration. This principle likely extends beyond glioblastoma biology, providing a generalizable mechanism that links adhesion dynamics to migration stability and offering a physical basis for strategies to suppress invasive cell behavior.","[{""name"":""The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20H04283;23H04707;""},{""name"":""The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) SPRING"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJSP2140;""},{""name"":""the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP17gm0810011;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

While tau is reported to drive neurotoxicity by negatively affecting cytoskeletal, nucleoskeletal, and genomic architecture, the mechanisms mediating tau-induced dysfunction of the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton are incompletely understood. Based on proteomic profiling, we identify a suite of cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal proteins with differing abundance in a cellular model of tauopathy, iTau. Building upon previous findings that pathogenic forms of tau reduce nuclear tension, we find that protein levels of emerin, a central regulator of nuclear mechanotransduction, are significantly elevated in iTau cells and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying a mutation in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene that causes autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia. We find that neuronal emerin overexpression is sufficient to drive neurotoxicity, increase overall levels of filamentous actin (F-actin), and induce nuclear invagination, cellular phenotypes that also occur in settings of tauopathy. Mass spectrometry-based identification of emerin-interacting proteins in iTau-derived neurons reveals increased interactions with cytoskeletal proteins and reduced interactions with nuclear proteins. Indeed, we find that emerin relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytosol in the setting of tauopathy, suggesting that pathogenic tau impacts nuclear mechanotransduction pathways. Overall, we identify emerin as a mediator of cytoskeletal remodeling in tauopathy and provide a foundation for future studies into the mechanosensitive function of emerin in neurons.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCells experience and respond to diverse mechanical forces that shape their morphology, function, and survival through a process termed ""mechanotransduction."" While well studied in non-neuronal cells, neuronal mechanotransduction remains poorly understood despite exposure of the brain to vascular flow, movement, injury, and disease. We identify the mechanosensitive protein emerin as a key regulator of nuclear mechanotransduction in neurons. Emerin overexpression is sufficient to increase filamentous actin, induce nuclear invagination, and drive neurotoxicity, revealing a novel function for emerin in neurons. In cellular models of tauopathy, emerin is elevated and relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it alters cytoskeletal structure. These findings establish emerin as a mechanosensitive regulator in neurons and link disrupted nuclear neuronal mechanotransduction to neurodegeneration.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Aging"",""id"":""https://ror.org/049v75w11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AG057896;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31 NS137774;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Previous work shows greater diversity than heretofore expected (1) and that also increases more quickly during a patients clinical course than previously thought (1, 2). Rare subclones will harbor pre-existing resistance to any single agent and may cause medium to late term relapse (1), which may evolve further variants that have simultaneous resistance to non-cross resistant therapies (3, 4). We now present a probability distribution function (PDF) of the variant allele fraction (VAF) or prevalence of a rare subclone, derived from previous evolutionary theory (1, 2). We show that current clinical sequencing protocols fail to detect the vast majority of rare subclones. By the time of detection, simultaneous multiple resistance may evolve. We then apply the PDF to simulation of dynamic precision medicine (DPM) (3), an evolutionary guided precision medicine paradigm that attempts to proactively eliminate singly-resistant subclones before they evolve multiple resistance, with significant potential to extend survival. We show that the simulated benefit of DPM with perfect information is degraded by inability to detect rare subclones if they are assumed to be absent when undetectable. But this benefit is restored if the PDF is used to calculate the likelihood of the subclone being present below the level of detection and incorporated into the DPM simulation and therapy recommendations in a probabilistic fashion. Moreover, other common statistical distributions are less effective. This theoretical advance facilitates DPM and potentially other evolutionary guided approaches to precision cancer medicine in spite of the limitations of clinical sequencing.

Significance StatementCancers contain many cells, each genetically unique. These variations can include pre-existing resistance to therapy, enabling relapse. DNA sequencing cannot detect minority cellular populations (subclones) below a certain size, by which time they may have evolved simultaneous resistance to multiple therapies. We present a mathematical approach that enables assigning a risk that a subclone is present, and at what prevalence in the cellular population, even when undetected. We simulate applying this approach to dynamic precision medicine (DPM), which attempts to proactively eliminate singly resistant cells before they become resistant to multiple therapies. Using this probability distribution, we can retain the benefit of DPM even when most rare subclones are undetectable, in contrast to just assuming undetected subclones are absent.","[{""name"":""Department of Defense (DoD) Breast Cancer Research Program Awards"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""W81XWH-20-1-0759;W81XWH-20-1-0760;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health Cancer Center Support Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5P30CA051008;""},{""name"":""National Science & Technology Council in the Republic of China (Taiwan)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""108-2118-M-001-001-MY2;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation Grants"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#2138259;#2138286;#2138307;#2137603;#2138296;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Here, we show that MAP4 and MAP7D1 selectively partition onto distinct microtubule subsets demarcated by tyrosination and detyrosination, respectively, creating specialized tracks for kinesin motors. MAP4s preferential binding depends on its projection domain, while expanded microtubule lattice states mediate MAP7D1s enrichment on detyrosinated microtubules. Remarkably, rigor kinesin-1 (KIF5B-R) predominantly localizes to detyrosinated, MAP7D1-coated tracks, whereas rigor kinesin-3 (KIF1A) prefers tyrosinated, MAP4-decorated microtubules. We further find that the local density of MAP4 and MAP7D1 on microtubules fine-tunes lysosomal movement and directional transport. Moreover, MAP density is modulated to coordinate lysosomal reorganization in response to nutrient availability. During starvation MAP7D1 density on microtubules increases while MAP4 density decreases, localizing lysosomes to the perinuclear region. Conversely, with nutrient stimulation, MAPD1 density declines, allowing lysosomes to migrate towards the cell periphery. Altering the cellular levels of MAP4 and MAP7D1, either up or down, hinders lysosomal motility, trapping them near the nucleus and impairing their responsiveness to nutrient stimulation. Together, our findings reveal two distinct MAP-PTM circuits, a MAP4-tyrosination-kinesin-3 axis and a MAP7D1- detyrosination-kinesin-1 axis, that govern lysosome positioning for nutrient signaling, highlighting the combinatorial logic of MAP and tubulin codes in shaping microtubule function.","[{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India (DBT)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BT/RLF/Re-entry/39/2018;""},{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ffdsr55"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRG/2022/008391;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Here, we investigated how increased mechanical stress from extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening shapes endothelial cell (EC) senescence. We developed a 3D human in vitro model that decouples mechanical stress from inflammatory or biochemical inputs, enabling the study of senescence responses to tissue stiffening alone. We found that matrix stiffening induces an EC senescence phenotype with elevated p16/p21 and an immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), in the absence of inflammatory signals. This mechano-induced senescence state engaged a Notch-JNK-FOS signaling axis, and pharmacologic inhibition of Notch attenuated stiffness-induced senescence. Supporting the translational relevance of this mechanism, analysis of fibrotic capsule tissue from patients with synthetic breast implants, a model of localized, mechanically driven fibrosis, revealed increased p16+Notch1+ endothelial populations. Complementary single-cell RNA sequencing data confirmed their enrichment in Notch/JNK- and SASP-related gene programs. Together, these findings define vascular senescence as a mechanosensitive process and identify tissue stiffening as an upstream aging signal.

However, their behavior within cells remains controversial, partly due to challenges in detecting rG4s in complex environments. Here, we use solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate how condensates formed by the low-complexity and RGG domains of the RNA-binding protein FUS affect the structure of TERRA, a highly stable model rG4 RNA. We show that FUS LC-RGG1 interacts with TERRA in dilute solution and that binding perturbs, but does not disrupt, the G-quadruplex structure. When co-phase separated with FUS LC-RGG1, however, NMR signatures of TERRA's folded state disappear, and the remaining observable resonances indicate an unfolded conformation, even in buffer containing potassium where TERRA rG4 is exceptionally stable when outside a condensate. Quantitative comparisons with a mutant form of TERRA, used as a baseline for fully unfolded RNA, suggest that at minimum a third of TERRA RNA becomes unfolded in the condensed phase. Thus, our results demonstrate that condensates can shift the structural ensemble of rG4 towards unfolded species, offering a potential mechanistic explanation for their apparent lack of stability in vivo and revealing how phase-separated environments may actively modulate RNA structure and function.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM147677;""},{""name"":""Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00mwp5989"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23-PDF-629;""},{""name"":""Carney Institute for Brain Science, Brown University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

However, empirical evidence for consistent biodiversity-structure relationships across taxa is still limited. We investigated whether structurally more complex forests support greater species richness and higher multidiversity across taxonomic and functional groups in 19 mature forest plots in Flanders, Belgium. As one of the most densely populated and urbanized regions in Europe, with limited and highly fragmented forest cover, Flanders provides a particularly informative and policy-relevant context to test structure-biodiversity relationships. Its forests, often dominated by a few tree species and subject to long-term anthropogenic pressures and management, represent a realistic gradient of structural complexity. Structural complexity was quantified using a Structural Complexity Index (SCI), and biodiversity was assessed using a multidiversity index integrating scaled species richness across five taxonomic and seven arthropod functional groups. Using mixed-effects models and multivariate Bayesian analyses, we tested both direct effects of SCI on biodiversity and the covariation in species richness among groups. Contrary to expectations, SCI was not a consistent predictor of multidiversity, and most groups showed weak or inconsistent responses. These findings might suggest that structural complexity alone may be insufficient to enhance biodiversity in simplified forests.","[{""name"":""GOA project"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BOF20/GOA/009;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

To address this problem, we generated a uniformly pre-processed Consensus Pituitary Atlas (CPA) using all existing mouse pituitary single-cell datasets (267 biological replicates, >1.1 million high-quality cells). The CPA revealed novel cell typing and lineage markers, including low-expression transcripts that previous analyses could not detect. The scale of the CPA enabled the development of machine learning models to automate and standardize cell type annotation and doublet identification for future studies. Leveraging the curated metadata, we identified sex-biased and age-dependent gene expression patterns at cell type resolution. To identify drivers of cell fates, first we determined consensus cell communication patterns. Secondly, we used RNA-sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to identify transcription factors associated with cell fates across modalities. The epitome platform acts as an interface with the CPA, allowing streamlined user-friendly analyses.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Current methods, often linear and reliant on summary statistics, fail to capture complex genetic interactions and discard valuable individual-level information. We introduce PRSformer, a scalable deep learning architecture designed for end-to-end, multitask disease prediction directly from million-scale individual genotypes. PRSformer employs neighborhood attention, achieving linear O(L) complexity per layer, making Transformers tractable for genome-scale inputs. Crucially, PRSformer utilizes a stacking of these efficient attention layers, progressively increasing the effective receptive field to model local dependencies (e.g., within linkage disequilibrium blocks) before integrating information across wider genomic regions. This design, tailored for genomics, allows PRSformer to learn complex, potentially non-linear and long-range interactions directly from raw genotypes. We demonstrate PRSformers effectiveness using a unique large private cohort (N {approx} 5M) for predicting 18 autoimmune and inflammatory conditions using L {approx} 140k variants. PRSformer significantly outperforms highly optimized linear models trained on the same individual-level data and state-of-the-art summary-statistic-based methods (LDPred2) derived from the same cohort, quantifying the benefits of non-linear modeling and multitask learning at scale. Furthermore, experiments reveal that the advantage of non-linearity emerges primarily at large sample sizes (N > 1M), and that a multi-ancestry trained model improves generalization, establishing PRSformer as a new framework for deep learning in population-scale genomics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which SHIP1 mediates its role in suppressing inflammatory pathways, with a focus on human microglia. Our findings illuminate an essential role for SHIP1 in endosome maturation and lysosomal function. We show that SHIP1 localizes to both the plasma membrane and to endo-lysosomal compartments and binds to the CapZ family of proteins, which are important for endosome maturation. Reduction of SHIP1 levels via genome editing impairs endosome maturation and lysosomal function, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and leakage of lysosomal cathepsin B into the cytosol, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. CITE-seq profiling of SHIP1-deficient microglia revealed a shift from an immune-responsive state toward a DAM-like, phagocytic state, accompanied by impaired response to LPS and enhanced phagocytosis of synaptic material and apoptotic neurons via TREM2. While amyloid-{beta} uptake was not affected, amyloid-{beta} accumulated intracellularly due to defective lysosomal degradation, further driving lipid droplet formation. Together, these results identify SHIP1 as a regulator of endo-lysosomal function and selective phagocytosis of lipid-rich substrates in microglia. These findings have important implications for therapeutic hypotheses that target SHIP1 for treatment of AD, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01AG072572;R01AG055909;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CS-02018-191971;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Zenith Award;""},{""name"":""Harvard Medical School"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wevmz92"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Edward R. and Anne G.

In the colon, this barrier is repeatedly challenged by mechanical distension from faeces and it is unknown whether and how the colon adapts to such stress, which could otherwise compromise barrier integrity. Here, we show that faeces-mediated mechanical distension triggers coordinated remodelling at cell- and tissue-scale, suggestive of mechanoadaptation. This response includes recruitment of junctional proteins at all three types of adhesive cell-cell junctions (tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes). We identified two modes of recruitment: stable responders (ZO-1, E-cad, plakoglobin) with sustained junctional enrichment, and adaptive responders (desmoplakin, keratin 8) with progressive accumulation during distension. Distension was also accompanied by perijunctional recruitment and activation of non-muscle myosin II (NMMII). Through genetic, pharmacological, and mechanical perturbations, we demonstrated that NMMII activation is an early and critical step for mechanoadaptation. This process requires extracellular calcium influx, and Piezo1 activation is sufficient to trigger NMMII activation and junctional recruitment. Loss of NMMII function abrogated the junctional response to distension across all three junctional complexes, including desmosomes, resulting in disorganised junctions and barrier breach. Together, our findings uncover a robust physiological mechano-adaptive response of the adult colonic epithelium to an extrinsic mechanical stress, whereby coordinated reinforcement of all junctional complexes, controlled by myosin II and mechanosensitive calcium influx, plays an essential role in preserving intestinal barrier integrity.","[{""name"":""Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ATIP-Avenir;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

This work benchmarks the scalability, efficiency, and accuracy of five widely used analysis frameworks (Seurat, OSCA, scrapper, Scanpy, and rapids_singlecell), focusing on the impact of algorithmic and infrastructural choices on performance. We performed a systematic comparison of these workflows using representative datasets, including the 1.3M mouse brain dataset for scalability and three smaller datasets (BE1, sc_mixology, and cord blood CITE-seq) with ground truth labels to assess clustering accuracy. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used as a paradigmatic step to evaluate the computational performance of six SVD algorithms (exact, ARPACK, IRLBA, randomized, Jacobi, and incremental PCA) across multiple data representations (dense, sparse, HDF5) and hardware configurations (CPU vs GPU). All methods showed high concordance in PCA results, with negligible loss of accuracy in truncated approaches. GPU-based computation using rapids_singlecell provided a 15x speed-up over the best CPU methods, with moderate memory usage. On CPU, ARPACK and IRLBA were the most efficient for sparse matrices, while randomized SVD performed best for HDF5-backed data. Among full pipelines, rapids_singlecell was the fastest, whereas OSCA and scrapper achieved the highest clustering accuracy (ARI up to 0.97) in datasets with known cell identities. Performance differences were largely driven by the choice of highly variable genes (HVGs) and PCA implementation. The study highlights that scalability in scRNA-seq analysis depends critically on both algorithmic and infrastructural factors. GPU acceleration and optimized BLAS/LAPACK configurations markedly enhance performance, while Bioconductor-based pipelines remain robust in accuracy. The provided benchmarks offer practical guidelines for efficient and reliable analysis of large-scale single-cell datasets.","[{""name"":""Italian Association for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02g2x7380"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IG29071;""},{""name"":""National Center for HPC, BIG DATA AND QUANTUM COMPUTING"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CN00000013 CN1;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U24CA289073-02;2U24HG004059-17;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000644;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

Although factors such as movement, vibration, and pressure are often studied individually, touch requires their integration to produce complex sensations. We investigated these processes jointly by recording single-unit activity via microneurography from human LTM afferents in the median nerve as periodic gratings slid across their receptive fields, varying the normal force and sliding velocity per trial. Mixed-effects models revealed that fast-adapting type 1 (FA-1) afferent firing was influenced by all three parameters - force, velocity, and spatial period. Slowly-adapting type 1 (SA-1) afferent firing was primarily driven by force, and to a lesser extent, velocity. These findings support the view that FA-1 afferents encode stimulus intensity in an approximately linear manner, while SA-1 afferents function mainly as force detectors, demonstrating that mechanoreceptive afferents provide a complementary and multidimensional representation of texture during sliding contact. This distributed encoding challenges the notion that LTMs are dedicated to single stimulus features, suggesting that tactile information is represented across LTM populations where each class contributes differently-weighted inputs to capture skin-object interactions.","[{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K2007-63X-03548;K2010-62X-03548;2021-02552;""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EU FP6 NANOBIOTACT 33287;EU Horizon 2020 MSCA NEUTOUCH 813713;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207167

We characterize the spike loop2 region as a critical determinant of ACE2 receptor specificity, directly interacting with the receptor, and show that the bat HKU5r-CoV with the closest loop2 sequence to nvHKU5r-CoV could already utilize mink ACE2. Using AlphaFold3, we predicted spike-ACE2 binding interfaces consistent with our experimental infectivity results. Targeted mutagenesis demonstrates that a single amino acid substitution (R548S) enables robust entry of nvHKU5r-CoV via human ACE2. We further show that this substitution can arise in vitro during hACE2-expressing cell infection with a replication-competent VSV system. Molecular dating suggests that nvHKU5r-CoV transmitted from bats to mink within the last decade, consistent with an expansion of mink fur farming in China. Overall, our findings highlight the zoonotic potential of these viruses and the molecular and structural determinants underlying it, while emphasizing fur farming as a major risk factor for how bat HKU5r-CoVs can transmit to farmed animals and ultimately humans.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

In the vertebrate spinal cord, progenitors are patterned into molecularly defined domains, but how lineage relationships shape neuronal diversity and function has remained unclear. Here, we combine genomic barcoding with single- cell RNA sequencing in chick and human embryos to generate cell-type-resolved clonal maps. We find that spinal neurogenesis follows a hierarchical organisation in which the neural tube first partitions into five broad subdivisions that resolve into the eleven progenitor domains generating the cardinal neuronal classes. This bifurcating architecture implies a patterning mechanism of sequential binary decisions. The most prominent lineage restriction occurs at the embryonic alar-basal boundary, separating sensory-processing from motor-control circuits. Individual progenitors generate neurons across multiple temporal waves while remaining constrained within their lineage subdivision, demonstrating persistence of spatial identity despite temporal competence changes. Among sensory populations, we identify two developmental routes, via unifated or bifated progenitors, to pain- and itch-processing interneurons. These principles are conserved between chick and human, with clonal analysis in human embryos revealing that most fate choices are resolved by six weeks post-conception. Together, these findings provide a framework for spinal cord development and reveal lineage compartmentalisation as a fundamental principle in neural circuit assembly and evolution.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051),;""},{""name"":""Wellcome"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;220379/D/20/Z;218670/Z/19/Z;215116/Z/18/Z;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""742138;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""792-2021;""},{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X031225/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

To stabilize proteins during simulation, Martini is typically combined with structure-based force fields such as elastic network models (ENMs) or G[o] models. While these approaches preserve global folds and capture protein flexibility, their ability to reproduce conformational dynamics remains unclear. Here, we benchmark Martini combined with ENMs or G[o] models on three folded proteins and show that both approaches struggle to sample the conformational space observed in atomistic simulations, even when uniform interaction strengths or equilibrium bond distances are adjusted. This limitation arises from the assumption of a uniform interaction network, in which all bond energies are equal. To overcome this, we present a fully automated, perturbation-based optimization approach for G[o] networks, PoG[o], that iteratively refines a non-uniform G[o] network against a pre-computed atomistic free energy landscape in essential conformational space. Our approach converges rapidly, yielding CG ensembles in close agreement with reference atomistic simulations.

A typical cell contains [~]1000s of copies of mtDNA, but how this copy number is stably maintained is unclear. Here, we track mtDNA copy number (mtCN) recovery in K562 cells following transient, chemically induced depletion to uncover principles of mtCN stability. Below a critical mtCN, ETC activity fails to sustain the proton motive force (PMF) and de novo pyrimidine synthesis--both required for mtDNA replication. PMF-dependent processes like Fe-S cluster biogenesis are also disrupted and stress responses are activated that impair cell proliferation and limit further mtCN dilution by cell division. Nonetheless, mtDNA replication and recovery remain possible via mtDNA-independent PMF, generated by complex V reversal, and uridine salvage. Once mtCN is restored, the ETC and forward complex V activity re-engage, stress responses subside, and proliferation recommences. Each cell division then dilutes mtDNA, serving as a built- in brake on mtCN. Our findings suggest that mtCN homeostasis emerges from the balance of two opposing PMF-driven processes -- mtDNA replication and cell proliferation -- revealing a bioenergetic logic that preserves mtDNA euploidy through repeated cell divisions.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K00CA212468;K99GM145848;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

To address this, we used directed evolution in human cells to select variants with greatly improved homology-directed repair (HDR) activity. The resulting variants, Cas12f1Super and TnpBSuper, exhibited up to 11-fold increase in editing efficiency without increased off-target effects.

Understanding and optimising transgene expression is crucial for a wide variety of applications which range from investigating basic biology, synthetic biology, recombinant protein production to gene therapy. However, precise control over the timing and location of transgene expression remains a key limitation, particularly in therapeutic contexts where specificity and compactness are critical.

To address limitations of traditional promoter-based transgene construct approaches, we developed TRANCERs (TRanscriptionally Autonomous enhaNCERs), a modular and compact system that transforms cell type-specific enhancers into standalone sources of productive transcription. To accomplish this, we leveraged basic facets of enhancer function as well as known and novel principles of transcript stability and nuclear export.

We demonstrate that TRANCERs can drive lineage-restricted expression of both reporter and therapeutic genes across multiple mammalian cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and that this expression pattern faithfully mirrors the activity of the enhancer element used. Enhancer elements are the most cell type specific element in the mammalian genome and are used to drive development, differentiation and cellular responses to extrinsic signals. Therefore, the TRANCER system allows for the generation of specific stable expression constructs for all conceivable situations for which a native enhancer exists with the required activity pattern. Furthermore, we show that the TRANCER system is compatible with previously published machine learning derived artificial enhancer sequences suggesting the possibility even for specific bespoke expression patterns that do not exist in nature. This, combined with a significantly reduced vector footprint ideal for size-constrained delivery systems such as lentiviral vectors, means that the TRANCER system represent a significant step forward in our ability to control gene expression for both basic biology and therapeutic applications.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_UU_00016/14;MC_UU_00029/3;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""225220/Z/22/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

However, the large number of features generated by functional connectivity approaches may overfit the data. These problems can be overcome with either feature selection (FS) or dimensionality reduction (DR), which can be applied to less complex models. We utilize two open-source datasets to compare the performance of DR/FS methods on cognitive task decoding using a suite of ML classifiers. New Method While DR and FS methods have been used previously in decoding research, no systematic comparison of their performance has been undertaken. Here, we compare available methods using commonly utilized machine learning libraries to establish which methods provide the best predictive performance. We then conduct statistical tests to examine the relative contributions of DR and FS methods and classifiers on decoding accuracy. Results Neither DR or FS was found to be superior. However, differences were identified across datasets and tasks. In the majority of methods and datasets, a peak in predictive performance was found using a small percentage of the total number of original features. Comparison with existing methods Some methods perform better than the baseline method of prediction with all available features or selecting features randomly. Decoding performance utilizing the HCP datasets with certain DR/FS methods exceeds that of deep learning approaches. Conclusions Simple machine learning models with DR/FS have competitive decoding performance. These results suggest a sweet spot for the tradeoff between the retention of features and predictive accuracy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

To this end, we introduce velotest, a cell-level statistical test that quantifies the faithfulness of a velocity embedding with respect to its high-dimensional counterpart. Applying velotest across multiple datasets and embedding methods, we find strong differences in the embedding qualities between embedding methods, datasets, and regions in individual datasets. velotest thus provides an essential validation step and enables researchers to select a suitable visualization of high-dimensional velocities, ensuring that hypotheses drawn from velocity projections are grounded in accurately represented dynamics.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390727645;520388526;""},{""name"":""Bundesministerium für Forschung, Technologie und Raumfahrt"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""01IS18039;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

However, some species undergo programmed DNA elimination (PDE), whereby specific genome regions are removed from somatic cell lineages early during development, leading to distinct germline and somatic genomes. Since its discovery in parasitic nematodes over a century ago, PDE has been observed in diverse eukaryotes, including ciliates, arthropods, and vertebrates. However, the function, mechanisms, and evolutionary origins of PDE remain poorly understood. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of PDE in three early-diverging Caenorhabditis species. Using long-read and chromatin conformation capture sequencing, we reconstructed germline and somatic genomes for all three species, and found that between 0.7 and 2.3% of the genome is eliminated during the 8- to 16-cell stage of embryogenesis, including the telomeres and regions within chromosomes. Elimination of regions within chromosomes results in fragmentation of the six germline chromosomes into 8-15 somatic chromosomes. The sites of elimination are precise, and we identified conserved motifs that likely recruit a nuclease to induce double-strand breaks. The newly formed somatic chromosome ends are healed by de novo telomere addition. A small number of genes are eliminated in each species, some of which have C. elegans orthologues with essential germline functions. A subset of elimination sites are orthologous across species, and some coincide with genome rearrangement sites. The phylogenetic distribution of PDE suggests that it was present in the last common Caenorhabditis ancestor and subsequently lost early during the evolution of many species, including C. elegans.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220540/Z/20/A;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJCR18S7;JPMJCR24B4;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP23K17400;JP24H00549;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

All previously characterized retrons produce high levels of multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) in the cell by reverse transcription, which acts as an antitoxin in the absence of phage infection. However, we describe here a non-canonical mechanism for Type VI retrons, which do not produce detectable msDNA in the absence of phage, yet still provide phage defense. Focusing primarily on Retron-Vpa2, a Type VI retron from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we show broad defense against phages and identify triggers of the system within phage recombination systems. Within the Retron-Vpa2 operon, we find a highly enriched, structured transcript that we term a hybrid RNA (hyRNA), which contains both the retrons reverse transcription template and a translationally repressed toxic effector coding sequence. We find that phage infection induces the accumulation of high levels of msDNA and that this msDNA is necessary for derepressing translation of the antiviral toxin. These findings present key biological and mechanistic insights into a distinct group of retrons while highlighting the diversity of systems that participate in bacterial immunity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we here identified the bridge-like lipid transport protein VPS13C/PARK23 as a key component of a global early response pathway to lysosome damage. VPS13C readily binds lysosomes under mechanical or osmotic tension in anticipation of membrane lesions. The latter trigger a conformational change in the proteins C-terminus, involving its ATG2C domain acting as sensor of damage-induced lipid packing defects. We show that ER-lysosome contacts formed by VPS13C provide critical binding platforms for OSBP/ORPs to enable efficient ER wrapping of damaged lysosomes. A chemical approach to assess directional ER-to-lysosome lipid transport revealed that VPS13C is essential for large-scale lipid delivery to acutely damaged lysosomes to facilitate their repair. Our findings offer new mechanistic insights into how loss-of-function mutations in VPS13C may enhance the risk of Parkinsons disease.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""512783018;467522186/SFB1557–P9;467522186/SFB1557–P6;467522186/SFB1557–Z1;467522186/SFB1557–Z2;""},{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF17OC0029432;""},{""name"":""German Academic Exchange Service"",""id"":""https://ror.org/039djdh30"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""57552340;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

These artifacts can affect demultiplexing accuracy and downstream analyses.

ResultsWe performed a rapid barcoding experiment on 66 diagnostic samples and found that 83% of reads carried the expected single-barcode pattern, while 17% contained multiple barcodes or other artifacts. Current demultiplexers, including the widely used Dorado, fail to correctly handle these complex cases, leaving approximately 7% of reads partially trimmed and contaminated with adapter fragments. Additional issues include the presence of two barcodes at the same read end--either identical, originating from the same sample, or different, introduced after pooling. The latter can lead to barcode bleeding when the outer barcode is incorrectly selected. To address these challenges, we developed Barbell, a pattern-aware demultiplexer that detects all barcode configurations. Barbell reduces trimming errors by three orders of magnitude, minimizes barcode bleeding, and supports custom experimental setups such as shorter barcodes, dual-end barcodes, and custom flank sequences.

ConclusionsOur results highlight the impact of complex barcode attachments in Nanopore sequencing and demonstrate that Barbell drastically reduces their effects on downstream analyses.

Quantitative binding assays define a minimal CTNIP4 region required for high-affinity HSL3 interaction and signaling activation. A 2.12 [A] crystal structure of the HSL3-CTNIP4 complex reveals a unique C-terminal receptor pocket that accommodates the peptides cyclic architecture through a combination of hydrophobic and polar contacts, a feature absent in the closely related HAE/HSL LRR-RKs. The cyclic CTNIP4 fold further establishes a largely hydrophobic interface that bridges HSL3 to the SERK co-receptor, forming a distinct activation surface.

Here, we introduce TF-MAPs, a scalable and general platform to chart complete functional maps of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. We apply TF-MAPS to three human disease TFs: HNF1A, FOXG1 and FOXP1. Allostery in all three proteins is distance-dependent, anisotropic, and couples the DNA-binding interface to the protein surface. The allosteric surfaces of FOXG1 and FOXP1 are quite diverged, revealing a potential for protein-specific regulation in protein families. All three TFs have potentially druggable pockets where mutations have strong functional effects on binding, either within the binding interface or distant from it. Using TF-MAPS it should be possible to chart functional and allosteric maps for hundreds of human TFs and other DNA-binding proteins to understand DNA recognition and TF regulation, to mechanistically interpret clinical variants, and to guide the development of TF-modulating therapeutics.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Sanger Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cy4wa09"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Grant reference: 220540/Z/20/A, ‘Wellcome Sanger Institute Quinquennial Review 2021-2026’;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Profiling 500,000 alleles across 74 cell types, scOUT-seq revealed that outcomes in most cell subtypes differ markedly from the bulk average. Various cell types shifted major repair classes, preferred different molecular sequences, and even enriched large structural variants, with distinctive patterns of allelic co-occurrence.

We isolated 184 microbes from wild Alaskan threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) guts across six lakes and screened for plastic degrading potential using lipase/esterase assays and biofilm formation on PET and PP.

Isolates with the highest plastic degrading potential were incubated in minimal media with PET or PP as the sole carbon source to determine whether plastic degradation potential is enhanced. Surface analysis identified a Pseudomonas trivialis strain that exhibited degradation of PP in monoculture; however, this activity was suppressed in the presence of another gut isolate, Pseudomonas germanica.

Acute stress is known to impact the hippocampus but may have opposite effects on these competing functions. That is, although stress impairs episodic encoding, it may instead enhance statistical learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how stress influences the hippocampal pathways and subfields that support episodic encoding and statistical learning while participants performed a task that engaged both processes. Across several analyses, stress biased hippocampal processing in favour of statistical learning, suppressing pattern separation between events in the dentate gyrus and enhancing the representation of statistically predictive features. Furthermore, stress drove the hippocampal monosynaptic pathway to support statistical learning rather than episodic encoding during predictive situations. Together, these data suggest that acute stress elicits targeted, adaptive changes in hippocampal pathways which may facilitate predicting and responding to upcoming events.","[{""name"":""NIMH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21MH128740;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

We find that only a subset of full promoters is activated by distal neuronal enhancers and that the promoter-proximal region is necessary for this enhancer-promoter compatibility. Core promoters alone are insufficient to respond to distal enhancers but modulate the transcriptional output of responsive promoters.

Here, we present a second high-quality Denisovan genome, reconstructed from a molar found at Denisova Cave. It belonged to a man who lived [~]200,000 years ago in a small Denisovan group. This group mixed with early Neandertals and was then replaced by Denisovans who had mixed with later Neandertals. We show that in addition Denisovans received gene flow from hominins that diverged before the split of the ancestors of Denisovans and modern humans. The two Denisovan genomes allow us to disentangle Denisovan ancestry in present-day humans revealing contributions from at least three distinct Denisovan groups. In particular, Oceanians and South Asians independently inherited DNA from a deeply diverged Denisovan population which was likely isolated in South Asia. This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route. Finally, the two high-quality Denisovan genomes allow us to refine the catalogue of genetic changes that arose on the Denisovan lineage, some of which were contributed to present-day humans.","[{""name"":""Max Planck Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01hhn8329"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""694707;""},{""name"":""Russian Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03y2gwe85"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""24-18-00069;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health appears to be unrelated to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Rather, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone.

Using GPX1 and GPX4, selenoenzymes that mitigate oxidative stress, as reporters, we performed genome-wide knockout screens to identify regulators of selenocysteine incorporation. This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate. Oxidative stress sensing by EEF1G slows translation, enhancing production of detoxifying selenoproteins to restore homeostasis. These findings reveal how programmed ribosome collisions enable gene regulation in response to stress.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA282036;U01CA305105;S10OD030312-01;""},{""name"":""Welch Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00np6vq88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""I-1961;""},{""name"":""Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0003xa228"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RP220309;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding. Our work reveals systems-level principles of the ubiquitinome and provides a powerful resource for studying protein ubiquitination.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

However, while considerable advances have been made in the de novo design of protein structure and function, the same has not yet been achieved for RNA tertiary structures of similar intricacy. Here, we describe a generative diffusion framework, RFDpoly, for generalized de novo biopolymer (RNA, DNA and protein) design, and use it to create diverse and designable RNA structures. We design RNA structures with novel folds and experimentally validate them using a combination of chemical footprinting (SHAPE-seq) and electron microscopy. We further use this approach to design protein-nucleic acid assemblies; the crystal structure of one such design is nearly identical to the design model. This work demonstrates that the principles of structure-based de novo protein design can be extended to nucleic acids, opening the door to creating a wide range of new RNA structures and protein-nucleic acid complexes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/051aqjh92"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Here, we characterize the tripartite symbiosis in a benthic dinoflagellate (Sinophysis sp.) using diverse single-cell methods. Sinophysis houses a photosynthetic cyanobacterium closely interacting with an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont. The cyanobacterium is in the intermediate stage of symbiont-to-organelle transition, with the host likely supporting it with metabolites and proteins, and controlling its cell division. Surprisingly, it seems to have replaced the hosts remnant non-photosynthetic plastid. Our results support mixotrophy, horizontal gene transfer, co-symbioses, and cell division control as early drivers of primary plastid origin and highlight the importance of protists for deciphering organellogenesis events.","[{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23K14256;23K05942;20K15856;""},{""name"":""Human Frontier Science Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGEC29/2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Sebum-based diagnostic methods using commercial oil-blotting films have been applied to SARS-CoV-2 detection in humans, yet equivalent strategies for veterinary use remain largely unexplored. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), presents a major health threat in Asia--especially in Japan, where multiple cases of cat-to-veterinarian transmission have been reported. To address the need for safer diagnostics, we sought to establish a sebum-based RNA virus detection method for cats. We designed primers that efficiently detected RNA from feline sebum while distinguishing it from human and feline DNA/RNA. Using this platform, we determined the ear to be the optimal sebum collection site and confirmed that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) RNA can be reliably identified from ear sebum with sensitivity comparable to conventional blood-based testing. In addition, we detected SFTSV RNA from sebum samples of infected cat. Our findings introduce a minimally invasive, safe diagnostic platform for feline viral infections, reducing animal distress while safeguarding veterinarians and pet owners from zoonotic risks. This strategy marks an important step toward realizing the One Health framework by advancing the well-being of both animals and humans.","[{""name"":""Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""G-7 Grants"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ito Foundation Research Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Kao Corporation (Japan)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/016t1kc57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761862207168

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.
