However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1751839781588

This rapid growth creates an urgent demand for novel search tools, as even the current fastest available methods like Foldseek face significant limitations in sensitivity and scalability when confronted with these massive repositories. To meet this challenge, we have developed SSAlign, a protein structure retrieval tool that leverages protein language models to jointly encode sequence and structural information, and adopts a two-stage alignment strategy optimized with multi-GPU and multi-process parallelization. On large-scale datasets such as AFDB50, SSAlign outpaces Foldseek by two to three orders of magnitude in search speed, offering unmatched scalability for high-throughput structural analysis. Compared to Foldseek, SSAlign retrieves substantially more high-quality matches on Swiss-Prot and achieves marked performance improvements on SCOPe40, with relative AUC increases of +20.2% at the family level and +33.3% at the superfamily level, demonstrating significantly enhanced sensitivity and recall. In sum, SSAlign achieves TM-align-comparable accuracy with Foldseek-surpassing speed and coverage, offering an efficient, sensitive, and scalable solution for large-scale structural biology and structure-based drug discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

We have previously shown that the transcription factor ADNP forms the ChAHP complex with the chromatin remodeler CHD4 and HP1 proteins, acting as a site-specific regulator of transcription and antagonist of CTCF binding. However, the molecular basis of these functions remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the CHD4 subunit is essential to antagonize CTCF and silence transcription of transposons, while HP1 proteins are dispensable. Although the remodeling activity of CHD4 is not required for ChAHP chromatin association, it is critical for both transposon repression and CTCF antagonism. Our findings support a model wherein ADNP recruits chromatin remodeling activity in a sequence-specific manner, enabling transcriptional control and local modulation of chromatin architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

By merging data from 58 such nanocrystals, we obtained diffraction to 0.85 A resolution with an overall correlation coefficient of over 99% and solved the structure ab initio using a five-residue helical fragment to initiate density modification. The resulting map was of exceptional quality, enabling fully automated model building and resolving individual hydrogen atoms.

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

Amvrakia, one of the main Corinthian colonies founded during the 7th century BCE, was characterized by its strong dependence on its metropolis. Here, we aim to investigate the genetic relationships between the Corinthian metropolis and the Amvrakia colony, the contribution of the local population to the founding genetic pool, as well as the demography of Amvrakia in subsequent periods. During its foundation in the Archaic period, Amvrakia appears to have been shaped by genetic influences from at least two different sources. The first source migrated from the Corinth territory, represented by the Archaic Tenea population and is supported via an Identity By Descent (IBD) analysis. The second source shows a direct ancestry from Late Bronze Age (LBA)/Iron Age Greece, including a local LBA population represented by the Ammotopos site located in close proximity to Amvrakia, as shown by a plethora of independent population genomics analyses. During the subsequent Classical and Hellenistic periods, the population of Amvrakia appears to have slightly differentiated, yet evidence of genetic continuity over time is observed. The migration of Corinthians to Amvrakia contributed to the initial genetic pool of the colony along with the local genetic pool, indicating that the Corinthian colonization included both genetic and cultural transmission between the metropolis and its colony.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

Despite an improved knowledge of the A. fumigatus genome, we still know little about the transcriptome, with key regulatory sequences like the untranslated regions of mRNA based only on in silico predictions and bulk-RNA-seq. Here, we provide an improved description of 5' and 3' untranslated regions of A. fumigatus poly(A)-enriched RNA through experimental mapping of transcription start sites and polyadenylation sites using 5' and 3' End-Seq. We assigned high-quality 5' ends to 2,747 genes (average length 126 nt), 3' ends to 7,079 genes (average length 268 nt), and improved our understanding of the regulatory landscape of A. fumigatus gene expression. We leveraged the refined 5' UTRs to identify upstream open reading frames and binding sites for important RNA binding proteins like the translational regulator Ssd1 and the 3' UTRs to define binding sites for PUF proteins known to contribute to mRNA localization and regulation. Although a single isoform typically dominated expression, we observed 148 instances of alternative start sites and 1,675 alternative stop sites. Interestingly, we detected multiple examples of premature transcriptional termination, including the first evidence for promoter-proximal premature transcriptional termination in a member of the Eurotiomycetes.

Here, we investigated the role of transcriptomic entropy in aging and cancer processes by analyzing RNA-sequencing data from thousands of human and mouse samples. We found that entropy changes during aging are highly tissue-specific, with some tissues showing increased entropy while others exhibit decreased or stable entropy levels. Transcriptomic entropy strongly correlates with age-related processes, showing positive associations with proliferation, cellular senescence, and somatic mutation burden, while negatively correlating with stemness. Surprisingly, cellular reprogramming also increases transcriptomic entropy. In cancer, we observed that primary tumors generally display higher entropy than normal tissue, with entropy levels further increasing in metastatic stages. Notably, treatment-resistant tumors showed distinct entropy patterns, with acquired resistance associated with increased entropy, while primary resistance and immediate post-treatment responses showed decreased entropy. Higher entropy levels predicted poor survival outcomes in multiple cancer types, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Furthermore, differential expression analysis revealed that entropy-associated genes are enriched in developmental processes and depleted in metabolic pathways, indicating a possible link to cellular dedifferentiation. Finally, we found increased entropy in various age-related diseases beyond cancer, suggesting that transcriptomic disorder may be a common feature in age-related pathologies. Our findings establish transcriptomic entropy as a fundamental parameter in aging and cancer progression, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and challenging the current view that increased disorder is always detrimental.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

However, it is unclear if ramping activity is related to the cognitive process of estimating time, or to other behavioral factors such as anticipating reward or regulating movements. Here, we harnessed two novel approaches to determine how these factors contribute to prefrontal and striatal ramping activity in mice performing an interval timing task. First, to determine how movement contributes to ramping activity, we tracked movement velocity using DeepLabCut as well as task-specific movements while recording prefrontal or striatal ensembles during interval timing. We found that time was more accurately decoded by ramping neurons than movement-modulated neurons, with the exception of prefrontal velocity-modulated neurons. Second, to disambiguate temporal signals from anticipatory reward signals we compared activity patterns in neurons that were recorded during interval timing to the same neurons recorded during a Pavlovian conditioning task. We found more ramping activity and more accurate temporal decoding by neuronal ensembles during interval timing compared to Pavlovian conditioning. Together, these data quantify contributions of time estimation, movement, and reward anticipation in prefrontal and striatal ensembles, and they suggest that ramping is a cognitive signal that estimates time. Our results provide insight into how prefrontal and striatal ensembles multiplex information to effect temporal control of action.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

The structure of maltose-binding protein (43 kDa) was determined at 2.32 [A] resolution, clearly revealing the bound maltose and water molecules. Additionally, the kinase domain of human PLK1 (37 kDa), slightly below the theoretical limit, was determined at 3.04 [A] resolution, allowing the identification of the bound ligand, onvansertib. These findings demonstrate that cryo-EM can be effectively employed for structure determination and structure-based drug screening of small proteins or domains.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

One of the examples of such positioning systems is the ParAB-parS which is responsible for plasmid and chromosome segregation. In Corynebacterium glutamicum, a parAB deletion results in cell division and growth defects, while deletion of an orphan ParA-like protein pldP results only in a moderate cell division phenotype. Having confirmed a basal ATPase activity of PldP, we aimed to explore if the {Delta}pldP-related phenotype could be a consequence of the mislocalized secreted proteins, as the loss of extracellular proteins involved in cell wall metabolism results in a similar phenotype characterized by disrupted separation of daughter cells. Putative peptidoglycan hydrolase Rv2525c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Rv2525c-like glycoside hydrolase-like domain-containing protein Cg0955 from C. glutamicum were previously shown to be transported outside of the cell by twin-arginine protein translocation machinery (Tat). Here, we found that although the deletion of pldP did not lead to the altered secretion of the putative hydrolase Cg0955 by the Tat system, it resulted in the reduction of the Tat dynamics. Our findings highlight the interplay between the ParA-like ATPase PldP and the Tat translocon and contribute to the studies of ParA-like proteins being essential in positioning various cargos in the bacterial cells.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

However, the full diversity of circulating strains and key reservoirs facilitating transmission within hospitals is unknown. We investigated the population structure and within-sample diversity of K. pneumoniae in a Malawian neonatal unit. We recruited 94 mother-neonate pairs and collected regular stool samples, hand swabs, cot swabs and swaddling cloth samples. Additionally, we collected ward surface-swab samples and staff hand swabs weekly. To establish within sample diversity we employed a dual sequencing approach; (i) single colony picks from Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase selective chromogenic agar for short-read whole genome sequencing; and (ii) post-enrichment metagenomics using plate sweeps from a non-selective agar. In total, we analysed 552 single-colony picks and 772 plate-sweeps from neonate, maternal and environmental samples. Comparing sequence types, surface antigens, antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, and plasmid replicons, between sample types and sequencing approaches, we identified key advantages and limitations of post-enrichment metagenomics. Our approach revealed high diversity at both the ward and individual level, with a high proportion of the overall diversity likely due to Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase negative organisms. ST15 and ST307 were found in high numbers using both methodologies, whilst ST14 was identified primarily from the non-selective post-enrichment metagenomic samples. Isolates and samples from ward surface swabs had more antimicrobial resistance genes and plasmid replicons than those isolated from human stool. This approach demonstrates the value of combining colony-based and metagenomic sequencing approaches, as a cost-effective alternative to shotgun metagenomics to study health care associated infections.","NA","medrxiv",1751839781588

Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and postnatal brain resulted in rich DNA-RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The two modalities concordance and distinction in spatial patterns highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics of both epigenome and transcriptome underlying mammalian embryogenesis, revealing details in sequence, cell type, and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation.

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) outbreaks are frequently caused by strains belonging to two phylogenetic lineages of the human-adapted strains of the Mtb Complex, namely lineages (L) 2 and L4. We hypothesized that members of L2 and L4 are more intrinsically drug tolerant, and as such, more readily evolve drug resistance. To explore this, we devised a high throughput in vitro assay to measure drug tolerance in Mtb. We selected a cohort of strains representative of the globally most frequent lineages L1-L4. We measured tolerance to rifampicin and bedaquiline and found L3 and L4 strains to have higher tolerance compared to L1 and L2 strains. In addition, phylogenetically closely related strains exhibited similar levels of tolerance, suggesting that tolerance is heritable. Finally, we explored genes previously reported to be associated with tolerance in Mtb and found significant enrichment in mutations in genes involved in cell wall and cell processes, intermediary metabolism and respiration, as well as lipid metabolism in high-tolerance strains.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

However, the regulatory logic and specific gene networks that define cell identities remain poorly resolved across the animal tree of life. As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures. To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer ontogenetic relationships among cell types. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types.

However, most current knowledge relies on studies of bulk tissue or isolated brain regions. Here, we present a large-scale single-cell analysis of transcriptomic sex differences in the human brain, using 169 samples from 15 females and 15 males across six cortical regions, selected based on in vivo neuroimaging measures of sex-biased volume. We find that sex effects on gene expression are highly patterned across cortical regions, cell types, and genes. They are most pronounced in: i) multiple cell types in the fusiform cortex (linked to male-biased volume and sex-biased behaviors); ii) oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and excitatory neurons across regions; and iii) a subset of sex chromosome and autosomal genes. Over 3,000 unique genes exhibit sex-biased expression, with 133 genes (119 autosomal) showing consistent sex differences across all region x cell type combinations. Sex chromosome genes show the largest sex differences in expression, driven by conserved X-Y gametologs, cell-type-specific biases in certain X- and Y-linked genes, and escape from X-inactivation - with the list of known escapees substantially expanded through our single-cell allele-specific expression analysis. Broader effects of sex on autosomal expression are captured in 13 core signatures with varying cell type vs. region specificity. These signatures are: i) shaped by regional differences in metabolism and laminar architecture; ii) enriched for diverse cellular compartments and biological processes; iii) regulated by sex steroids and X-linked transcription factors; and iv) linked to sex-specific genetic risk factors in sex-biased neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. This study substantially advances the breadth, depth, and granularity of knowledge on sex differences in the human brain, and provides a new open data resource to support future research.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

Its aberrant activation has been linked to many acute and chronic diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to Alzheimers disease and cancer, making NLRP3 an attractive therapeutic target. Here we report the discovery, characterization, and structure of an indazole-based NLRP3 antagonist, BAL-1516, which potently inhibits inflammasome formation in monocytes and microglia. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of BAL-1516 bound to NLRP3 reveals a previously undescribed compound binding site at a surface groove of the nucleotide-binding domain with contacts to the FISNA and WHD subdomains. The characteristic feature of BAL compound binding is the formation of three hydrogen bonds to the peripheral beta-strand of the triple-ATPase; two from the indazoles nitrogen atoms and a third from the compounds linker region. Additional phenyl and thiazole moieties render the compound hydrophobic, allowing excellent blood-brain barrier penetration.

The evolution of GP maps is particularly interesting in variable environments, as GP maps can evolve to bias variation in the direction of past selection, increasing the evolvability of the population over time. However, the degree and manner in which environmental variation shapes GP maps and influences evolutionary dynamics may depend on properties of the fitness landscape. To explore how evolutionary dynamics are affected by variable environments across a wide range of different pairs of fitness landscapes, we evolved GP maps to produce spatial-temporal gene expression patterns that matched two-dimensional patterns generated by different elementary cellular automata (CA) rules. We found remarkable variation in how populations evolved in variable environments. In some cases, changing the environment helped populations find higher fitness peaks; in others, it hindered them. The evolution of evolvability also depended on the fitness landscape pair. In some experiments, the ability to generate adaptive phenotypic variation upon environment change increased over time, while in some others, populations found shared areas between fitness landscapes. On the other hand, environmental variability consistently resulted in higher fitness landscape exploration, average fitness and mutational robustness compared to evolution in static environments, which we hypothesize are tightly connected. In conclusion, work presented here sheds light on important general consequences of environmental variability, while also demonstrating dependency on properties of fitness landscapes, which future research on the evolution of evolvability should consider.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

This heterogeneity is primarily attributed to genetic and molecular variations among individuals and their tumors. Understanding the impact of these differences on treatment outcomes is widely believed to be a key step for developing effective precision medicine strategies. However, the complexity of most biological pathways makes it difficult to predict the effect of genetic variation on cells and tissues, let alone predict a patient's response to therapy. As a result, high-throughput genetic and chemical perturbation screens have emerged as valuable tools for precision medicine-related tasks, such as disease modeling, target discovery, cellular programming, and pathway reconstruction. This approach is fundamentally limited, however, because the number of possible combinations of cell types, cell states, perturbation targets, and perturbation types is huge and cannot be exhaustively tested experimentally. This calls for computational approaches that can simulate such experiments in silico, guiding in vitro experiments towards perturbations that are more likely to produce the desired effect. Here we describe OmniPert, a novel generative AI tool, which utilizes a deep learning, transformer-based architecture to model the effects of genetic and chemical perturbations on single-cell transcriptomes. Trained on millions of diverse cellular profiles, this approach allows for more granular analysis of cellular responses, thereby facilitating downstream applications in cell-specific gene-gene and gene-drug interaction networks, biomarker and drug target discovery, drug repurposing, and in silico perturbation reverse-engineering.

The developmental and metabolic aspects of trichomes have not been studied in banana (Musa acuminata). In the present study, we report that banana cultivars with AAA genome contain trichomes on inflorescence stalk. Transcriptome analysis of epidermal tissues of trichome-rich and trichome-free banana cultivars suggested that genes concerning defence response and specialized metabolism are differentially regulated. Based on the gene expression and phylogenetic analysis, two transcription factors, MaTFR (trichome and flavonol related R2R3-MYB) and MaHDZIV6 (HDZIP-IV), were identified as candidate regulators of trichome development. Both genes partially complemented the glabrous phenotype of trichome-related mutants of Arabidopsis. Transient overexpression and silencing in banana embryogenic cells (ECS) suggested that both MaTFR and MaHDZIV6 regulate the transcription of flavonol biosynthesis genes and modulate flavonoids content. Furthermore, MaTFR was found to directly activate the expression of MaHDZIV6. Trichome-enriched cultivars have enhanced active JA content compared to trichome-free cultivar suggesting the involvement of JA signalling in regulating trichome development. Two JAZ repressors, MaJAZ5 and MaJAZ8 interacted with MaTFR and attenuated the flavonoid biosynthesis.

Most high-performance demonstrations have used silicon microelectrode ""Utah"" arrays to record brain activity at single neuron resolution. However, reports so far have typically been limited to one or two individuals, with no systematic assessment of the longevity, decoding accuracy, and day-to-day stability properties of chronically implanted Utah arrays. Here, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 20 years of neural data from the BrainGate and BrainGate2 pilot clinical trials. This dataset spans 2,319 recording sessions and 20 arrays from the first 14 participants in these trials. On average, arrays successfully recorded neural spiking waveforms on 35.6% of electrodes, with only a 7% decline over the study enrollment period (up to 7.6 years, with a mean of 2.8 years). We assessed movement intention decoding performance using a ""decoding signal-to-noise ratio"" (dSNR) metric, and found that 11 of 14 arrays provided meaningful movement decoding throughout study enrollment (dSNR > 1). Three arrays reached a peak dSNR greater than 4.5, approaching that achieved during able-bodied computer mouse control (6.29). We also found that dSNR increases logarithmically with the number of electrodes, providing a pathway for scaling performance. Longevity and reliability of Utah array recordings in this study were better than in prior nonhuman primate studies. However, achieving peak performance consistently will require addressing unknown sources of variability.","NA","medrxiv",1751839781588

In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of the nightshade seed fossil record, which corresponds to the largest amount of fossil material for the family despite having relatively few described taxa. We re-examined 110 fossil seeds previously assigned either to one of the six taxa or unplaced within the family. All fossils were imaged and measured for 14 discrete and continuous characters, and a subset of 22 well-preserved specimens was additionally subjected to micro-CT scanning. In parallel, we scored the same set of characters for seeds from 354 extant taxa of Solanaceae. We carried out a multivariate analysis of the combined extinct and extant dataset to visualize the placement of fossil seeds within Solanaceae seed morphospace. This analysis revealed a wide spread of fossils across morphospace, including a variety of shapes, sizes and testal wall features. For one fossil taxon (Hyoscyosperma daturoides Deanna & S.D.Sm. gen. et sp. nov.), the micro-CT images confirmed the presence of an elaiosome, otherwise only known in the family from the genus Datura L. Based on these analyses, we re-circumscribe three species and describe six new taxa (four in new genera), doubling the number of fossil seed species in the family. The broad geographic and stratigraphic distribution of these diverse taxa, from Eocene North America and Europe to Pleistocene Eurasia, support the notion that the Solanaceae is likely a family of a late Cretaceous origin that attained nearly a cosmopolitan distribution by the Eocene.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

This bias may emerge at multiple stages of the reconstruction pipeline, and in particular in the critical particle-picking stage, where 2D particles (in cryo-EM) or 3D subtomograms (in cryo-ET) are extracted from highly noisy micrographs or tomograms. Focusing on two widely used methodologies, template matching and deep neural networks, we combine theoretical analysis with controlled experiments to demonstrate that both methods, when applied to pure noise, can produce persistent molecular structures, a phenomenon we term structure from noise. This artifact highlights a critical vulnerability in current workflows: the potential for particle-picking algorithms to inject strong prior-driven bias into downstream analyses. We then propose practical mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of such biases. Together, our findings deepen the theoretical understanding of confirmation bias in cryo-EM and cryo-ET and call for cautious interpretation of reconstructions, primarily when relying on template-driven particle picking.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

We observed that p53 R273H mutation associates with a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) state and metastatic progression. In vitro ChIP-seq experiments conducted on p53R27H harbouring HT29 cells revealed an enrichment of mutant p53 R273H at pEMT or mesenchymal gene sets. Further, simulations from a gene regulatory network incorporating the interactions of p53R273H with EMT regulators explain how this mutation shapes the phenotypic landscape accessible to cancer cells. Finally, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of colorectal tumours reveals R273H-linked enrichment of partial and mesenchymal EMT phenotypes across tumour subpopulations in CRC. Overall, we identified distinct epigenetic regulation regulating partial EMT and consequent aggressive behaviour triggered by p53R273H.

To date, the EBG has been used to assess how the OB process odor identity, valence, intensity, and it has shown promise as an early biomarker for Parkinson's disease. However, current implementation of the EBG method depends on several methodological components, including subject specific co-registration of electrode positions through neuronavigation and EEG source reconstruction, which may limit accessibility for many research groups. In this study, we test the quality and reliability of the OB signal under different configurations to potentially remedy this. Specifically, we compare six EBG setups that vary in the use of subject-specific T1 scans versus a template head model, co-registered versus template electrode positions, and individualized versus template-based OB location. Our results indicate that strongest EBG signals are obtained when using subject-specific T1 scans in combination with co-registered electrode positions. However, we obtained significant EBG activity even when using a fully template-based configuration. Our anatomical analysis of OB location of 941 individuals reveals that in 86% of cases, the OB is centered within the spatial resolution bounds of the EEG source dipole, supporting the feasibility of detecting olfactory bulb signals without precise individual anatomical mapping using template coordinates. These findings suggest that while subject-specific configurations enhance signal quality, the EBG method remains robust enough to yield meaningful results even with less complex setups. This enables a broader adoption of the EBG method in both clinical and research settings.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

This study aims to measure the force exerted by the kinesin-3 motor protein KIF1A, mutations of which cause KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND) and are associated with reduced force and motility. Unlike kinesin-1, KIF1A detaches easily under perpendicular loads, which can occur in optical tweezers experiments.

A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endoreplicate throughout the flys life, increasing their ploidy and cell volume, while at the same time nearby cells are lost into the gut lumen in an age-dependent process. These cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when endocycling in these cells is experimentally increased or decreased, nuclear and cellular volume as well as peritrophic membrane synthesis is concomitantly enhanced or reduced. Further, we show that blocking endocycling in these cells leads to functional defects in the peritrophic membrane, ultimately leading to increased susceptibility to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function over the course of the adult lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

DesignNationally-representative household survey, January-March 2025.

SettingGreat Britain.

Participants5,893 adults ([&ge;]18y).

Main outcome measuresParticipants were asked whether they had used medication in the past year to manage type 2 diabetes (excluding insulin), reduce the risk of heart disease, or support weight loss and, if so, whether they had used five specific GLP1-RAs. Those who had not used medication to support weight loss in the past year were asked how likely they would be to consider doing so in the next year. Estimates were reported stratified by participant characteristics and extrapolated to the national population.

ResultsOverall, 2.9% [2.4-3.4%] - [~]1.6 million adults - reported using a GLP-1RA to support weight loss in the past year, with 1.7% [1.4-2.1%] ([~]910,000 adults) using them exclusively for this purpose. The majority of those who used them exclusively for weight loss (91.4% [85.6-97.2%]) reported using GLP-1RAs that are licensed for this purpose in Great Britain, most commonly Mounjaro (tirzepatide; 80.2% [71.9-88.6%]). Of those who had not used weight-loss medication in the past year, 6.5% [5.7-7.3%] ([~]3.3 million adults) expressed an interest in doing so in the next year. Use and interest were more prevalent among women, people in mid-life, and those reporting past-month psychological distress. Interest was also higher among people facing greater socioeconomic disadvantage, including those in financial difficulty or unemployed due to long-term illness or disability.

ConclusionsIn the first quarter of 2025, 4.2 million adults in Great Britain - nearly one in ten - either had recently used a GLP-1RA to support weight loss or were interested in doing so in the near future. A substantial minority reported using a type of GLP-1RA that was not licensed for weight management, suggesting off-label use. Interest was particularly high among less advantaged socioeconomic groups, while use was similar across groups, highlighting the importance of addressing equity in access. These findings underscore the need to monitor who is accessing these medications and to ensure their safe, appropriate, and equitable provision.

While prior work has shown that tool use alters body representation, little is known about how artificial augmentations alter body representations as they are worn and used. Here, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built exoskeletal device that extended users fingers by 10 cm. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after exoskeleton wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, simply wearing the exoskeleton led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, following active use, both biological and artificial finger representations expanded significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a lasting aftereffect on biological finger representation was observed even after device removal. Our findings demonstrate that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into the body representation, with dynamic adjustments in proprioceptive space shaped by both structural and functional properties of the device. This work advances our understanding of how the sensorimotor system accommodates artificial extensions and highlights the potential for body- augmenting technologies to be intuitively integrated into body representation. These results have direct implications for the design of prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other assistive technologies aimed at extending human physical capacity.

Significance statementHow do wearable augmentations reshape our sense of the body? Using a custom- built exoskeleton that extended the fingers, we tracked changes in body representation across four stages of wear and use. We found that the sensorimotor system rapidly integrates artificial extensions into its somatosensory map: first contracting, then expanding perceived finger length in response to structure and function, with the shifts persisting after device removal. Our findings reveal dynamic, use-dependent plasticity in body representation, which has direct relevance for designing prosthetics, exoskeletons, and assistive devices.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

They are used to treat metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer, but resistance is common, and this has been associated with TP53 loss and senescence evasion. We show here that enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells that evade senescence mis-segregate chromosomes due to defective chromosomal alignment and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, leading to aneuploidy and DNA damage. The chromosome alignment errors are associated with impaired Sgo1 localisation to centromeres and defective sister chromatin cohesion during mitosis. Importantly, all these mitotic defects can be rescued by constraining cell size during the CDK4/6i-treatment, and specifically restoring cohesion rescues the chromosome segregation errors. Together, this demonstrates mechanistically how cell enlargement drives genetic and karyotypic change in cells that re-enter the cell cycle following CDK4/6 inhibition. This could help fuel the rapid emergence of chemotherapy-resistant clones, especially in p53-null cells that evade senescence to drive drug-resistance in patients.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

To better understand the diversity, roles, and evolution of bacterial introns, we focused on tRNA introns and analyzed Patescibacteria complete genome. Notably, 20% of these genomes lacked at least one tRNA gene for a canonical amino acid, primarily tRNAAsn and tRNAAsp, whereas other tRNA genes were readily detected. This observation led us to conduct further analyses, resulting in the discovery of a novel group I intron insertion site at position 35/36 within the anticodon loop that likely prevented detection by conventional annotation tools. Splicing assays demonstrated that these bacterial introns are catalytically active and capable of self-splicing. To assess the broader distribution of this insertion site across bacteria, we analyzed 4,934 bacterial genomes and identified 269 group I introns within tRNA genes across 14 phyla. Nearly 70% of introns at position 35/36 originate from Patescibacteria, indicating that this feature is largely confined to the phylum. Subgroup classification showed that 79% of all tRNA introns belonged to the IC subgroup, whereas almost all Patescibacteria introns were assigned to IA, suggesting a distinct evolutionary origin. As most tRNA introns lacked homing endonuclease genes, horizontal transfer appears limited. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of bacterial group I introns in tRNAs, with particular emphasis on Patescibacteria. IMPORTANCE Group I introns in bacterial tRNA genes were previously known only in a limited number of phyla. Our study expands this knowledge by identifying a novel insertion position in tRNA genes of phylum Patescibacteria and mapping their phylogenetic distribution across bacterial lineages. Our result revealed that group I introns inserted in tRNA genes differed in subgroups between Patescibacteria and other bacteria, highlighting the evolutionary uniqueness of introns of Patescibacteria. Additionally, we found that group I introns are maintained in 43% of bacterial phyla, with tRNA insertions being the most common. Our findings highlight that even in complete genomes, the presence of group I introns can hinder the detection of all 20 canonical tRNA genes by conventional tRNA annotation tools. This study illustrates the overlooked phylogenetic distribution of group I introns across the bacterial domain.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

SINEs retain sequence features recognized by the POL III machinery and constitute a substantial portion of vertebrate genomes. Despite their impact on genome stability and evolution, the mechanisms governing SINE transcription remain poorly understood. Although DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation have been implicated in their repression, we find these pathways play only a minor role in mouse embryonic stem cells. Instead, we identify the ChAHP complex as a key repressor of SINE B2 elements. ChAHP directly inhibits POL III transcription by blocking TFIIIB recruitment without affecting TFIIIC binding. This selective interference prevents transcription initiation and highlights a distinct regulatory mechanism. Our findings establish ChAHP as a non-canonical repressor of POL III-dependent SINE transcription, offering new insights into the control of this pervasive class of non-coding genomic elements.","NA","biorxiv",1751839781588

However, their contents, functions, and evolutionary mechanisms remain unclear. We performed comparative genomics on long-read assembled GRCs from male House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), Common Rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus), and Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), the first two of which are newly presented and annotated here. These long-read GRCs are repeat-rich (63-74%), despite their wide variation in size (16-160 megabases), individually distinct gene content, and variable evolutionary histories. These GRCs have accumulated intact long terminal repeat (LTR) endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and their proliferation co-occurs with speciation events of passerine birds. In contrast, normal chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes) are known to purge ERVs through ectopic recombination of LTRs that generate solo LTRs. Furthermore, transcriptomic data reveal significantly higher ERV transcription on GRCs than on A-chrs in House Finch testis. We propose that GRCs act as reservoirs of active ERVs, promoting germline transposition and potentially accelerating adaptation and speciation. This study suggests that GRCs play an indispensable role and likely contribute to adaptive diversification in birds.

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1751839781588

MethodsThis in vitro study used sixty dental enamel specimens, divided into 12 groups: traditional Red Bull(R) energy drink modified with three concentrations each of calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex (0.71, 1.43, and 2.15g), dicalcium malate (0.83, 1.66, and 2.50g), and calcium citrate malate (1.26, 2.53, and 3.80g); unmodified traditional Red Bull(R) energy drink; deionized water; and commercially available calcium-supplemented Life Mix Baixa Caloria(R) orange juice. The pH of all drinks was measured using a pHmeter. Specimens were exposed to the drinks for two minutes. Surface roughness and microhardness were assessed before and after exposure using a rugosimeter and a Vickers microhardness tester, respectively.

ResultsThe addition of calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex increased the energy drinks pH proportionally to the concentration added. Specimens exposed to modified drinks showed reduced roughness (p < 0.004) compared to control drinks. Drinks modified with 2.50g of dicalcium malate and 2.15g of the calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex significantly preserved enamel microhardness (p < 0.004) compared to the unmodified energy drink. Across all modifications, enamel surface microhardness loss was lower than in control groups, except for deionized water.

ConclusionThe addition of calcium formulations to the energy drink effectively reduced its erosive potential at all concentrations, with the calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex demonstrating the greatest protective effect.","NA","medrxiv",1751839781588

We analysed genotype array and exome sequence data from two birth cohorts (Millenium Cohort Study and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; n=5,320-8,622) to assess common and rare variant contributions to internalising and externalising symptoms across development. For both symptom domains, we identified associations with several polygenic indices (PGIs) that generally remained stable across development. For externalising symptoms, many of these associations reflected direct genetic effects. Concordant results were observed in the Born in Bradford cohort. A higher exome-wide burden of deleterious rare variants was associated with increased externalising (p-adj<0.03) and internalising symptoms (p-adj<0.01); trio models indicated direct genetic effects on externalising in MCS (p<0.05; p-adj>0.05) and on internalising symptoms in ALSPAC (p-adj<0.02). Common and rare genetic variants contributed independently, jointly explaining 2% of the variance in internalising and 5-7% in externalising symptoms. Finally, we show that the direct genetic effects of several PGIs and of deleterious rare variants on adolescent mental health are mediated by childhood externalising behaviours and/or cognitive ability.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit their adoption in healthcare settings.

ObjectiveTo develop and evaluate a privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the browser.

MethodsWe fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140 modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple clinical quality dimensions.

ResultsThe fine-tuned OnDevice model demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1 improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13 to 4.43 (+41.5%).

ConclusionsFine-tuning compact LLMs for medical transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility for resource-constrained environments.","NA","medrxiv",1751839781588

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

Despite numerous studies, an existing knowledge lacuna in the role of AP-3 in DCV function prompted us to delve deeper. Advanced microscopy and biochemical analysis revealed compromised DCV exocytosis in AP-3-depleted PC12 cells and C. elegans. AP-3 depletion altered the size and positioning of DCVs. Golgi defects and RUSH (Retention under Selective Hook) substantiated the role of AP-3 in trans-Golgi DCV budding. Proteomics revealed the loss of specific known and putative novel DCV proteins, which were mislocalized and rerouted to lysosomes in AP-3-depleted cells. Bioinformatics, Proximity ligation assays and Co-immunoprecipitation identified interactions of mislocalized proteins with AP-3 subunit. These findings corroborated with functional defects in granule maturation, release modes, Zinc and neurotransmitter mobilisation. Our study highlights the complexity of the AP-3 complex in regulating DCV function and its importance in vesicle transport in neurons and neuroendocrine cells.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1751839781588

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1751839781588

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1751839781588
