We introduce an approach for multispectral imaging in live cells, comprising an iterative spectral unmixing algorithm and eight channel camera-based image acquisition hardware. This enables the accurate unmixing of low signal-to-noise ratio datasets, typical of live-cell imaging, captured at video rates. We use this approach on a commercial spinning disk confocal microscope and a home-built oblique plane light sheet microscope to image 1-7 spectrally distinct fluorophore species simultaneously, using both fluorescent protein fusions and small-molecule dyes. We further use de novo designed protein-binding proteins (minibinders), labelled with organic fluorophores, and use these in combination with our multispectral imaging approach to study the endosomal trafficking of cell-surface receptors at endogenous levels.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Tyrannosaurus rex top speeds have been examined using a wide range of methods that draw on more traditional biomechanical formulas, computer simulations, and allometric equations based on mass. However, these calculations may be made more precise using input from contemporary research on anatomy and biomechanics that account for mass allometry and scaling. This study builds on existing studies in anatomy, biomechanical data, and established equations for locomotion to calculate a muscular driven range of top speed for several (n=4) specimens that had sufficient data to undertake this work. When properly refined with additional data on muscle mass allometry and scaling, several adult specimens of T. rex could confidently be placed in a range of top speed from 7.7 to 10.5 m/s, and possibly up to 10.7 m/s. Additionally, a younger specimen of T. rex was analyzed and found to have a higher top speed than the adult T. rex at 6.3 to 14.5 m/s. Although the estimated top speeds in this study are slower than some previous estimates, these results find some support for slow running gaits and reinforce interpretations of T. rex as an active and effective apex predator. Future work can build upon this study by investigating how muscular driven top speeds may affect ontogenetic niche partitioning and prey species regularly targeted by adult T. rex.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

However, despite its dynamic history, the critical area between the Greater and Lesser Caucasus mountain ranges, mainly corresponding to modern-day Georgia, has received limited attention. Here, we generated an ancient DNA time transect consisting of 219 individuals with genome-wide data from 47 sites in this region, supplemented by 97 new radiocarbon dates. Spanning from the Early Bronze Age 5000 years ago to the so-called ""Migration Period"" that followed the fall of the Western Roman Empire, we document a largely persisting local gene pool that continuously assimilated migrants from Anatolia/Levant and the populations of the adjacent Eurasian steppe. More specifically, we observe these admixture events as early as the Middle Bronze Age. Starting with Late Antiquity (late first century AD), we also detect an increasing number of individuals with more southern ancestry, more frequently associated with urban centers - landmarks of the early Christianization in eastern Georgia. Finally, in the Early Medieval Period starting 400 AD, we observe genetic outlier individuals with ancestry from the Central Eurasian steppe, with artificial cranial deformations (ACD) in several cases. At the same time, we reveal that many individuals with ACD descended from native South Caucasus groups, indicating that the local population likely adopted this cultural practice.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

The rapid structural changes seen in plasmid genomes present considerable challenges to evolutionary and epidemiological analysis. Typical approaches are either low resolution (replicon typing) or use shared k-mer content to define a genetic distance. However this distance can both overestimate plasmid relatedness by ignoring rearrangements, and underestimate by over-penalising gene gain/loss. Therefore a model is needed which captures the key components of how plasmid genomes evolve structurally - through gene/block gain or loss, and rearrangement. A secondary requirement is to prevent promiscuous transposable elements (TEs) leading to over-clustering of unrelated plasmids. We choose the ""Double Cut and Join Indel"" model, in which plasmids are studied at a coarse level, as a sequence of signed integers (representing genes or aligned blocks), and the distance between two plasmids is the minimum number of rearrangement events or indels needed to transform one into the other. We show how this gives much more meaningful distances between plasmids. We introduce a software workflow pling (https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/pling), which uses the DCJ-Indel model, to calculate distances between plasmids and then cluster them. In our approach, we combine containment distances and DCJ-Indel distances to build a TE-aware plasmid network. We demonstrate superior performance and interpretability to other plasmid clustering tools on the ""Russian Doll"" dataset and a hospital transmission dataset.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

In the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), fast oscillations (sharp-wave ripples) during non-REM sleep consolidate spatial memories through place cell reactivation. The hippocampal formation is heterogeneous; the dHPC processes mostly contextual information, while the ventral part (vHPC) encodes valence and anxiety. We propose that dorsal-ventral communication during sleep is involved in the consolidation of emotional memories, potentially integrating or segregating contextual and valence information. To test this, we recorded the electrophysiological activity in the dHPC and vHPC in rats during reward and aversion-motivated exploration of a linear track and subsequent sleep. We detected dorsal and ventral SWRs during NREM sleep as well as neuronal assemblies during each exploration type and identified dorsal, ventral, and joint (dorso-ventral) assemblies. We found that dorso-ventral hippocampal coordination involves coordinated ripples and bursts of ripples. Aversive joint assemblies exhibited higher reactivation during non-REM sleep than the joint assemblies from the reward condition. Interestingly, joint aversive assemblies reactivated selectively during dorso-ventral coordinated ripples. Furthermore, their reactivation strength positively correlated with their strength of activation during the task. These results suggest the existence of dorsal-ventral hippocampal functional communication capable of sustaining the selective reactivation of experiences based on their emotional valence.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

While oral NR supplementation has demonstrated safety and bioavailability in multiple animal and human studies, the effects of intravenous NR (NR IV) are far less understood. Until now, pharmaceutical grade NR was not available for injection research.

ObjectivesGiven that intravenous administration may offer advantages in certain conditions and contexts, a systematic investigation of the clinical effects of NR IV is warranted.

MethodsThe present randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical study was initiated with the primary aim of investigating the safety, tolerability, and the blood NAD+-boosting efficacy of an acute, single dose of NR IV (500 mg, test), NAD+ IV (500 mg, active comparator), oral NR (500 mg, bridge), and saline IV (placebo control) in generally healthy adult participants. The study consisted of two parts; data from 37 and 16 participants in the first and second phases, respectively, were analyzed.

ResultsNo significant differences in vital signs were detected across groups. In comparison to NAD+ IV, NR IV was associated with fewer and less severe adverse experiences during the infusion; no attributable adverse events were reported through the 14-day follow-up period for any treatment groups. Further, the mean tolerable infusion time for NR IV was 75% less than that of NAD+ IV. No clinically meaningful changes in blood chemistry markers were described in the NR IV condition, whereas an increase in white blood cell counts and neutrophils was observed in the NAD+ IV condition, suggesting the presence of an inflammatory response. Finally, NR IV appeared to promote the most robust increases in NAD+ concentration as measured by dried blood spot analyses, with peak NAD+ levels increasing by 20.7% relative to baseline, and acutely outperforming NAD+ IV (p <0.01) and oral NR (p<0.01) at the 3-hr timepoint.

ConclusionThis is the first study to clinically evaluate NR IV. Overall, acute intravenous infusions of 500 mg NR were safe in the study participants with no attributable adverse events and only minor and transient infusion-related experiences. In comparison to NAD+ IV, NR IV had a faster infusion time with superior tolerability. At 3 hours post-infusion, blood NAD+ levels were significantly higher in the NR IV group compared to the NAD+ IV group. Future studies in larger populations are needed to validate these results.","NA","medrxiv",1718402772461

Furthermore, the HD system developed a unique mapping between its internal organization and spatial orientation in each environment. This was not affected by visits to other environments and was stabilized with experience. These findings demonstrate that stable neuronal code supports the sense of direction and forms long-lasting orientation memories.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

By studying these forces in adherent cells in culture, we found that neither pushing nor pulling forces propagate along microtubules to the centrosome. Inhibiting dyneins or disassembling microtubules did not disrupt the maintenance of the centrosome at the center of the cell. In contrast, the actomyosin contractile network appears to be responsible for the generation of a centripetal flow that drives the centrosome towards the center of the cell independently of the microtubules. Furthermore, we found that centering of the centrosome depends more on the reorganization of cell shape around the centrosome than on an effective centrosome displacement throughout the cytoplasm. Interestingly, despite their lack of mechanical role, microtubules appear to direct this remodeling of cell shape. This revised view of centrosome positioning offers a new perspective for understanding the establishment of cell polarity.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

We therefore created ""Phollow"": a live imaging-based approach for tracking phage replication and spread in situ with single-virion resolution. Combining Phollow with optically transparent zebrafish enabled us to directly visualize phage outbreaks within the vertebrate gut. We observed that virions can be rapidly taken up by intestinal tissues, including by enteroendocrine cells, and quickly disseminate to extraintestinal sites, including the liver and brain. Moreover, antibiotics trigger waves of interbacterial transmission leading to sudden shifts in spatial organization and composition of defined gut communities. Phollow ultimately empowers multiscale investigations connecting phage transmission to transkingdom interactions that have the potential to open new avenues for viral-based microbiome therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Microviruses are highly abundant in aquatic ecosystems and are prominent members of the mammalian gut microbiome, where their diversity has been linked to various chronic health disorders. Despite the clear importance of microviruses, little is known about the molecular mechanism of host infection. Here, we have characterized an exceptionally large microvirus, Ebor, and provide crucial insights into long-standing mechanistic questions. Cryogenic electron microscopy of Ebor revealed a capsid with trimeric protrusions that recognise lipopolysaccharides on the host surface. Cryogenic electron tomography of the host cell colonized with virus particles demonstrated that the virus initially attaches to the cell via five such protrusions, located at the corners of a single pentamer. This interaction triggers a stargate mechanism of capsid opening along the 5-fold symmetry axis, enabling delivery of the virus genome. Despite variations in specific virus-host interactions among different Microviridae family viruses, structural data indicate that the stargate mechanism of infection is universally employed by all members of the family. Startlingly, our data reveal a mechanistic link for the opening of relatively small capsids made out of a single jelly-roll fold with the structurally unrelated giant viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

While established viability-resolved metagenomic approaches are labor-intensive as well as biased and lacking in sensitivity, we here introduce a new fully computational framework that leverages nanopore sequencing technology to assess microbial viability directly from freely available nanopore signal data. Our approach utilizes deep neural networks to learn features from such raw nanopore signal data that can distinguish DNA from viable and dead microorganisms in a controlled experimental setting. The application of explainable AI tools then allows us to robustly pinpoint the signal patterns in the nanopore raw data that allow the model to make viability predictions at high accuracy. Using the model predictions as well as efficient explainable AI-based rules, we show that our framework can be leveraged in a real-world application to estimate the viability of pathogenic Chlamydia, where traditional culture-based methods suffer from inherently high false negative rates. This application shows that our viability model captures predictive patterns in the nanopore signal that can in principle be utilized to predict viability across taxonomic boundaries and indendent of the killing method used to induce bacterial cell death. While the generalizability of our computational framework needs to be assessed in more detail, we here demonstrate for the first time the potential of analyzing freely available nanopore signal data to infer the viability of microorganisms, with many applications in environmental, veterinary, and clinical settings.

Author summaryMetagenomics investigates the entirety of DNA isolated from an environment or a sample to holistically understand microbial diversity in terms of known and newly discovered microorganisms and their ecosystem functions. Unlike traditional culturing of microorganisms, metagenomics is not able to differentiate between viable and dead microorganisms since DNA might readily persist under different environmental circumstances. The viability of microorganisms is, however, of importance when making inferences about a microorganisms metabolic potential, a pathogens virulence, or an entire microbiomes impact on its environment. As existing viability-resolved metagenomic approaches are labor-intensive, expensive, and lack sensitivity, we here investigate our hypothesis if freely available nanopore sequencing signal data, which captures DNA molecule information beyond the DNA sequence, might be leveraged to infer such viability. This hypothesis assumes that DNA from dead microorganisms accumulates certain damage signatures that reflect microbial viability and can be read from nanopore signal data using fully computational frameworks. We here show first evidence that such a computational framework might be feasible by training a deep model on controlled experimental data to predict viability at high accuracy, exploring what the model has learned, and applying it to an independent real-world dataset of an infectious pathogen. While the generalizability of this computational framework needs to be assessed in much more detail, we demonstrate that freely available data might be usable for relevant viability inferences in environmental, veterinary, and clinical settings.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments often form during early mitosis, but are destabilized through the phosphorylation of outer kinetochore proteins by centromeric AURORA B kinase (ABK) and centrosomal AURORA A kinase (AAK), thus allowing for re-establishment of attachments until biorientation is achieved. MPS1-mediated phosphorylation of NDC80 has also been shown to directly weaken the kinetochore-microtubule interface in yeast. In human cells, MPS1 has been proposed to transiently accumulate at end-on attached kinetochores and phosphorylate SKA3 to promote microtubule release. Whether MPS1 directly targets NDC80 and/or promotes the activity of AURORA kinases in metazoans remains unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism involving communication between kinetochores and centrosomes, wherein MPS1 acts upstream of AAK to promote error correction. MPS1 on pole-proximal kinetochores phosphorylates the C-lobe of AAK thereby increasing its activation at centrosomes. This proximity-based activation ensures the establishment of a robust AAK activity gradient that locally destabilizes mal-oriented kinetochores near spindle poles. Accordingly, MPS1 depletion from Drosophila cells causes severe chromosome mis-alignment and erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which can be rescued by tethering either MPS1 or constitutively active AAK mutants to centrosomes. Proximity-based activation of AAK by MPS1 also occurs in human cells to promote AAK-mediated phosphorylation of the NDC80 N-terminal tail. These findings uncover an MPS1-AAK cross-talk that is required for efficient error correction, showcasing the ability of kinetochores to modulate centrosome outputs to ensure proper chromosome segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Here, we identify a novel stress response pathway activated by mitochondrial damage that regulates mitophagy in neurons. We find that increasing levels of mitochondrial stress triggers a graded, concerted response that induces proteasomal degradation of negative regulators of autophagy. These include Myotubularin-related phosphatase 5 (MTMR5), MTMR2 and Rubicon. This Mitophagic Stress Response (MitoSR) pathway is neuron-specific and acts in parallel to the classical Pink1/Parkin mediated mitophagy pathway. While MTMR5/MTMR2 inhibits autophagosome biogenesis, we find that Rubicon inhibits lysosomal function and thus blocks autophagosome maturation. Targeted depletion of these negative regulators is sufficient to enhance mitophagy, promoting autophagosome biogenesis and facilitating the fusion of mitophagosomes with lysosomes. Our work suggests that therapeutic activation of the MitoSR pathway to induce degradation of negative regulators of autophagy may enhance mitochondrial quality control in stressed neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

In two EEG studies on somatosensory near-threshold detection, we investigated the pre-stimulus neural correlates of an (implicit) previous choice bias and an explicit bias. The explicit bias was introduced by informing participants about stimulus probability on a single-trial level (volatile context) or block-wise (stable context). Behavioural analysis confirmed adjustments in the decision criterion and confidence ratings according to the cued probabilities and previous choice-induced biases. Pre-stimulus beta power with distinct sources in sensory and higher-order cortical areas predicted explicit and implicit biases, respectively, on a single subject level and partially mediated the impact of previous choice and stimulus probability on the detection response. We suggest that pre-stimulus beta oscillations in different brain areas are neural correlates of explicit and implicit biases in somatosensory perception.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

However, there are more observable biomechanical compensation strategies within TUG that are indicative of underlying neuromuscular issues and movement priorities. In individuals with unilateral knee osteoarthritis, an increased trunk flexion during TUG is a common phenomenon, often attributed to muscle weakness and/or pain avoidance. Unfortunately, it is difficult to differentiate between these underlying causes using experimental studies alone. This study aimed to distinguish between muscle weakness and pain avoidance as contributing factors, using predictive neuromuscular simulations of the sit-to-walk movement. Muscle weakness was simulated by reducing the maximum isometric force of the vasti muscles (ranging from 20% to 60%), while pain avoidance was integrated as a movement objective, ensuring that peak knee load did not exceed predefined thresholds (2-4 times body weight). The simulations demonstrate that a decrease in muscular capacity led to greater trunk flexion, while pain avoidance led to slower movement speeds and altered muscle recruitments, but not to greater trunk flexion. Our predictive simulations thus indicate that increased trunk flexion is more likely the result of lack of muscular reserve rather than pain avoidance. These findings align with reported differences in kinematics and muscle activations between moderate and severe knee osteoarthritis patients, emphasizing the impact of severe muscle weakness in those with advanced knee osteoarthritis. The simulations offer valuable insights into the mechanisms behind altered movement strategies, potentially guiding more targeted treatment.","10.3389/fbioe.2024.1346365","medrxiv",1718402772461

Hebbian plasticity depends on temporally coinciding pre- and post-synaptic activity. A tight temporal relationship between motor cortical (MC) activity associated with attempted movement and FES-generated visuo-proprioceptive feedback is hypothesized to enhance motor recovery. Using a brain-computer interface (BCI) to classify MC spectral power in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to trigger FES-delivery with detection of movement attempts improved motor outcomes in chronic stroke patients. We hypothesized that heightened neural plasticity earlier post-stroke would further enhance corticomuscular functional connectivity and motor recovery. We compared subcortical non-dominant hemisphere stroke patients in BCI-FES and Random-FES (FES temporally independent of MC movement attempt detection) groups. The primary outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Upper Extremity (FMA-UE). We recorded high-density EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials before and after treatment. The BCI group showed greater: FMA-UE improvement; motor evoked potential amplitude; beta oscillatory power and long-range temporal correlation reduction over contralateral MC; and corticomuscular coherence with contralateral MC. These changes are consistent with enhanced post-stroke motor improvement when movement is synchronized with MC activity reflecting attempted movement.","NA","medrxiv",1718402772461

A multitude of evolutionary pressures, including the minimization of metabolic costs while maximizing communication efficiency, contribute to shaping the structure and dynamics of these networks. However, how communication efficiency is characterized depends on the assumed model of communication dynamics. Traditional models include shortest path signaling, random walker navigation, broadcasting, and diffusive processes. Yet, a general and model-agnostic framework for characterizing optimal neural communication remains to be established. Our study addresses this challenge by assigning communication efficiency through game theory, based on a combination of structural data from human cortical networks with computational models of brain dynamics. We quantified the exact influence exerted by each brain node over every other node using an exhaustive multi-site virtual lesioning scheme, creating optimal influence maps for various models of brain dynamics. These descriptions show how communication patterns unfold in the given brain network if regions maximize their influence over one another. By comparing these influence maps with a large variety of brain communication models, we found that optimal communication most closely resembles a broadcasting model in which regions leverage multiple parallel channels for information dissemination. Moreover, we show that the most influential regions within the cortex are formed by its rich-club. These regions exploit their topological vantage point by broadcasting across numerous pathways, thereby significantly enhancing their effective reach even when the anatomical connections are weak. Our work provides a rigorous and versatile framework for characterizing optimal communication across brain networks and reveals the most influential brain regions and the topological features underlying their optimal communication.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

At the core of this pathway is the cGAS-dependent production of the intra- and extra-cellular messenger 23-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates STING and leads to IRF3-dependent expression of cytokines and interferon. Despite its relevance to monitor viral and bacterial infections, cell death, and genome instability, the lack of specific live reporters has precluded spatio-temporal analyses of cGAS-STING signalling. Here, we generate a fluorescent cGAMP biosensor by engineering the functional interaction of activated STING and IRF3 at the Golgi. We show that cells encoding for the cGAMP biosensor react within 45 minutes, and in a time- and concentration-dependent manner to STING agonists and cGAMP. We demonstrate that the cGAMP biosensor is suitable for single cell characterisation of the dynamics of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 infection, mtDNA release upon apoptosis, and other sources of cytoplasmic dsDNA. Intriguingly, we show that STING signalling is not activated by ruptured micronuclei, suggesting that other cytosolic pattern recognition receptors underlie the interferon response upon chromosomal instability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the biosensor sensitivity is sufficient to report microenvironmental cGAMP, allowing to analyse how STING signalling spreads through neighbouring cells, including upon viral infection. Taken together, we provide a tool to easily monitor the activation cGAS-STING signalling pathway by live cell imaging, plate reader or immunofluorescence analyses; and to capture the spatio-temporal and heterogenous dynamics of the response to cGAMP.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718402772461

Our research seeks to introduce a conceptually novel approach towards synthetic life by leveraging RNA origami, as an alternative to proteins, requiring only a single copying step between genetic information and function. Here, we report the genetic encoding and expression of an RNA origami cytoskeleton-mimic within giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). We design the first RNA origami tiles which fold co-transcriptionally from a DNA template and self-assemble into higher-order 3D RNA origami nanotubes at constant \SI{37}{\celsius} in GUVs, where they reach several micrometers in length. Unlike pre-formed and encapsulated DNA cytoskeletons, these GUVs produce their own molecular hardware in an out-of-equilibrium process fuelled by nucleotide feeding. To establish genotype-phenotype correlations, we investigate how sequence mutations govern the contour and persistence length of the RNA origami nanotubes with experiments and coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations, realizing a phenotypic transition to closed rings. Finally, we achieve RNA origami cortex formation and GUV deformation without chemical functionalization by introducing RNA aptamers into the tile design. Altogether, this work pioneers the expression of RNA origami-based hardware in vesicles as a new approach towards active, evolvable and RNA-based synthetic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Subsets of VTA VGluT2+ neurons are capable of co-transmitting glutamate and GABA (VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons), transmitting glutamate without GABA (VGluT2+VGaT- neurons), or co-transmitting glutamate and dopamine (VGluT2+TH+ neurons), but whether these molecularly distinct subpopulations show behavior-related differences is not wholly understood. We identified that neuronal activity of each VGluT2+ subpopulation is sensitive to reward value but signaled this in different ways. The phasic maximum activity of VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons increased with sucrose concentration, whereas VGluT2+VGaT- neurons increased maximum and sustained activity with sucrose concentration, and VGluT2+TH+ neurons increased sustained but not maximum activity with sucrose concentration. Additionally, VGluT2+ subpopulations signaled consummatory preferences in different ways. VGluT2+VGaT- neurons and VGluT2+TH+ neurons showed a signaling preference for a behaviorally-preferred fat reward over sucrose, but in temporally-distinct ways. In contrast, VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons uniquely signaled a less behaviorally-preferred sucrose reward compared with fat. Further experiments suggested that VGluT2+VGaT+ consummatory reward-related activity was related to sweetness, partially modulated by hunger state, and not dependent on caloric content or behavioral preference. All VGluT2+ subtypes increased neuronal activity following aversive stimuli but VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons uniquely scaled their magnitude and sustained activity with footshock intensity. Optogenetic activation of VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons during low intensity footshock enhanced fear-related behavior without inducing place preference or aversion. We interpret these data such that VTA glutamatergic subpopulations signal different elements of rewarding and aversive experiences and highlight the unique role of VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons in enhancing the salience of behavioral experiences.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Despite its importance, both the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins of this variability remain largely unknown due to the mixed contributions of cis- and trans-acting elements. To address this issue, we focused on the mutational variability of cis-acting elements, that is, promoter regions, in Escherichia coli. Random mutations were introduced into the natural and synthetic promoters to generate mutant promoter libraries. By comparing the variance in promoter activity of these mutant libraries, we found no significant difference in mutational variability in promoter activity between promoter groups, suggesting the absence of a signature of natural selection for mutational robustness. In contrast, the promoters controlling essential genes exhibited a remarkable bias in mutational variability, with mutants displaying higher activities than the wild types being relatively rare compared to those with lower activities. Our evolutionary simulation on a rugged fitness landscape provided a rationale for this vulnerability. These findings suggest that bias in mutational variability in promoters may constrain the evolution of downstream essential genes toward higher expression levels.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

The dataset is accompanied with an advanced registration infrastructure, enabling group-level data fusion, and contains outputs from the main intermediate processing steps. This allows for various levels of data exploration by the imaging and neuroscientific community, starting from the development of robust pipelines for anatomical and temporal corrections to methods for elucidating the development of functional connectivity in utero. By providing a high-quality template for further method development and benchmarking, the release of the dataset will help to advance fetal fMRI to its deserved and timely place at the forefront of the efforts to build a life-long connectome of the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

However, existing applications often lack the ability to probe chemical composition and molecular specificity without the need for contrast agents. Here, we present a SWIR imaging approach that visualizes spontaneous Raman scattering with remarkable chemical contrast deep within tissue across large fields of view. Our results demonstrate that Raman scattering overcomes autofluorescence as the predominant source of endogenous tissue background at illumination wavelengths as short as 892 nm. We highlight the versatility of SWIR Raman imaging through in vivo monitoring of whole-body tissue composition dynamics and non-invasive detection of fatty liver disease in mice, and identification of calcification and lipids in unfixed human atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, our approach facilitates the visualization of nerves embedded in fatty tissue, a major advancement for surgical applications. With a simple wide-field setup orthogonal to fluorescence, SWIR Raman imaging holds promise for rapid adoption by clinicians and biologists. This technique opens new possibilities for contrast agent-free visualization of pathophysiology in whole animals and intraoperative imaging in humans.

Here, we study the role of biomolecular condensates on irreversible RNA clustering. We find that physiologically relevant and disease-associated repeat RNAs spontaneously undergo an age-dependent percolation transition inside multi-component protein-nucleic acid condensates to form nanoscale clusters. Homotypic RNA clusters drive the emergence of multiphasic condensate structures with an RNA-rich solid core surrounded by an RNA-depleted fluid shell. The timescale of the RNA clustering, which drives a liquid-to-solid transition of biomolecular condensates, is determined by the sequence features, stability of RNA secondary structure, and repeat length. Importantly, G3BP1, the core scaffold of stress granules, introduces heterotypic buffering to homotypic RNA-RNA interactions and impedes intra-condensate RNA clustering in an ATP-independent manner. Our work suggests that biomolecular condensates can act as sites for RNA aggregation. It also highlights the functional role of RNA-binding proteins in suppressing aberrant RNA phase transitions.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Ideally, patient data are handled in a fully pseudonymised or anonymised way. However, this can make it difficult for medical researchers to access and analyze large datasets or to exchange data between hospitals. De-identifying medical free text is particularly difficult due to the diverse documentation styles and the unstructured nature of the data. However, recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), driven by the development of large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the ability to extract information from unstructured text. Methods: We hypothesize that LLMs are highly effective tools for extracting patient-related information, which can subsequently be used to de-identify medical reports. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a benchmark study using eight locally deployable LLMs (Llama-3 8B, Llama-3 70B, Llama-2 7B, Llama-2 70B, Llama-2 7B ""Sauerkraut"", Llama-2 70B ""Sauerkraut"", Mistral 7B, and Phi-3-mini) to extract patient-related information from a dataset of 100 real-world clinical letters. We then remove the identified information using our newly developed LLM-Anonymizer pipeline. Results: Our results demonstrate that the LLM-Anonymizer, when used with Llama-3 70B, achieved a success rate of 98.05% in removing text characters carrying personal identifying information. When evaluating the performance in relation to the number of characters manually identified as containing personal information and identifiable characteristics, our system missed only 1.95% of personal identifying information and erroneously redacted only 0.85% of the characters. Conclusion: We provide our full LLM-based Anonymizer pipeline under an open source license with a user-friendly web interface that operates on local hardware and requires no programming skills. This powerful tool has the potential to significantly facilitate medical research by enabling the secure and efficient de-identification of clinical free text data on premise, thereby addressing key challenges in medical data sharing.","NA","medrxiv",1718402772461

To develop a versatile system, we evaluated the surface expression and activities of multiple constructs containing distinct extracellular fluorescein-binding domains. Using an optimized receptor, we devised ways to regulate signaling via fluorescein-based chemical transformations, including an approach based on a bio-orthogonal chemical ligation and a spatially controllable strategy via the photo-patterned uncaging of an o-nitrobenzyl-caged fluorescein conjugate. We further demonstrate that fluorescein-conjugated extracellular matrix (ECM)-binding peptides can regulate SynNotch activity depending on the folding state of collagen-based ECM networks. Treatment with these conjugates enabled cells to distinguish between folded versus denatured collagen proteins and enact dose-dependent gene expression responses depending on the nature of the signaling adaptors presented. To demonstrate the utility of these tools, we applied them to control the myogenic conversion of fibroblasts into myocytes with spatial and temporal precision and in response to denatured collagen-I, a biomarker of multiple pathological states.

To address this, we introduce a sparse vimentin-SunTag labeling strategy to unambiguously visualize individual filament dynamics. This technique confirmed known long-range dynein and kinesin transport of peripheral VIFs and uncovered extensive bidirectional VIF motion within the perinuclear vimentin network, a region we had thought too densely bundled to permit such motility. To examine the nanoscale organization of perinuclear vimentin, we acquired high-resolution electron microscopy volumes of a vitreously frozen cell and reconstructed VIFs and microtubules within a [~]50 {micro}m3 window. Of 583 VIFs identified, most were integrated into long, semi-coherent bundles that fluctuated in width and filament packing density. Unexpectedly, VIFs displayed minimal local co-alignment with microtubules, save for sporadic cross-over sites that we predict facilitate cytoskeletal crosstalk. Overall, this work demonstrates single VIF dynamics and organization in the cellular milieu for the first time

Carefully controlled experiments have suggested that populations of neurons in cortical auditory regions track temporal modulations within rhythmic acoustic signals, physiologically supporting perception of both music and speech. However, whether cortical tracking of music and speech extends to less controlled (i.e., naturalistic) signals remains contentious. Here, we investigated whether cortical tracking can be observed under more natural perceptual scenarios, and how stimulus type, frequency band or anatomical localization modulates this effect. We analyzed intracranial recordings from 30 subjects while they passively watched a movie where visual scenes were accompanied by either music or speech stimuli. Cross-correlation between brain and acoustic signals, along with density-based clustering analyses and linear mixed effect modeling, revealed both anatomically overlapping and functionally distinct mapping of the tracking effect as a function of stimulus type and frequency band. We observed widespread tracking of music and speech signals in the Slow Frequency Band (1-8Hz), with near zero temporal lags and high mixed-selectivity. In contrast, High Frequency Band (70-120Hz) tracking was higher during speech perception, was more densely concentrated in classical language processing areas, and showed a clear frontal-to-temporal gradient in lag values that was not observed during perception of musical stimuli. Our results highlight the recruitment of domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms during perception of naturalistic music and speech signals, as well as a complex interaction between cortical region and frequency band that shapes temporal dynamics during processing of hierarchically organized temporal structures in speech.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

The ACC may achieve this by integrating reward information over time to estimate which objects are worth to explore and which objects should be avoided. Such a higher-order meta-awareness about which objects should be explored predicts that the ACC causally contributes to choices when the reward values of objects are unknown and must be inferred from ongoing exploration. We tested this suggestion in nonhuman primates using a learning task that varied the number of object features that could be relevant, and by controlling the motivational value of choosing objects. During learning the ACC was transiently micro-stimulated when subjects foveated the to-be-chosen stimulus. We found that stimulation selectively impaired learning when feature uncertainty and motivational value of choices were high, which was linked to a deficit in using reward outcomes for feature-specific credit assignment. Application of an adaptive reinforcement learning model confirmed a primary deficit in weighting prediction errors that led to a meta-learning impairment to adaptively increase exploration during learning and to an impaired use of working memory to support learning. These findings provide causal evidence that the reward history traces in ACC are essential for meta-adjusting the exploration-exploitation balance and the strength of working memory of object values during adaptive behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

The research leverages a unique natural experiment created by the policys stringent measures, which led to a significant reduction in virus circulation from 2020 to early 2023. The study highlights two distinct periods: pre-COVID-19 and post-mask mandate. We used pediatric hospitalization records from January 2015 to December 2019 and March 2023 to February 2024 to reveal a notable rebound in respiratory viruses. The age-stratified analysis indicated a shift in virus susceptibility. The odds ratio of having a co-infection was significantly increased in hospitalized children aged <1 to 12 years old during the post-COVID-19 mask mandate. Moreover, the adenovirus infection in younger children was more prominent, while RSV expanded its prevalence to older children aged>6 years old and raised health concerns. The study underscores the potential long-term impacts of interrupted virus exposure on childrens immune development and the need for vigilant monitoring of respiratory virus trends. It calls for further research to elucidate the causal relationships between SARS-CoV-2 exposure, subsequent respiratory virus susceptibility, and the implications for paediatric health in the post-pandemic era.

In particular, intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are subject to phosphorylation as a means to modulate their interactions and functions. Toward understanding the relationship between phosphorylation in IDRs and specific functional outcomes, we must consider how phosphorylation affects the IDR conformational ensemble. Various experimental techniques are suited to interrogate the features of IDR ensembles; molecular simulations can provide complementary insights and even illuminate ensemble features that may be experimentally inaccessible. Therefore, we sought to expand the tools available to study phosphorylated IDRs by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. To this end, we implemented parameters for phosphoserine (pSer) and phosphothreonine (pThr) into the OPLS version of the continuum solvent model, ABSINTH, and assessed their performance in all-atom simulations compared to published findings. We simulated short (< 20 residues) and long (> 80 residues) phospho-IDRs that, collectively, survey both local and global phosphorylation-induced changes to the ensemble. Our simulations of four well-studied phospho-IDRs show near-quantitative agreement with published findings for these systems via metrics including changes to radius of gyration, transient helicity, and persistence length. We also leveraged the inherent advantage of sequence control in molecular simulations to explore the conformational effects of diverse combinations of phospho-sites in two multi-phosphorylated IDRs. Our results support and expand on prior observations that connect phosphorylation to changes in the IDR conformational ensemble. Herein, we describe phosphorylation as a means to alter sequence chemistry, net charge and charge patterning, and intramolecular interactions, which can collectively modulate the local and global IDR ensemble features.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Although theory predicts that antagonistic interactions between species increase rates of molecular evolution, predictions for how mutualism affects evolutionary rates are mixed. Here, we compared rates of molecular evolution between 1) mutualistic and non-mutualistic legumes, 2) an independent set of symbiotic rhizobia and their non-symbiotic close relatives, and 3) symbiotic and non-symbiotic clades within Ensifer, a diverse genus of bacteria with various lifestyles. We assembled transcriptomes de novo for 12 legume species and then calculated dN/dS ratios at orthologous genes in all species to determine if genes in mutualistic plants evolve faster or slower than in their non-mutualistic relatives. We also calculated dN/dS ratios in symbiosis genes known to be important for nodulation with rhizobia. We found that mutualists have higher rates of molecular evolution genome-wide compared to non-mutualist legumes. We next calculated dN/dS ratios in 14 bacteria species across the proteobacteria phylogeny that differ in whether they associate mutualistically with plants, using previously published data. We found that in most pairs, symbiotic rhizobia show higher dN/dS values compared to their non-symbiotic relatives. Finally, within a bacterial genus with many well-characterized mutualist species (Ensifer), we calculated dN/dS ratios in symbiotic and non-symbiotic clades and found that symbiotic lineages have higher rates of molecular evolution genome-wide, but not at genes on the symbiotic plasmid pSymB. Our results suggest that although mutualism between legumes and rhizobia is associated with elevated rates of molecular evolution genome-wide, symbiosis genes may be evolutionarily stagnant.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change with time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a unifying theoretical framework, a general interpretation, and a common set of measures to quantify the dFC matrices properties. Moreover, the dFC field has been lacking ad-hoc algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently. This has prevented the field to show its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real time applications. With this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a unifying approach that allows the study brain signals at different spatio-temporal scales, down to voxel level, that is computationally ultrafast. DySCo unifies in a single theoretical framework the most employed dFC matrices, which share a common mathematical structure. Doing so it allows: 1) A new interpretation of dFC that further justifies its use to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of data interactions in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities. 2) The introduction of the the Recurrence Matrix EVD to compute and store the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of all types of dFC matrices in an efficent manner that is orders of magnitude faster than naive algorithms, and without loss of information. 3) To simply define quantities of interest for the dynamic analyses such as: the amount of connectivity (norm of a matrix) the similarity between matrices, their informational complexity. The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm - the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We demonstrate that all the measures proposed are highly sensitive to changes in brain configurations. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we perform the analysis at the voxel-level, a computationally very demanding task which is easily afforded by the RMEVD algorithm.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Despite their catalytic domains sharing over 90% sequence similarity, they preferentially methylate different flanking nucleotides adjacent to a classical CG motif. To uncover the basis of this selective methylation pattern, we conducted extensive molecular dynamics simulations of DNMT3A/B bound to eight possible CGX[C/G/T/A] motifs. Our comparative analysis of dynamic enzyme-DNA interactions revealed that single nucleotide substitutions in CGX motifs significantly alter DNMT3A-DNA hydrogen bonding profiles, resulting in a more specific readout for DNMT3A compared to DNMT3B. We found that +2 CGX nucleotide selectivity is driven by Arg/Lys-Guanine base-specific hydrogen bonds formed between DNMT3A/B and DNA. More specifically, Arg836 in DNMT3A reads the guanine complementary to C+2 in its cognate CGC motif, while Lys777 in DNMT3B recognizes two consecutive guanines in its cognate CGG. In DNMT3B, the impact of Arg-to-Lys mutation is mitigated through the cooperative nucleotide recognition directed by Asn779. All in all, our study provides fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA sequence selectivity in de novo DNA methylation at the atomistic scale, which will have direct implications in understanding other DNA sequence recognition mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

These regions, formed by highly similar tandem arrays, pose significant challenges for experimental and informatic study, impeding sequence-level descriptions essential for understanding genetic variation. Here, we report the assembly and variation analysis of such repetitive regions in Drosophila melanogaster, offering significant improvements to the existing community reference assembly. Our work successfully recovers previously elusive segments, including complete reconstructions of the histone locus and the pericentric heterochromatin of the X chromosome, spanning the Stellate locus to the distal flank of the rDNA cluster. To infer structural changes in these regions where alignments are often not practicable, we introduce landmark anchors based on unique variants that are putatively orthologous. These regions display considerable structural variation between different D. melanogaster strains, exhibiting differences in copy number and organization of homologous repeat units between haplotypes. In the histone cluster, although we observe minimal genetic exchange indicative of crossing over, the variation patterns suggest mechanisms such as unequal sister chromatid exchange. We also examine the prevalence and scale of concerted evolution in the histone and Stellate clusters and discuss the mechanisms underlying these observed patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

To emulate the complex chemical systems in biological cells, it is necessary to incorporate an increasing number of cellular functions into single compartments. Artificial organelles that spatially segregate reactions inside artificial cells will be beneficial in this context by rectifying biochemical pathways. In our study, we developed artificial cells featuring all-aqueous droplet-in-droplet structures that separate transcription and translation processes, mimicking the nucleus and cytosol in eukaryotic cells. This droplet-in-droplet architecture utilizes intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) to form coacervate droplets for the inner compartments, and aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) for the outer compartments, with the outer interfaces stabilized by colloidal emulsifiers. The inner droplet was designed to enrich DNA and RNA polymerase to conduct transcription, which was coupled to translation at the outer droplet, realizing the cascade reaction mediated by mRNA. We also demonstrate that these processes proceed independently within each artificial cell compartment, maintaining the correspondence between genotype and phenotype. The modular configuration of these artificial organelles could be extended to other enzymatic reactions. Coupled with the ease of manufacturing these artificial cells, which only requires simple agitation in an all-aqueous mixture, this approach provides a practical and accessible tool for exploring complex systems of artificial organelles within large ensembles of artificial cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

To examine this, we co-administered psilocybin (25 mg) with the amnestic benzodiazepine midazolam in 8 healthy participants and assayed the subjective quality of, and memory for, the dosing-day experience. We identified a midazolam dose that allowed a conscious psychedelic experience to occur while partially impairing memory for the experience. Furthermore, midazolam dose and memory impairment tended to associate inversely with salience, insight, and well-being induced by psilocybin. These data suggest a role for memory in therapeutically relevant behavioral effects occasioned by psilocybin. Because midazolam blocks memory by blocking cortical neural plasticity, it may also be useful for evaluating the contribution of the pro-neuroplastic properties of psychedelics to their therapeutic activity.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Bile acids (BA) support fat digestion and undergo microbial metabolization in the gut. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is an important modulator of the BA homeostasis. The capacity of inhibiting cancer-related processes when activated, make FXR an appealing therapeutic target. In this work, we assess the role of diet on the microbiota-BA axis and evaluate the role of FXR in disease progression. Results: Here we show that high fat diet (HFD) accelerated tumorigenesis in L2-IL1B mice (BE- and GEAC- mouse model) while increasing BA levels and enriching gut microbiota that convert primary to secondary BA. While upregulated in BE, expression of FXR was downregulated in GEAC in mice and humans. In L2-IL1B mice, FXR knockout enhanced the dysplastic phenotype and increased Lgr5 progenitor cell numbers. Treatment of murine organoids and L2-IL1B mice with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) deacelerated GEAC progression. Conclusion: We provide a novel concept of GEAC carcinogenesis being accelerated via the diet- microbiome-metabolome axis and FXR inhibition on progenitor cells. Further, FXR activation protected with OCA ameliorated the phenotype in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that FXR agonists have potential as differentiation therapy in GEAC prevention.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

However, anatomical and functional gradients exist. It was recently shown that receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells change their shape along the dorso-ventral retinal axis. These variations likely reflect the non-uniform statistics of the visual environment which vary dramatically from ground to sky. Horizontal cells are the first visual interneurons and dictate the synaptic signaling between photoreceptors and bipolar cells by lateral interactions, thereby shaping the receptive fields of down-stream neurons. Thus, we asked whether regional specializations are present at this earliest stage of synaptic circuitry, i.e. at the level of horizontal cells. We analyzed horizontal cell density distributions, morphological properties, localization of gap junction proteins, and the spatial extent of horizontal cell electrical coupling across complete retinas. All of these horizontal cell key features were asymmetrically organized along the dorso-ventral axis. Dorsal horizontal cells were less densely distributed, had larger dendritic trees, and electrical coupling was more extensive than in their ventral counterparts. The steepest change along this gradient occurred at the opsin transition zone of photoreceptors, i.e. the mouse visual horizon. Therefore, our results show that the cellular and synaptic organization of the mouse visual system are adapted to the visual environment at the earliest possible level, and that horizontal cells are well suited to form the cellular substrate for the global gradient previously described for the receptive field structures of retinal ganglion cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

The Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) experienced a drastic range decline strongly driven by hybridization with non-native green iguanas (NNGI, Iguana iguana species complex). With numerous NNGI populations within the Lesser Antilles, it is a matter of time before these arrive on the last I. delicatisisma inhabited islands, whereupon rapid in-situ identification of non-native and hybrid animals is essential. However, only a few scale and coloration characters allow in-situ identification of NNGI, which are compromised by introgression. Here we assessed the differentiating power of an additional 20 scale and length-dependent characteristics between the I. delicatissima population on St. Eustatius and the established NNGI population on St. Maarten, the main source of arriving stowaway iguanas on St. Eustatius. We identified 14 length-dependent characteristics that significantly differ between I. delicatissima and NNGIs, with multi-variate analysis showing clear morphospace separation and high assignment accuracy of predictive models (>91%). Additionally, the number of femorals and supra digital scales significantly differs between these iguanas. Morphospace knowledge of St. Eustatius I. delicatissima now allows rapid identification of any divergent iguanas using easy to obtain measurements and meristics. Given intraspecific variation in I. delicatissima and green iguanas, we recommend that these characteristics are assessed and validated for other populations, including hybrid individuals.

The incomplete understanding of the molecular disease mechanisms results in lacking treatment options, leading to high mortality amongst patients. Here, using an inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific lamin A/C depletion mouse model, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic study, combining both bulk and single nucleus RNA sequencing, and spanning LMNA-DCM disease progression, to identify potential disease drivers. Our refined analysis pipeline identified 496 genes already misregulated early in disease. The expression of these genes was largely driven by disease specific cardiomyocyte sub-populations and involved biological processes mediating cellular response to DNA damage, cytosolic pattern recognition, and innate immunity. Indeed, DNA damage in LMNA-DCM hearts was significantly increased early in disease and correlated with reduced cardiomyocyte lamin A levels. Activation of cytosolic pattern recognition in cardiomyocytes was independent of cGAS, which is rarely expressed in cardiomyocytes, but likely occurred downstream of other pattern recognition sensors such as IFI16. Altered gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts and immune cell infiltration further contributed to tissue-wide changes in gene expression. Our transcriptomic analysis further predicted significant alterations in cell-cell communication between cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and immune cells, mediated through early changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the LMNA-DCM hearts. Taken together, our work suggests a model in which nuclear damage in cardiomyocytes leads to activation of DNA damage responses, cytosolic pattern recognition pathway, and other signaling pathways that activate inflammation, immune cell recruitment, and transcriptional changes in cardiac fibroblasts, which collectively drive LMNA-DCM pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Numerous renal diseases are recognized to be driven by the immune system. Despite this recognition, the development of targeted therapies has been challenging as knowledge of the underlying mechanism and complex interactions remains insufficient. Recent advancements in the field offer promising avenues for exploring the interplay between renal cells and immune cells and their role in the development of renal inflammation and diseases. This study describes the establishment of a human immunocompetent 3D in vitro co-culture model of the proximal tubule in a high-throughput microfluidic platform that can be used to study renal functionality and inflammatory processes. The model incorporated RPTEC in the top compartment and HUVECs in the bottom compartment cultured under flow and in direct contact with a collagen-I ECM gel resulting in the formation of polarized tubular structures. As an immune component, human primary monocytes of different donors were added to the lumen of the endothelium. Renal inflammation was successfully induced using complement activated serum (CAS) as evident by epithelial morphological changes, increased expression of adhesion molecules, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced epithelial viability. Realtime migratory behavior of monocytes showed increased extravasation and migration towards the ECM and Renal compartment upon exposure to CAS with donor-to-donor differences observed. Finally, immune modulatory compounds showed efficacious inhibition of monocyte migration under inflammatory conditions in the microfluidic co-culture model. A successful co-culture model was established and can be applied to study renal functionality in health and disease but also for drug screening due to the compatibility of the platform with automation and relatively high throughput. Overall, the described proximal tubule model has high potential to fill the gap that currently exists to study renal inflammation preclinically.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Here, we establish that TMX5 covalently engages via its active site cysteine residue at position 220 a subset of secretory proteins, mainly single- and multi-pass Golgi-resident polypeptides. TMX5 also interacts non-covalently, and covalently, via non-catalytic cysteine residues, with the PDI family members PDI, ERp57 and ERp44. The association of TMX5 and ERp44 requires formation of a mixed disulfide between the catalytic cysteine residue 29 of ERp44 and the non-catalytic cysteine residues 114 and/or 124 of TMX5 and controls the ER retention of TMX5. Thus, TMX5 belongs to the family of proteins including Eroalpha, Ero1beta, Prx4, ERAP1, SUMF1 that do not display ER retention sequences and rely on ERp44 engagement for proper inter-compartmental distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

However, very few studies have investigated the potential pathogenic role of its most abundant protein, myosin. Hence, here, we aim to define this by focusing on myosin energy-saving state known as super-relaxed state (SRX). We performed an array of (loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments, LC-MS/MS proteomics, X-ray diffraction) assays on vastus lateralis biopsies from diabetic patients and matched controls. Strikingly, our results highlight that the amount of muscle myosin molecules in SRX is higher and the related ATP demand lower in type II diabetes patients than in controls. These physiological changes are parallel with greater glycation levels on myosin heavy chains, and with remodelled sarcomeric proteins in the same type II diabetes patients. None of these (mal)adaptations were noticed in patients with type I diabetes. Altogether, our findings emphasize a complex molecular dysregulation of myosin SRX and ATP consumption in type II diabetes. Ultimately, pharmacological targeting of SRX could benefit whole-body metabolic health through the enhancement of energy expenditure.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

To develop immunity, bacteria integrate spacers - fragments of the invading nucleic acids - into their CRISPR array to serve as the basis for sequence-targeted DNA cleavage. However, upon infection, phages quickly take over the metabolism of the bacteria, leaving little time for the bacteria to acquire new spacers, transcribe them and use them to cut the invading DNA. To develop CRISPR immunity, bacteria must be safely exposed to phage DNA. Phage infection releases eDNA which could be involved in the development of CRISPR immunity. Using S. thermophilus and phages 2972 and 858 as a model for CRISPR immunity, we show that eDNA is crucial to the development of optimal CRISPR immunity, as generation of phage-immune bacterial colonies decrease with eDNA digestion. Furthermore, it is phage eDNA specifically that impacts CRISPR immunity since its addition increases the generation of phage-immune colonies. We also show that the effect of eDNA is phage-specific, sequence specific and can even be traced to a region of the genome covering the early-expressed genes which differ between phages 2972 and 858. However, we also show that eDNA is not used as a source of genetic information for spacer acquisition. This suggests that the effect of eDNA involves a new mechanism of phage resistance. Moreover, the effect of eDNA is highly dependent on environmental conditions as variation in media suppliers are sufficient to interfere with this effect. These results link environmental conditions, specifically eDNA, to the CRISPR-Cas system, providing a better understanding of the context of the emergence of CRISPR immunity and could inform our understanding of the mechanisms through which bacteria detect the presence of phages before infection.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Actin function is regulated in part by posttranslational modifications. One such modification in non-muscle cells is arginylation, in which an arginine residue is added to the N-terminus of {beta}-actin. What is the structure of arginylated {beta}-actin (R-{beta}-actin), are its interactions with other proteins altered and what phenotypes result when R-{beta}-actin is the sole actin isoform present in the cell? Here we report the 4.2 [A] structure of ADP-bound human R-{beta}-actin filaments, the overall structure of which is nearly identical to the filaments made of non-arginylated actin. In vitro functional assays using isoform-pure actins with defined post-translational modifications reveal that the interaction between myosin-II and actin is altered upon actin arginylation, due to frequent detachment of myosin-II from R-actin filaments. In vivo, we find that replacement of the only actin gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe with a synthetic gene encoding R-Sp-actin reduces Arp2/3-based actin patches while thickening the formin-induced actin. Furthermore, consistent with altered interactions between myosin-II and R-actin filaments, the assembly and constriction of cytokinetic actomyosin ring are perturbed in the R-Sp-actin cells. Thus, despite the overall structural similarity of arginylated and non-arginylated actin filaments, actin arginylation affects actin filament assortment into distinct subcellular structures and its interaction with myosin II.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Clinical grading of disease strongly predicts recurrence and survival after surgery and is determined by morphological assessment of histological growth patterns in resected tumours. The molecular basis of growth pattern is poorly understood at present, as are the mechanisms linking growth pattern to recurrence and death. Interestingly, the two archetypal lethal morphologies, solid and micropapillary patterns, are characterised by their biphasic appearance. Both have an epithelial fraction which is in direct stromal contact, and a fraction which is not. This morphological variance seems likely to represent plasticity, and to be causally linked to mechanisms of virulence. To investigate the gene expression changes related to growth pattern both intra- and inter-tumoral, we applied spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring GeoMx DSP) to tissue microarray specimens of primary resected human lung adenocarcinoma. Using a variety of region-of-interest (ROI) selection strategies, we sampled 160 pure epithelial ROIs across 7 distinct morphological features of LUAD from 51 patients. Analyses of gene expression reveal fundamental trajectories connecting growth patterns, and crucial modes of plasticity which underly high-risk morphologies. These modes suggest mechanisms for the origins of growth pattern and mechanisms of virulence. Our work highlights dramatic divergence in gene expression programmes between highly lethal but morphologically diverse modes of tumour growth. Furthermore, it provides an explanation for how microscopically localised hypoxia in the primary tumour helps to establish and maintain survival strategies which ultimately determine morphology-specific mechanisms of tumour metastasis, suggesting new therapeutic vulnerabilities.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

To address this problem, we sequenced the exomes of ten species in genus Danio and used them to infer relationships across the 25 chromosomes of the zebrafish genome. The majority of relationships within Danio were remarkably consistent across all chromosomes. Relationships of chromosome segments, however, depended systematically upon genomic location within zebrafish chromosomes. Regions near chromosome centers identified D. kyathit and/or D. aesculapii as the closest relative of zebrafish, while segments near chromosome ends supported only D. aesculapii as the zebrafish sister species. Genome-wide comparisons of derived character states revealed that danio relationships are inconsistent with a simple bifurcating species history and support an ancient hybrid origin of the D. rerio lineage. We also found evidence of more recent gene flow limited to the high recombination ends of chromosomes and several megabases of chromosome 20 with a history distinct from the rest of the genome. The additional insight gained from incorporating genome structure into a phylogenomic study demonstrates the utility of such an approach for future studies in other taxa. The multiple genomic histories of species in the genus Danio have important implications for comparative studies in these species and for our understanding of the hybrid evolutionary history of zebrafish.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

ESCRT-I deficiency reduced the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in oxidation of fatty acids and amino acids, and increased the expression of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. Although depletion of ESCRT-I components did not impair mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP-linked respiration it caused intracellular accumulation of lipids and increased lactate production, hallmarks of aerobic glycolysis. Mechanistically, the observed transcriptional reprogramming towards glycolysis in the absence of ESCRT-I occurred due to activation of the canonical NF-kappaB and JNK signaling pathways. Moreover, inhibiting lysosomal activity phenocopied the altered expression of metabolic genes and lipid homeostasis observed for ESCRT-I deficiency, indicating that ESCRT-I restricts glycolysis by mediating lysosomal degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

To investigate the role of DNA nicks in this process, we utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase system to introduce targeted nicks adjacent to the (GAA)n repeat tract. We found that DNA nicks 5' of the (GAA)100 run led to a dramatic increase in both the rate and scale of its expansion in dividing cells. Strikingly, they also promoted large-scale expansions of carrier- and large normal-size (GAA)n repeats, recreating, for the first time in a model system, the expansion events that occur in human pedigrees. DNA nicks 3' of the (GAA)100 repeat led to a smaller but significant increase in the expansion rate as well. Our genetic analysis implies that in dividing cells, conversion of nicks into double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication followed by DSB or fork repair leads to repeat expansions. Finally, we showed that 5' strand nicks increase expansion frequency in non-dividing yeast cells, albeit to a lesser extent that in dividing cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

However, the neural circuit mechanisms for stress-induced binge-eating behaviors are largely unreported. The endogenous dynorphin (dyn)/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) opioid neuropeptide system has been well established to be a crucial mediator of the anhedonic component of stress. Here, we aimed to dissect the basis of dynorphinergic control of stress-induced binge-like eating behavior. We first established a mouse behavioral model for stress-induced binge-like eating behaviors. We found that mice exposed to stress increased their food intake of familiar palatable food (high fat, high sugar, HPD) compared to non-stressed mice. Following a brain-wide analysis, we isolated robust cFos-positive cells in the Claustrum (CLA), a subcortical structure with highly abundant KOR expression, following stress-induced binge-eating behavior. We report that KOR signaling in CLA is necessary for this elevated stress-induced binge eating behavior using local pharmacology and local deletion of KOR. In vivo calcium recordings using fiber photometry revealed a disinhibition circuit structure in the CLA during the initiation of HPD feeding bouts. We further established the dynamics of endogenous dynorphinergic control of this behavior using a genetically encoded dynorphin biosensor, Klight. Combined with 1-photon single-cell calcium imaging, we report significant heterogeneity with the CLA population during stress-induced binge eating and such behavior attenuates local dynorphin tone. Furthermore, we isolate the anterior Insular cortex (aIC) as the potential source of endogenous dynorphin afferents in the CLA. By characterizing neural circuits and peptidergic mechanisms within the CLA, we uncover a pathway that implicates endogenous opioid regulation stress-induced binge eating.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Studying the dynamics of these processes has been challenging. Here, we establish an optogenetic system for morphogen production that enables the investigation of developmental patterning in vitro. Using a tunable light-inducible gene expression system, we generate long-range Shh gradients that pattern neural progenitors into spatially distinct progenitor domains mimicking the spatial arrangement of neural progenitors found in vivo during vertebrate neural tube development. With this system, we investigate how biochemical features of Shh and the presence of morphogen-interacting proteins affect the patterning length scale. We measure tissue clearance rates, revealing that Shh has an extracellular half-life of about 1h, and we probe how the level and duration of morphogen exposure govern the acquisition and maintenance of cell fates. The rate of Shh turnover is substantially faster than the downstream gene expression dynamics, indicating that the gradient is continually renewed during patterning. Together the optogenetic approach establishes a simple experimental system for the quantitative interrogation of morphogen patterning. Controlling morphogen dynamics in a reproducible manner provides a framework to dissect the interplay between biochemical cues, the biophysics of gradient formation, and the transcriptional programmes underlying developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein.

We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity.

We then apply our pipeline to assess the diversity and variability of an urban air microbiome, using Barcelona, Spain, as an example; this randomized experiment gives first insights into the presence of highly stable location-specific air microbiomes within the citys boundaries, and showcases the robust microbial assessments that can be achieved through automatable, fast, and portable nanopore sequencing technology.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772461

Our data show that the increase in mitochondrial activity during embryogenesis does not require mitochondrial biogenesis, is not limited by metabolic substrates at early stages, and occurs without an increase in the abundance of respiratory chain complexes or their in vitro activity. Our analyses pinpoint a previously unexplored increase in mitochondrial-ER association during early stages in combination with changes in mitochondrial morphology at later stages as possible contributors to the rise in mitochondrial activity during embryogenesis.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718402772462

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

To simultaneously monitor different types of proteins at the single-molecule level, orthogonal fluorescent labeling methods with different photostable dyes are required. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a major class of drug targets, are prototypical membrane receptors that have been studied using single-molecule imaging techniques. Here we developed a method for labeling cell-surface GPCRs inspired by the HiBiT system, which utilizes the high affinity complementation between LgBiT and HiBiT fragments of the NanoLuc luciferase. We synthesized four fluorescence-labeled HiBiT peptides (F-FiBiTs) with a different color dye (Setau-488, TMR, SaraFluor 650 and SaraFluor 720). We constructed a multicolor total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy system that allows us to track four color dyes simultaneously. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we labeled an N-terminally LgBiT-fused GPCR (Lg-GPCR) with a mixture of the four F-FiBiTs and successfully tracked each dye within a cell at the single molecule level. The F-FiBiT-labeled Lg-GPCRs showed agonist-dependent changes in the diffusion dynamics and accumulation into the clathrin-coated pits as observed with a conventional method using a C-terminally HaloTag-fused GPCR. Taking advantage of luciferase complementation by the F-FiBiT and Lg-GPCRs, the F-FiBiT was also applicable to bioluminescence plate-reader-based assays. By combining existing labeling methods such as HaloTag, SNAP-tag, and fluorescent proteins, the F-FiBiT method will be useful for multicolor single-molecule imaging and will enhance our understanding of GPCR signaling at the single-molecule level.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

Until recently the hippocampus appeared to implement a simple coding scheme for position, in which each neuron is assigned to a single region of space in which it is active1. Recently, new experiments revealed that the tuning of hippocampal neurons to space is much less stereotyped than previously thought: in large environments, place cells are active in multiple locations and their fields vary in shape and size across locations, with distributions that differ substantially in different experiments2-7. It is unknown whether these seemingly diverse observations can be explained in a unified manner, and whether the heterogeneous statistics can reveal the mechanisms that determine the tuning of neural activity to position. Here we show that a surprisingly simple mathematical model, in which firing fields are generated by thresholding a realization of a random Gaussian process, explains the statistical properties of neural activity in quantitative detail, in bats and rodents, and in one-, two-, and three-dimensional environments of varying sizes. The model captures the statistics of field arrangements, and further yields quantitative predictions on the statistics of field shapes and topologies, which we verify. Thus, the seemingly diverse statistics arise from mathematical principles that are common to different species and behavioral conditions. The underlying Gaussian statistics are compatible with a picture in which the synaptic connections between place cells and their inputs are random and highly unstructured.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

To uncover these rules, it is first necessary to find the binding sites within a regulatory region with high precision, and then to systematically modulate this binding site arrangement while simultaneously measuring the effect of this modulation on output gene expression. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), where the gene expression stemming from 10,000s of in vitro-generated regulatory sequences is measured, have made this feat possible in high-throughput in single cells in culture. However, because of lack of technologies to incorporate DNA libraries, MPRAs are limited in whole organisms. To enable MPRAs in multicellular organisms, we generated tools to create a high degree of mutagenesis in specific genomic loci in vivo using base editing. Targeting GFP integrated in genome of Drosophila cell culture and whole animals as a case study, we show that the base editor AIDevoCDA1 stemming from sea lamprey fused to nCas9 is highly mutagenic. Surprisingly, longer gRNAs increase mutation efficiency and expand the mutating window, which can allow the introduction of mutations in previously untargetable sequences.

Growing evidence supports a likely causal association between cardiovascular diseases and the presence of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a cellular transdifferentiation process in which endothelial cells (ECs) partially lose their identity and acquire additional mesenchymal phenotypes. EC reprogramming represents an innovative strategy in regenerative medicine to prevent deleterious effects induced by cardiovascular diseases.

MethodsUsing a partial reprogramming of ECs, via overexpression of Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Klf-4 (OSK) transcription factors, we aimed to bring ECs back to a youthful phenotype in hypertensive mice. Primary ECs were infected with lentiviral vectors (LV) containing the specific EC marker cadherin 5 (Cdh5) and the fluorescent reporter enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) with empty vector (LVCO) or with OSK (LV-OSK). Confocal microscopy and western blotting analysis were used to confirm the OSK overexpression. Cellular migration, senescence, and apoptosis were evaluated. Human aortic ECs (HAoECs) from male and female normotensive and hypertensive patients were analyzed after OSK or control treatments for their endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels, nitric oxide (NO), and genetic profile. Male and female normotensive (BPN/3J) and hypertensive (BPH/2J) mice were treated with an intravenous (i.v.) injection of LVCO or LV-OSK and evaluated 10 days post-infection. The blood pressure, cardiac function, vascular reactivity of small arteries, in vivo EGFP signal and EndMT inhibition were analyzed.

ResultsOSK overexpression induced partial EC reprogramming in vitro, and these cells showed endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-like features with lower migratory capability. OSK treatment of hypertensive BPH/2J mice normalized blood pressure and resistance arteries hypercontractility, via the attenuation of EndMT and elastin breaks. EGFP signal was detected in vivo in the prefrontal cortex of both BPN/3J and BPH/2J-treated mice, but OSK induced angiogenesis only in male BPN/3J mice. OSK-treated human ECs from hypertensive patients showed high eNOS activation and NO production, with low ROS formation. Single-cell RNA analysis showed that OSK alleviated EC senescence and EndMT, restoring their phenotypes in human ECs from hypertensive patients.

ConclusionOverall, these data indicate that OSK treatment and EC reprogramming can decrease blood pressure and reverse hypertension-induced vascular damage.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

In this work, we sought to develop Galleria mellonella as a model organism to replicate the dissemination of pathogens in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). By combining this model organism with 3D printed models of a real hospital ICU, we are able to demonstrate that larvae do disseminate the multidrug resistant pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii within this ICU model and that it is possible to use this model to identify infection hotspots. Importantly, this model can also be used for intervention strategy testing as we also show that bacterial dissemination can be significantly mitigated by the introduction of antimicrobial wall surface coatings. This model provides a robust platform for the testing of antimicrobial surface coatings as well as the study of genetic determinants with a role in pathogen dissemination.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

The best studied bacterial protein gradient is the Min system of Escherichia coli. In rod-shaped bacteria the MinCD proteins prevent formation of minicells by inhibiting FtsZ polymerization close to the cell poles. In E. coli these proteins oscillate between cell poles within a minute, resulting in an increased MinCD concentration at the poles. This oscillation is caused by the interaction between MinD and the protein MinE, which form an ATP-driven reaction-diffusion system, whereby the ATPase MinD cycles between a monomeric cytosolic and a dimeric membrane attached states. Bacillus subtilis also has MinCD, but lacks MinE. In this case MinCD form a static gradient that requires the transmembrane protein MinJ, located at cell poles and cell division sites. A recent reaction-diffusion model was successful in recreating the MinD gradient in B. subtilis, assuming that MinD cycles between cytosol and membrane, like in E. coli. Here we show that the monomeric and dimeric states of B. subtilis MinD have comparable membrane affinities, that MinD interacts with MinJ as a dimer, and that MinJ is not required for membrane localization of MinD. Based on these new findings we tested different models, using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and found that a difference in diffusion rate between the monomer and dimer, rather than a difference in membrane affinity, is important for B. subtilis MinCD gradient formation.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

This suggests a critical need to model the interaction between sensory feedback and intrinsic dynamics. Such models would also benefit the design of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode neural activity in real time, where both user learning and proficient control require feedback. Here we investigate the flexible feedback modulation of cortical dynamics and demonstrate its impact on BCI task performance and short-term learning. By training recurrent network models with real-time sensory feedback on a simple 2D reaching task, analogous to BCI cursor control, we show how previously reported M1 activity patterns can be reinterpreted as arising from feedback-driven dynamics. Next, by incorporating adaptive controllers upstream of M1, we make a testable prediction that short-term learning for a new BCI decoder is facilitated by plasticity of inputs to M1, including remapping of sensory feedback, beyond the plasticity of recurrent connections within M1. This input-driven dynamical structure also determines the speed of adaptation and learning outcomes, and explains a continuous form of learning variability. Thus, our work highlights the need to model input-dependent latent dynamics for motor control and clarifies how constraints on learning arise from both the statistical characteristics and the underlying dynamical structure of neural activity.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

Under elevated temperatures, plant immunity is downregulated, putting them at risk of foliar pathogen attack. Manipulating plant defense hormones is one way to mitigate this detrimental effect. However, it is unclear how plant immunity interacts with plant microbiome assembly and how temperature will thus affect overall plant health and stability. We used chemical mutagenesis to identify a phenotypically healthy genotype of A. thaliana, ""CLLF"", that compared to the wild type naturally recruits an altered leaf bacteriome, including unusually high bacteria loads. Simultaneously, CLLF hyperaccumulates salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonates, has constitutively upregulated systemic and innate defenses, and has increased resistance to necrotrophic fungal and hemi-biotrophic bacterial pathogens, indicating that pathogen immunity and non-pathogen recruitment function in parallel. Growth of specific non-pathogenic leaf bacteria on SA as a carbon source suggests the same hormones may even link the two processes. CLLF also showed high tolerance to heat stress in comparison to the wild type, but SA-associated defense processes are not downregulated under heat. Synthetic community (SynCom) experiments showed that when the taxonomic diversity of bacteria available to CLLF is artificially reduced, resilience to heat stress is compromised, leading to dysbiosis, but this does not occur with the full SynCom or in the wild type with any SynCom. Thus, the downregulation of defenses in response to heat may contribute to avoidance of dysbiosis caused by some leaf bacteria, but full bacteriome taxonomic diversity can restore balance.

Significance StatementPlants are living ecosystems colonized by diverse microorganisms who strongly shape host health. Understanding how balance arises in host-associated microbiomes is a key step to understanding how to preserve, manage and possibly optimize these complex ecosystems, especially in a changing climate. Using a random mutagenesis approach in a natural A. thaliana ecotype, we find that constitutively upregulated defenses are associated with both tolerance to (a)biotic threats and healthy recruitment of leaf bacteria, very likely in a direct manner. Thus, immunity and bacterial recruitment in leaves operate in parallel. Synthetic community experiments show further that this link plays important roles in shaping plant resilience to heat stress, an important consideration in developing plants more stable to climate change.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

However, development of such models has been hampered by the shortage of large expert-annotated datasets. Here, we used information from free-text radiology reports, rather than manual annotations, to develop a deep-learning-based pipeline for comprehensive detection of abdominal CT abnormalities.

MethodsIn this multicenter retrospective study, we developed a deep-learning-based pipeline to detect abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys. Abdominal CT exams and related free-text reports obtained during routine clinical practice collected from three institutions were used for training and internal testing, while data collected from six institutions were used for external testing. A multi-organ segmentation model and an information extraction schema were used to extract specific organ images and disease information, CT images and radiology reports, respectively, which were used to train a multiple-instance learning model for anomaly detection. Its performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score against radiologists ground-truth labels.

FindingsWe trained the model for each organ on images selected from 66,684 exams (39,255 patients) and tested it on 300 (295 patients) and 600 (596 patients) exams for internal and external validation, respectively. In the external test cohort, the overall AUC for detecting organ abnormalities was 0{middle dot}886. Whereas models trained on human-annotated labels performed better with the same number of exams, those trained on larger datasets with labels auto-extracted via the information extraction schema significantly outperformed human-annotated label-derived models.

We demonstrated that tBMT in ALSP is equivalent to or close to Mr BMT, achieving efficient microglia replacement and therefore attenuating the ALSP progress in the mouse model. Next, we applied tBMT to replace CSF1R-deficient microglia in human patients. Our clinical results show that after microglia replacement, the ALSP course is effectively halted. Together, microglia replacement corrects the pathogenic gene and thus halts the disease progress in the mouse model and human patients. This study strongly demonstrates clinical potentials of microglia replacement in neurological disease treatments.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

The integrated stress response (ISR) - comprising the four eIF2 kinases PERK, GCN2, PKR, and HRI - is a prominent stress-responsive signaling pathway that regulates mitochondrial morphology and function in response to diverse types of pathologic insult. This suggests that pharmacologic, stress-independent activation of the ISR represents a potential strategy to mitigate pathologic mitochondrial fragmentation associated with human disease. Here, we show that pharmacologic, stress-independent activation of the ISR kinases HRI or GCN2 promotes adaptive mitochondrial elongation and prevents mitochondrial fragmentation induced by the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Further, we show that stress-independent activation of these ISR kinases reduces mitochondrial fragmentation and restores basal mitochondrial morphology in patient fibroblasts expressing the pathogenic D414V variant of the pro-fusion mitochondrial GTPase MFN2 associated with neurological dysfunctions including ataxia, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. These results identify pharmacologic, stress-independent activation of ISR kinases as a potential strategy to prevent pathologic mitochondrial fragmentation induced by disease-relevant chemical and genetic insults, further motivating the pursuit of highly selective ISR kinase-activating compounds as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in diverse human diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

LRRK2 phosphorylates Rab GTPases within the Switch II domain whilst PINK1 directly phosphorylates Parkin and ubiquitin and indirectly induces phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPases. Herein we have crossed LRRK2 [R1441C] mutant knock-in mice with PINK1 knock-out (KO) mice and report that loss of PINK1 does not impact endogenous mutant LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation or vice versa. In addition, we observe that a pool of the Rab-specific, PPM1H phosphatase, is transcriptionally up-regulated and recruited to damaged mitochondria, independent of PINK1 or LRRK2 activity. Parallel signalling of LRRK2 and PINK1 pathways is supported by assessment of motor behavioural studies that show no evidence of genetic interaction in crossed mouse lines. Previously we showed loss of cilia in LRRK2 [R1441C] mice and herein we show that PINK1 KO mice exhibit a ciliogenesis defect in striatal cholinergic interneurons and astrocytes that interferes with Hedgehog induction of glial derived-neurotrophic factor (GDNF) transcription. This is not exacerbated in double mutant LRRK2 and PINK1 mice. Overall, our analysis indicates that LRRK2 activation or loss of PINK1 function along parallel pathways to impair ciliogenesis, suggesting a convergent mechanism towards PD. Our data suggests that reversal of defects downstream of ciliogenesis offers a common therapeutic strategy for LRRK2 or PINK1 PD patients whereas LRRK2 inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials are unlikely to benefit PINK1 PD patients.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

These difficulties are compounded for small RNAs as cryo-EM is inherently more difficult for lower molecular weight macromolecules. Here we present a strategy for fusing small RNAs to a group II intron that yields high resolution structures of the appended RNA, which we demonstrate with the 86-nucleotide thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch, and visualizing the riboswitch ligand binding pocket at 2.5 [A] resolution. We also determined the structure of the ligand-free apo state and observe that the aptamer domain of the riboswitch undergoes a large-scale conformational change upon ligand binding, illustrating how small molecule binding to an RNA can induce large effects on gene expression. This study both sets a new standard for cryo-EM riboswitch visualization and offers a versatile strategy applicable to a broad range of small to moderate-sized RNAs, which were previously intractable for high-resolution cryo-EM studies.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

Our findings generally support the use of linear time-series analysis techniques for rs-fMRI case-control analyses, while also identifying new ways to quantify informative dynamical fMRI structures. While simple statistical representations of fMRI dynamics performed surprisingly well (e.g., properties within a single brain region), combining intra-regional properties with inter-regional coupling generally improved performance, underscoring the distributed, multifaceted changes to fMRI dynamics in neuropsychiatric disorders.

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions.

Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection.

Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3).

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1718402772462

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.
