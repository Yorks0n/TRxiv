With the increasing accuracy and accessibility of de novo protein design, faster and cheaper experimental screening methods would democratize and accelerate the identification of high-affinity binders. Here we present Cell-Free Two-Hybrid (CF2H), a rapid and sensitive method for detecting high-affinity protein-protein interactions (PPI) that does not require cloning, protein purification nor high-end laboratory equipment. CF2H uses a dimerization-activated DNA binding domain (DBD) fused to prey and bait proteins to trigger transcription upon protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate that CF2H enables the detection of interactions between various types of target and binder proteins such as single-domain antibodies, DARPins and de novo designed binders. We benchmark CF2H as a screening platform by validating previously reported binders for Mdm2 and discover high-affinity binders targeting the checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 in less than 24 hours. Finally, we show that CF2H can be used to characterize small-molecules modulators of PPI and detect protein biomarkers, opening the door for a new class of cell-free biosensors.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Globally, these viruses have caused mass mortalities in captive and wild avian and mammalian populations, including terrestrial and marine mammals. H5N1 has been the dominant subtype, and whilst incursions have overlapped temporally, occurrences have often been spatially distinct. Here, we report the detection of a mortality event in wild birds on the Norfolk coastline in the east of England, where H5N1 HPAIV was detected in five Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus) and a Northern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis). Interestingly, at the same site, and as part of the same mortality event, a total of 17 Great Black-backed Gulls, one Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), one Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) and one Northern Fulmar tested positive for H5N5 HPAIV. Additionally, H5N5 was also detected in 17 co-located Grey Seal carcases (Halichoerus grypus). The H5N1 HPAIV from an infected bird belonged to genotype DI.2, closely related to contemporaneous detections in GB wild birds and poultry. In contrast, all H5N5 HPAIVs from birds and seals were genotype I with a 22-amino acid stalk deletion in NA and the 627K polymorphism in PB2. This represents the first recorded instance in GB of two subtypes being detected within the same avian population at the same location. It is also the first mass detection of HPAIV H5N5 in mammals within GB. Potential infection mechanisms are discussed.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

The persistent infections thought to give rise to these variants, however, have been difficult to identify at scale. This study sought to detect and characterize persistent infection cases in California using routine epidemiologic and genomic surveillance data. We identified 69 persistent infection cases with collection dates between January 2021 and July 2023 ranging from 21 to 400 days in duration, with an average of 44 days. Significant differences were identified in age distribution, sex, hospitalizations, and deaths between persistent infection cases and all sequenced California SARS-CoV-2 cases. Underlying health conditions were identified for the majority of cases with available medical records. The mutations found in these cases were suggestive of positive selection in the Spike receptor binding domain and convergent evolution toward immune evasion and residues observed in previous persistent infections. We describe a 400-day B.1.429 infection that demonstrates substantial intra-host evolution, and a BA.5.11 persistent infection revealing apparent competition between two intra-host viral subpopulations. By establishing a framework for detecting persistent infections, this study lays the groundwork for other public health organizations to monitor and investigate highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

When we analysed the genome sequences of two clinical E. faecium strains isolated in Birmingham, UK, we found two pRUM-like plasmids, pHHEf1 and pHHEf2. They were approximately 25 kb in size and shared the same 10 kb backbone, but contained starkly different accessory regions that were bounded by and interspersed with the IS26 family insertion sequence IS1216. pHHEf1 contained a complete set of vancomycin resistance genes, while pHHEf2 contained aminoglycoside and erythromycin resistance genes along with an integrated small plasmid, pCOLA. It appeared that IS1216 had driven the diversification of these accessory regions. We sought to characterise the role of IS1216 in the broader evolution of pRUM-like plasmids by performing comparative analyses on 152 complete plasmid sequences from five continents. Extensive IS1216-mediated variation included backbone deletions, acquisition and loss of 10 different antibiotic resistance genes, and the formation of cointegrates with plasmids of at least 10 different replicon types. Cointegration events have introduced accessory segments with diverse functions, including horizontal transfer determinants and genes for bacteriocin T8. The derivations of these acquired segments highlight the impact of IS1216 in driving gene exchange between Enterococcus and Staphylococcus species. We traced the emergence of the pRUM-like lineage to a putative ancestor found in a vancomycin-sensitive ST17 E. faecium isolated in 1997. The ancestral plasmid, pCANE, includes the entire pRUM backbone with an additional 44.9 kb in place of the pRUM accessory region. The 44.9 kb segment includes putative conjugation determinants, suggesting that the emergence of the pRUM-like lineage coincided with a loss of transfer functions. We propose an IS1216 driven model for the evolution of pRUM-like plasmids, which appear to have arisen in E. faecium ST17 and contributed to the international success of CC17 as an opportunistic pathogen.

Impact StatementExperimental work has shown that the insertion sequence IS1216, found in Enterococcus, shares the cointegrate formation properties of the well-characterised IS26 of Gram-negative bacteria, which is a major contributor to the movement and accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes in important human pathogens. It seems likely that IS1216 plays a similar role in the emergence and spread of multidrug resistance in Enterococcus. However, the actions of IS1216 in the genus have not been the subject of focused comparative studies. Here, we provide genomic evidence for the crucial role of IS1216 in the evolution of the pRUM-like multidrug resistance plasmid lineage that has been found in E. faecium isolated globally. We have traced the evolution of the pRUM-like lineage to a cryptic ancestral plasmid found in a vancomycin-sensitive human clinical strain isolated in the 1990s.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Preexisting population immunity is a key determinant for risk assessment and pandemic potential for any virus. Antibody responses against the bovine A/H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins were measured among a population of influenza-vaccinated or influenza-infected individuals. Modest titers of bovine A/H5N1 HA-binding antibodies and low to undetectable neutralizing antibody responses were detected in a cohort of 73 individuals. Conversely, bovine A/H5N1 NA binding and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibody responses were comparable to those against a human A/H1N1 NA at baseline. Seasonal influenza vaccination failed to significantly increase antibody titers against both HA and NA glycoproteins of bovine A/H5N1. Recent infection with human A/H1N1 but not A/H3N2 viruses induced significant increases in bovine A/H5N1 neutralizing antibody, as well as increases in NA-binding and NA-inhibiting antibodies to bovine A/H5N1 NA.

In parallel, we made diphtheria toxin-mediated cell type ablation compatible with human cells, thereby enabling in-depth interrogation of the sequence of events during depletion and reappearance of stem cells. Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid. Thus, stem cell-derived retinoic acid actively suppresses the regenerative state in colonocytes, explaining how surviving cells sense stem cell loss.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Methods The 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and {gamma}{delta}T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and {gamma}{delta}T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice. Results A disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17- inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors. {gamma}{delta}T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and {gamma}{delta}T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated {gamma}{delta}T17 cell states. Conclusions In cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of {gamma}{delta}T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

In principle, tailored biocatalysts able to cleave C-F bonds represent an attractive strategy to combat this (emerging) environmental crisis. However, Nature is largely impartial to C-F bonds, with fluoroacetate dehalogenases (FAcDs) standing out as a notable exception, catalyzing the hydrolysis of single C-F bonds in fluoroacetate at high turnover rates. To expand the substrate scope of FAcDs and harness its catalytic prowess for non-natural organofluorides, we designed and applied a robust growth-based selection strategy for large-scale FAcD engineering. Specifically, we demonstrate that FAcD-catalyzed C-F bond cleavage of (natural and) synthetic organofluorides generates metabolizable carbon sources for bacteria, enabling in vivo enrichment of active FAcD variants. By forcing populations expressing diverse FAcD-libraries to utilize various organofluorides as sole carbon source, we elicited a broad panel of FAcD variants that displayed improved activities and drastically altered substrate profiles. In these efforts, we also identified a previously overlooked inhibition pathway, which largely impedes the conversion of gem-difluoride compounds. Overall, our study presents the first large-scale engineering campaign of FAcDs and introduces an operationally simple selection platform that paves the way toward adapting these enzymes for the sustainable degradation of contaminating organofluorides.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation. We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas. Finally, we make concrete predictions, which differentiate it from other theories, and which can be tested in experiment.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood (2,3). To address this, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Here we characterized the silk gland from the pantry moth Plodia interpunctella using a combination of quantitative and spatial assays. RNA-seq analyses of differential gene expression between the MSG and PSG depict the transcriptomic divergence between these two secretory tissues. In the PSG, high expression of fibroin genes FibL and FibH were detected, whereas MSG samples were dominated by transcripts encoding major sericins -- bioadhesive proteins that form the coating of the silk fiber. Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) mRNA profiling revealed sharp cellular boundaries within the silk gland: PSG cells exclusively expressed fibroins, while MSG comprised two compartments each expressing different combinations of sericins. Our findings corroborate the conserved organization of lepidopteran silk glands into specialized secretory subdivisions, and establish Plodia as a promising comparative model for studying silk diversity.

Such unstructured data are generally viewed as challenging for statistical analysis. Here, we used occupancy models to estimate what proportion of spatial units (both non-natural and forest) a given species occupied annually in the plantation. Models with different covariates were tested for species for which most data were available: 13 birds, 7 mammals, among which the iconic Orangutan Pongo pygmaeus, and 3 reptiles. For each species, the model which best fitted the data was selected. Two shortcomings in our data complicated the analyses. First, occupancy models require detection and non-detection records, but because no fixed species lists were used, there is no unique way to generate non-detections. We generated non-detection records in several ways and ran the models again to evaluate the consequences for occupancy estimates. Second, imbalances in sampling may occur because of a lack of sampling design to select study sites. Most concerning are sites were surveyed only once in 2020-2024. We ran the models without those sites to examine whether results were different. Although the shortcomings mentioned turned out not to distort our results, the occupancy estimates were imprecise for many study species because of low detection rates, and extra efforts are needed to improve that.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

We find that this variant disrupts the activity of a previously unstudied antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located between HOXA7 and HOXA9, which we have named HOTSCRAMBL. The HOTSCRAMBL variant disrupts lncRNA function and reduces human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal. Mechanistically, HOTSCRAMBL enables appropriate expression and splicing of HOXA genes in HSCs, most notably HOXA9, in an SRSF2-dependent manner. Given the critical role of HOXA gene expression in some blood cancers, we also demonstrate that HOTSCRAMBL variation or deletion compromises HOXA-dependent acute myeloid leukemias. Collectively, we show how insights from human genetic variation can uncover critical regulatory processes required for effective developmental gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Membrane fission is thus required to balance lysosome size, number, and composition. PIKfyve is a lipid kinase that converts phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] to phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P2] and promotes lysosome fission since lysosomes coalesce into larger, but fewer organelles in PIKfyve defective cells. Here, we reveal a role for PIKfyve in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dynamics. We show the ER is less reticulated and motile in cells acutely inhibited for PIKfyve. Partly, this arises because lysosomes cluster perinuclearly and are less motile, which appears to arrest ER hitchhiking, a process in which lysosomes pull and form ER tubules via microtubule-based movement. Secondly, the ER morphology is distorted because of hyper-tethering of protrudin, an ER transmembrane protein, to lysosomes via excess PtdIns(3)P and FYVE domain of protrudin. Thus, our findings reveal that PIKfyve activity balances phosphoinositides at ER-lysosome contact sites to govern ER properties and has significant implications to our understanding of disease linked to PIKfyve dysfunction such as neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

These communities are tremendously diverse, making it challenging to assign relevant functions to individual species. Fungal communities may be differentiated at the level of functional guilds; beyond such broad classification we have little delimitation, especially in fungal taxa common in grassland and agricultural soils. To resolve the level of functional similarity in fungal communities and define traits predictive of soil carbon cycling, we characterized fungal isolates abundant in agricultural soils to test the hypotheses that (i) the majority of saprobic soil fungi have the ability to use complex carbon sources, (ii) differences in complex carbon use abilities correlate with fungal enzymatic profiles, following principles of the fungal economics spectrum and (iii) carbon use ability is a predictive trait for fungal community functions. Using specialized growth media, we isolated and characterized 105 isolates and developed a novel FungiResp approach that directly tests fungal activity on complex carbon sources. The largest amount of variance between isolates was explained by differential abilities to use cellulose and starch, with only few phylogenetically distinct fungal clades showing high respiratory activity on these biopolymers. A preference for bacterial necromass was another major distinction among taxa. These key traits correlated with soil fungal community shifts in response to carbon substrate availability. By contrast, enzymatic activity was a poor predictor of fungal carbon use ability, except for correlations in lignin use and laccase activity. The newly established functional trait of carbon use ability offers important insights into diverse fungal communities: Many taxa lack the ability to use complex carbon (on their own), while the most common enzymes analyzed in soil showed little correlation with fungal mineralization potential. The discovery of key functional traits is an important step towards predicting the significance of fungal community shifts for soil carbon cycling.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Parkinsons disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Glial-glial crosstalk is essential for maintaining the regional milieu, and appears to be particularly important in modulating neuroinflammation and many aspects of neurodegeneration. In particular, astrocytes are critical for maintaining dopamine neuronal integrity and survival, and astroglial dysfunction is prominent in Parkinsons disease. As such, astrocytes represent a potentially critical therapeutic target in neurodegeneration. In this study, in vivo optogenetics were used to selectively stimulate astrocytes in the substantia nigra following a striatal 6-OHDA lesion. Remarkably, a single bout of optogenetic stimulation was sufficient to attenuate motor deficits and dopamine neuron loss induced by the neurotoxin. Furthermore, bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq analysis of the substantia nigra revealed extensive changes in both microglia and oligodendrocytes, suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of stimulating astrocytes may be mediated through alterations in glia-glia crosstalk. Altogether, this work demonstrates the importance of understanding glia-glia interactions in neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

To address these enduring issues for one of the most significant Upper Cretaceous terrestrial fossil-bearing units in North America, detailed stratigraphic sections were established on the Murray Ranch and on McGinnis Butte in central Montana and correlated with other published Hell Creek Formation localities via magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and radioisotopic dating of ash beds. Results indicate that the K-Pg boundary is not exposed in the study area, however high-precision U-Pb CA-TIMS zircon ages for two newly discovered ash beds (66.929 {+/-} 0.020 Ma and 66.850 {+/-} 0.026 Ma, respectively) bracketing the  Dueling Dinosaurs locality provide the first absolute ages for the lower portion of the Hell Creek Formation, anywhere.

Ferrets were vaccinated with either a multigenic DNA vaccine encoding SARS-CoV-2 RBD, M, and N (OC2), an N-only DNA vaccine (OC12), a recombinant spike protein with QS-21 adjuvant (S+QS21), or a hepatitis B/D control construct (Hep-B/D), and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Serum was analyzed longitudinally at baseline, post-vaccination, and post-challenge. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced broad metabolic reprogramming, involving TCA cycle, glutathione metabolism, and nucleotide turnover, reflecting inflammation and cellular activation. OC2 vaccination induced strong metabolic shifts in amino acid and mitochondrial pathways despite low pre-challenge anti-S antibodies. Post-challenge, these shifts extended to redox and nucleotide pathways, correlating with robust anti-S and very strong anti-N antibody responses and complete viral clearance in BAL, but with marked airway pathology, consistent with T cell-mediated clearance of infected cells. S+QS21 and OC12 induced distinct, immunogen-specific signatures with partial protection, while Hep-B/D showed minimal systemic engagement. Metabolite-antibody correlations revealed vaccine-specific associations, highlighting lipid and amino acid pathways as potential immunogenicity biomarkers. Overlap and heatmap analyses showed that metabolic trajectories reflect both the magnitude and quality of immune training.

We further standardized AIM data analysis through development of automated flow cytometric gating software, which had superior reproducibility compared to manual analysis. We also characterized antigen-specific Tregs, finding that gating on a combination of CD134, CD137, FOXP3 and HELIOS optimally detects antigen-specific cells. The combined methodology results in a high degree of reproducibility within and between research groups and provides a comprehensive foundation from which standardized AIM assays can be implemented across diverse scientific and clinical settings.

MOTIVATIONReliable detection of antigen-specific T cells is critical to understand immune responses to infection and vaccination, and has translational potential to monitor T cell responses across diverse clinical settings. Activation-induced marker (AIM) assays offer a variety of advantages over methods such as ELISPOT and tetramers, but are limited by methodological heterogeneity between research groups and a lack of standardized protocols. As such, the degree to which AIM assay results are reproducible is unknown. Key variables such as cell source, media, stimulation time, marker selection for CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells; as well as data analysis parameters such as flow cytometric gating strategies and mathematical correction for  background AIM+ frequencies in unstimulated control samples, have not been rigorously studied. To address this, we comprehensively characterized variability in AIM assays, including within and between operators and across multiple research centres, and sought to optimize a standard AIM workflow to enhance reproducibility at both the experimental and analytical levels.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Both properties are derived from a hypervariable protein placed on the infected cell surface called PfEMP1, different versions of which are encoded by members of the multi-copy var gene family. Over the course of an infection, rising and falling waves of parasitemia correspond to transcriptional switching between var genes, with parasites expressing alternative PfEMP1 isoforms replacing those eliminated by antibodies targeting the previously expressed PfEMP1. var gene expression is controlled epigenetically, however what triggers transcriptional switching and determines which genes are activated is largely unknown. Previous work implicated a unique, universally conserved gene called var2csa as a central component in transcriptional switching, however the molecular basis for its role was obscure. Here we describe how noncoding RNAs, an upstream open reading frame and the nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway interact to enable var2csa to function as a transiently activated switching hub that unifies the var gene family into a single coordinated network, thereby perpetuating chronic infections.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

With the advancements of large-scale recordings, efficient and precise automated spike sorting methods have become essential. Existing approaches face challenges with channel quality variability, neuron-specific waveform drifts, and nonlinear changes in spike shapes that depend on neuronal morphology and electrode proximity. We introduce KIASORT (Knowledge-Integrated Automated Spike Sorting), which integrates knowledge from channel-specific classifiers trained on clustered spike waveforms to sort the data. KIASORT evaluates channel quality, automatically excludes noisy recordings, and identifies spike classes using a hybrid dimensionality reduction approach combining linear with nonlinear embeddings. To validate our approach against existing methods, we developed biophysical simulations demonstrating that conventional one-dimensional drift correction methods cannot address heterogeneous neuron-specific drift and nonlinear waveform changes. KIASORT's geometry-free, per-neuron tracking approach overcomes these limitations without assumptions about cluster shape or temporal stability. Specifically, KIASORT identified significantly greater number of high-quality units than Kilosort4 in ground-truth simulations with neuron-specific drift, while maintaining real-time processing capability. Complementing these advances, KIASORT also includes a unified graphical interface for data inspection, sorting, and curation, which is freely available online through link https://github.com/banaiek/KIASORT.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Understanding how heterotypic protein interactions modulate condensate dynamics and transitions to amyloid states remains a major challenge. Here, we combine fluorescence -based ensemble and single-molecule approaches, molecular simulations, and systematic domain deletions to investigate how charge patterning and domain structure influence co-condensation between -synuclein, a disordered neuronal protein linked to Parkinsons disease, and the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP), a structured viral RNA-binding protein. We find that co-condensation is driven by multivalent electrostatic interactions and occurs when the heterotypic affinity exceeds a threshold, resulting in restricted protein dynamics and altered condensate material properties. These changes promote the formation of dense amyloid fibrils, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy and fluorescence assays. Our results elucidate how heterotypic interactions within multiphasic condensates can modulate phase behavior and aggregation, providing insight into broader mechanisms linking condensate dysregulation with neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

In the first iteration of the cycle, we constructed a biosensor that responded to intracellular pyruvate levels within 0.05-10mM range. In the second cycle, we implemented design of experiment (DoE) to systematically explore combinatorial effects of promoters and ribosome binding sites (RBSs). A first set of experiments were designed to identify factors with a significant effect on biosensor performance. The results showed RBS of report gene significantly influenced dynamic range by modulating basal and maximum expression, while RBS of transcription factor affected signal span. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to select a model incorporating two main effects and one interaction effects. The best-performing strain exhibited an 18.5-fold increase in dynamic range and a 37.2-fold reduction in leaky expression.

While the static flexibility of DNA is well-characterised by the bending elasticity or persistence length, no equivalent quantity related to how quickly it responds to external mechanical or thermal forces has to date been characterised. Here, by analysing the single molecule fluctuations of DNA several kilobases long, and by developing new theory for bending dissipation in semiflexible polymers, we show that DNA bending dynamics cannot be explained by friction between DNA and the solvent alone and requires significant contribution of intramolecular DNA friction. This defines a new material constant of DNA - the bending friction constant - which we determined to be {zeta}B = 241{+/-}17g nm3/ms. This magnitude corresponds to bending friction dominating dynamics of short DNA - up to {approx}420nm or 1.24kbp - and a characteristic persistence time of DNA shapes of {approx}1.2ms. Using these values, our theory accurately predicts measured spontaneous looping times without any fitting parameters in stark contrast to the prevailing theory based only on solvent friction with DNA, which underestimates these times by 1,000-fold. Our measurement of DNA bending friction is also insensitive to changes in electrostatic screening suggesting that it is related to the local and complex energy barriers due to Watson-Crick base-pairs, base-stacking and their interaction with water molecules as DNA bends; this localised nature suggests an opportunity for biology to use specific sequence motifs to tailor the friction response of DNA. These findings change our understanding of DNA bending dynamics and highlight the nature of the fundamental trade-off between the speed limit for DNA bending by spontaneous fluctuations, versus the energy cost of manipulating DNA by enzymes, as necessitated by biological function and ultimately, natural selection.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, and plasticity of AMPARs signaling underlies the long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy and strength important for learning and memory.1,2 Recent work has indicated that the enigmatic N-terminal domain (NTD) of AMPARs may be a critical regulator of synaptic targeting and plasticity of AMPARs. However, few synaptic proteins have been identified that regulate AMPAR plasticity through interactions with AMPAR NTDs. Moreover, the scope of AMPAR NTD interactors that are important for synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Here, we present the dynamic, extracellular interactome for AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. Using surface-restricted proximity labeling and BioSITe-based proteomics, we identified 70 proteins that were differentially labeled by APEX2-tagged AMPARs after induction of chemical Long-term potentiation of synapses (cLTP) in cultured neurons. Included in this list, were four members of the IgLON family of GPI-anchored proteins (Ntm, OBCAM/Opcml, Negr1, Lsamp). We show OBCAM and NTM directly interact with the extracellular domains of AMPARs. Moreover, overexpression of NTM significantly attenuates the mobility of surface AMPARs in dendritic spines. These data represent a significant first step at uncovering the unexplored extracellular regulation of AMPARs, with broad implications for synapse function and synaptic plasticity.

Significance StatementOver the past 30 years, significant effort has been focused on understanding the mechanisms that induce long-lasting changes in synapse strength (synaptic plasticity) that drive learning and memory. While many studies have investigated intracellular mechanisms that enable plasticity, especially those acting on AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), significantly less is known regarding extracellular mechanisms that shape changes in synapse function. Here, we identified 70 proteins that differentially associate with the extracellular region of AMPARs during chemically-induced synaptic plasticity. We show that OBCAM and NTM directly interact with the NTD of AMPARs and regulate their mobility on the surface of neurons. These data advance our understanding of extracellular AMPAR regulation, with broad implications for synapse function and synaptic plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Understanding the trajectory of such a genome has largely been done through study of animal-associated bacteria, especially insect endosymbionts. Yet, endofungal bacteria provide another natural experimental model for investigating how microbial genomes change when living inside of a host cell. Mycetohabitans spp. are culturable bacterial endosymbionts of the Mucoromycota fungus Rhizopus microsporus. To investigate the genome dynamics resulting from the endohyphal nature of this emerging model genus, we long-read sequenced and assembled new complete genomes to combine with previous assemblies, creating a global dataset of 28 complete Mycetohabitans genomes. All genomes were between 3.3 and 3.9 Mbp in size and were multipartite, structured into two conserved replicons with some strains having an additional plasmid. Based on evolutionary rate and gene content analysis of the different replicons, we termed the two major ones a chromosome and chromid. The differential presence of a third, mobilome-rich plasmid in some strains and the proliferation of transposable elements provide putative mechanisms for recombination or gene loss. The conservation of intact prophage and putative toxin-antitoxin systems, and extensive enrichment of secondary metabolite clusters in the Mycetohabitans genomes highlight the dynamic nature of this reducing genome. With fungal-bacterial symbioses becoming increasingly apparent phenomena, lessons learned from this symbiosis will inform our understanding of bacterial adaptation to novel hosts, and the process of microbe-microbe coevolution.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

While large-scale co-fluctuations are well-studied, the principles governing their amplitude-dependent transitions--particularly across high, intermediate, and low-amplitude regime--remain unknown. We introduce a co-fluctuation score to quantify how instantaneous functional interactions reorganize with global amplitude dynamics. Using resting-state fMRI data, we identified amplitude-dependent co-fluctuation transitions between functional systems hierarchically aligned with the sensorimotor-association (SA) axis: sensorimotor networks dominated high-amplitude co-fluctuations, associative systems prevailed during intermediate amplitudes, and limbic system preferentially engaged in low-amplitude states. This hierarchy underwent developmental refinement from childhood to adulthood and adaptively reconfigured under external stimuli. Replicated across four independent samples including 7T fMRI, these findings establish the SA axis as infrastructure for amplitude-dependent transitions of co-fluctuation states. Our framework bridges transient coordination and stable functional architecture, demonstrating how brain networks balance external processing (high-amplitude states) with internal cognition/emotion (mid-to-low amplitude states) through amplitude-stratified interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

Despite the availability of numerous calicivirus structures, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of capsid assembly and stability, or about genome packaging. Here we present the atomic structure of the RHDV virion and several related non-infectious virus-like particles, determined using cryo-EM at 2.5-3.3 [A] resolution. The inherent molecular switch, responsible for the conformational flexibility of the capsid protein VP1, is located in its N-terminal arm (NTA). The NTA establishes an extensive network of interactions on the inner capsid surface that stabilizes the hexamers and pentamers. For this structural polymorphism, we show that the NTA must interact with the RNA viral genome, that is, the genomic RNA acts concomitantly with the NTA as a molecular switch. The NTA-RNA interaction leads to specific conformational states that result in two types of VP1 dimers (the basic building blocks) necessary for T=3 capsid assembly. In addition, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to assess whether differences in genomic RNA content influence viral properties such as capsid stiffness in physiological conditions. These analyses highlight the mechanical role of packed RNA genome in RHDV virions, as the virion capsid pentamers are strengthened by interactions of the NTA star-like structure promoted by the viral genome. These results indicate that the interactions between the NTA and the viral genome guide the conformational states of VP1 dimers, directing capsid assembly and modulating its mechanical properties. Through interference with intermediate assemblies, the NTA network promoted by the genome could be an attractive target in future antiviral strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272300

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1752790272301

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1752790272301

Despite these limitations, phytoplasmas, which are parasitic, insect-transmitted plant pathogens maintain a diverse arsenal of secreted effectors that manipulate both plant and insect hosts to promote infection and transmission. These effectors can suppress immunity and reprogram plant development, including witchs broom and leaf-like flowers, through ubiquitin-independent degradation of key transcription factors. However, how phytoplasmas diversify and maintain these effectors in the absence of frequent genetic exchange remains unclear. To address this, we analysed the effectoromes of 239 phytoplasma genomes and identified a diverse set of secreted proteins, which we designated as Phytoplasma-Associated Molecular Effectors (PhAMEs). We found that PhAMEs targeting evolutionarily conserved and structurally constrained surfaces of host proteins are widespread across phytoplasmas. These effectors adopt compact, efficient folds. They often function as molecular scaffolds with dual interaction surfaces capable of linking host proteins or integrating signalling pathways. Such scaffolding PhAMEs have evolved multiple times independently, providing clear evidence of convergent evolution. Despite severe genomic constrains imposed by genome reduction and limited HGT, gene duplications, interface variations, domain fusions, and repeat expansions have helped the shaping effector fold and diversity. While the overall effector repertoire of phytoplasmas appeared largely unique, some PhAME domains share similarities with proteins from other mollicutes and pathogens. Collectively, our findings shed light on how genome-reduced bacteria innovate molecular functions and offer insights into phytoplasma biology, effector evolution, and host-pathogen dynamics. They also lay the groundwork for protein engineering approaches aimed at discovering or designing novel biomolecules with biotechnological potential.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

Pyramidal cells receive more numerous MF inputs along a proximodistal gradient. Some distal cells show surprisingly high convergence via relatively small terminals with fewer vesicles. Pyramidal cells share significantly more MF inputs than networks randomized by degree-preserving swap, and are better approximated by networks randomized by proximity-preserving swap. We identify a feedforward inhibitory circuit from MFs via perisomatic interneurons that selectively target a pyramidal subtype.

Due to a lack of authoritative literature, many also overlook potentially important steps, such as thinning contig over-assembly or identifying transcript consensus across samples, which reduce resource demands during annotation and increase the accuracy of final transcripts.

ResultsWe developed TATAT, a modular, Dockerized software that contains all the tools necessary to generate an annotated coding transcriptome from raw RNA-seq data. The tools remain in a static state and can be coordinated with bash and python scripts provided therein, making TATAT a standardized, reproducible workflow that can easily be shared and installed. We preferentially incorporate tools that are not only accurate, but are fast and require less RAM, and subsequently show TATAT can generate a comprehensive transcriptome for a non-model organism, the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), in [~]8 hours in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment.

Viruses can inhibit nucleotide immune signaling by producing proteins that sequester or cleave the immune signals. Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6. Our study explains how phages commonly evade bacterial immune signaling, and offers a structure-guided analytical approach for discovery of viral immune-manipulating proteins in any database of choice.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

Here, we purify plant CBs using a combination of biochemical isolation and fluorescence-activated particle sorting (FAPS) and define their proteome by mass spectrometry. Our work identifies 15 and 95 proteins uniquely localized and enriched in CBs, respectively, of which 22 are also labelled by CB markers in proximity labelling assays.

In this study, we identify a host-adapted enzymatic module in the root endophyte Serendipita indica that targets acetylated xylan, a major structural component of monocot cell walls. The glycoside hydrolase SiGH11 cleaves the xylan backbone and releases O-acetylated oligosaccharides, which are subsequently deacetylated by the XynE-like esterase SiAXE. These enzymes are co-expressed within a monocot-specific transcriptional program that is enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes and sugar transporters. Their combined activity enhances enzymatic degradation and facilitates downstream hydrolysis by exo-xylanases, which reduces the production of apoplastic reactive oxygen species triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns. Functional analysis shows that overexpression of SiAXE promotes early root colonization, while deletion of the gene compromises fungal proliferation during later stages. These findings define a coordinated and immune-compatible strategy for host cell wall deconstruction that enables fungal adaptation and endophytic colonization of monocot roots.

In BriefSerendipita indica utilizes a transcriptionally coordinated xylanase and esterase module to degrade acetylated xylan in monocot roots. This enzyme cooperation enhances substrate breakdown, suppresses immune responses, and enables endophytic colonization, illustrating how mutualistic fungi adapt saprotrophic enzymes for host-specific intracellular accommodation.

Biophysical and biochemical properties of the ECM are known to affect three-dimensional (3D) cellular behavior, and phenotype that regulate a wide range of pathological conditions. Tunable biomimetic hydrogels are extensively employed to regulate cellular dynamics in defined 3D microenvironments, enabling detailed investigation of cell-matrix interactions. This study aims to establish the relationship between varying hydrogel properties (adhesivity, degradability, porosity, and stiffness, hereby collectively referred to as  matrix compliance) and fibroblast morphology at the cellular and nuclear levels. Poly(ethylene glycol diacrylate)-fibrinogen (PF)-based hydrogels were fabricated and their matrix properties were tuned using two different non-degradable co-monomers of varying molecular weights and concentrations. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in 3D hydrogels for 10 days and their cellular and nuclear morphology was analyzed via confocal imaging. Cells in degradable, soft, porous, and adhesive hydrogels displayed higher degree of spreading, higher cell density, longer protrusions, and elongated and larger nuclei compared to those in less degradable, stiffer, less porous, and less adhesive hydrogels. Matrix compliance conjointly regulated cell density, protrusion length, and protrusion frequency (collectively referred to as  cellular confinement) and nuclear volume (referred to as  nuclear confinement). These results highlight the complex interplay and interdependence of these cellular and nuclear morphological features as regulated by engineered tunable matrices, providing guidance for future studies of 3D cell behavior in novel biomaterials.

Statement of significanceBiomimetic tunable hydrogels are commonly used to support, and control, three-dimensional (3D) cellular behavior to recapitulate various developmental processes and disease states. Specific biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the extracellular matrix (ECM) can be modeled using these hydrogels by controlling the compositions and crosslinking mechanisms. Using this approach, the behavior of cells in 3D hydrogel matrices can be correlated with the matrix properties, thereby providing mechanistic insights into cell-matrix interactions. This study assesses the variations in the morphological features of fibroblasts encapsulated in 3D protein-based hydrogel matrices with varying crosslinking mechanisms. Our results reveal the combinatorial role of matrix adhesivity, degradability, porosity, and stiffness in regulating cellular and nuclear confinement of fibroblasts in 3D microenvironments. Overall, this study elucidates how matrix characteristics influence cellular behavior, serving as a practical guide for researchers developing innovative biomaterial matrices for 3D cell culture applications.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

This method limits measurements of free-swimming organisms without boundary effects or movement restrictions. We present energy consumption measurements of free-swimming jellyfish based on 3D morphological reconstructions of the animal during the process of catabolysis utilizing a non-invasive technique. We used a 6-meter tall, 13,600 liter water tank for swimming experiments without food present in the water column. To study continuous swimming, we implemented an onboard microelectronic swim controller that externally stimulated jellyfish swimming for 50 hours. Computer vision-based feedback control was used to enable continuous swimming against a flow current without encountering the vertical limits of the tank over a distance of 2.55 km or 15,000 body lengths. Using a 3D laser scanning system, we created morphological reconstructions of the jellyfish before, during, and after swimming experiments. Changes in animal volume were converted to energy consumption using the body chemical composition determined with elemental analysis. Free-swimming, electrically stimulated animals were found to consume 2.5 times more energy than similarly stimulated animals in a constrained environment, likely due in part to additional hydrodynamic drag associated with free-swimming. Simplified drag models could not fully account for the increased energy consumption. This highlights the need for hydrodynamic models that more effectively capture these dynamics. These measurements suggest that this technique could be applied more broadly to measuring free-swimming metabolic rates of other gelatinous invertebrates.

These parasites must acquire heme from their hosts, making this process critical for their survival. In the midgut of the insect vector, T. cruzi epimastigotes are exposed to both hemoglobin (Hb) and free heme resulting from its degradation. Despite the importance of this nutrient, how different heme sources influence parasite gene expression remains poorly understood.

Here, we showed that heme restitution either as hemin or Hb to heme-starved parasites induces an early and distinct transcriptional response in T. cruzi epimastigotes. Using RNA sequencing at 4- and 24-hours post-supplementation, we identified gene subsets commonly or uniquely regulated by each heme source, including genes putatively linked to heme acquisition and metabolism. We also presented here the first studies focused on CRAL/TRIO domain-containing protein (TcCRAL/TRIO), a novel heme responsive hemoprotein identified from this study.

Our results provide a more detailed picture of T. cruzi biology and highlights heme acquisition as a promising point of vulnerability. These findings may ultimately contribute to the identification of potential molecular targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies against Chagas disease.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

An important aspect of this endeavor is understanding how an organism adapts to stress-inducing environmental conditions on Mars, such as radiation, shock waves, extreme temperatures, and chaotropic stress due to higher levels of perchlorates. A conserved approach used by organisms across evolutionary scales to adapt and overcome stress conditions is the assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates. In this study, we employ a multidisciplinary approach to understand yeast survivability and adaptation under Mars-like stress conditions, specifically shock waves and perchlorate, by focusing on RNP condensates. Our study reveals that yeast survives 5.6 M intensity shock waves. Exposure to either shock waves or sodium perchlorate induces the formation of P-bodies, a conserved stress-induced condensate. Yeast mutants defective in P-body assembly show defective growth in response to perchlorate stress. Transcriptome analysis, followed by validation, identified several relevant transcripts whose levels are perturbed in response to Mars-like conditions. Finally, identification of several transcripts whose abundance is altered in the P-body assembly mutant upon stress highlights a new connection between response to Martian stress conditions and RNP condensates. This study, a first of its kind, highlights the importance of RNP condensates in understanding the impact of Martian conditions on life in general. This study paves the way for using RNP condensates as a biomarker for assessing the health of life forms during space explorations.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

This study evaluates the impact of RDs on these outcomes and examines the effectiveness of vaccination and antiviral treatments among individuals with and without RDs.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using harmonized electronic health records (EHRs) from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), encompassing 21,704,702 individuals, including 4,825,605 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 4, 2024. RDs were defined using 12,003 conditions curated from GARD and Orphanet, mapped to OMOP concepts, and classified into 18 RD classes based on medical specialty involvement. Primary outcomes included: (1) COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and life-threatening disease), (2) long COVID, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We applied multivariable logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting and reported adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and associated p-values. Models were controlled for demographics, comorbidities, and exposure to vaccination and antiviral treatments.

FindingsOf 21,704,702 individuals, we identify 4,825,605 COVID-19 positive individuals, 6.36% had RDs, with markedly higher rates of rare disease (RD) patients that have life-threatening illness (16% vs. 6.1% without life-threatening illness) and that are hospitalized (13% vs. 6.0% without hospitalization). Otorhinolaryngologic diseases showed the highest risk of life-threatening outcomes (OR 4.51; 95% CI 3.81-5.33), followed by developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.72-1.98) and cardiac conditions (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.51-2.11). Hospitalization risk was highest for otorhinolaryngologic (OR 2.90; 95% CI 2.61-3.23), developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.97-2.16), and hematologic and endocrine diseases (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.75-1.87 and OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.64-1.99, respectively).

In patients with RDs, vaccination alone or antiviral treatment alone was associated with reduced odds of life-threatening COVID-19 disease compared to non-vaccinated individuals (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.66-0.77 and OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.26-0.42, respectively). The combination of both vaccination and antiviral treatment showed the greatest reduction in odds ratio (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.20-0.27). Similar results were observed in patients without RDs. In contrast, vaccination or antiviral therapy alone, compared to no intervention, did not significantly reduce long COVID risk in RD patients, although these interventions alone did result in a lower odds ratio in patients without RD. However, their combination was protective in both groups. Vaccination alone, compared to no vaccination, also reduced the risk of reinfection across RD and non-RD populations.

InterpretationRD patients face elevated risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes. While vaccination and antivirals significantly reduce the acute severity of illness, their impact on long COVID appears limited in this population. Notably, vaccination was protective against COVID-19 reinfection in both RD and non-RD populations. These findings highlight the need for targeted strategies to protect RD patients beyond current interventions, particularly in preventing long-term complications.

As a solution, we introduce Metalorian, a conditional diffusion model that generates de novo heavy metal-binding peptides, guided by MetaLATTE, a multi-label classifier fine-tuned to include underrepresented metal classes. Leveraging both continuous protein embeddings and discrete metal-binding constraints, Metalorian produces peptides with controllable lengths and user-defined binding specificity while preserving essential physicochemical properties. Crucially, our data augmentation strategy enables robust classification and generation even with sparse training data for certain metals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through peptides designed for copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn), which retain key features such as net charge and hydrophobicity, while significantly reducing sequence length and molecular weight compared to known metal-binding proteins. Metalorian-generated peptides exhibit stable conformations and favorable binding energetics, as confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations. To validate binding in vitro, we developed a streamlined SUMO-fusion expression and cleavage system coupled with ELISA-based quantification, confirming robust Cu and Zn binding by multiple Metalorian-generated peptides. Overall, our work establishes a foundational platform for engineering heavy metal-binding peptides tailored to diverse and underrepresented targets, and highlights the potential of well-trained continuous latent spaces for diffusion-based de novo peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

This primary genetic cue is often located on a single locus--referred to as sex chromosomes--and can be limited to females (in a ZZ/ZW system) or males (in an XX/XY system). One trademark of sex chromosomes is a restriction or cessation of recombination surrounding the sex-limited region (to prevent its inheritance in the homogametic sex). This may lead to--through a variety of mechanisms--higher amounts of genetic divergence within this region, i.e. between the X/Z and Y/W chromosomes, especially when compared to their autosomal counterparts. Recent advances in genome sequencing and computation have brought with them the ability to resolve haplotypes within a diploid individual, permitting assembly of previously challenging genomic regions like sex chromosomes. Leveraging these advances, we identified replicable diagnostic characteristics between typical autosomes and sex chromosomes (within a single genome assembly). Under this framework, we can use this information to identify putative sex chromosome linkage groups across divergent vertebrate taxa and simultaneously curate misassembled regions on autosomes. Here, we present this conceptual framework and associated tool for identifying candidate sex chromosome linkage groups from a single, diploid individual dubbed Sex Chromosome Identification by Negating Kmer Densities, or SCINKD.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

However, the impact of disrupting anti-ferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Treg) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4, GCH1, and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or Tregs specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Treg immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These results reveal a unique opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells, but also simultaneously enhance anti-cancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

Human genetic data and functional experimentation have demonstrated that H2AK119ub is required for cortical development, however the molecular mechanism for this remains unknown. Here, we show that mouse embryos expressing catalytically deficient RING1B exhibit intact early neurogenesis but display impaired neuroectodermal fate restriction. Using in vivo, primary, and in vitro models, we demonstrate that reduced H2AK119ub leads to ectopic activation of lineage-inappropriate transcriptional programmes, including mesodermal and endodermal gene expression during neural differentiation. This transcriptional deregulation is not solely attributable to H2AK119ub or H3K27me3 loss but instead reflects sensitisation of PRC1 target genes to inappropriate transcription factor (TF)-mediated activation. Synthetic induction of candidate TFs, including GATA6, SOX7, and SNAI1, phenocopies the fate-skewing effects of PRC1 catalytic dysfunction, confirming their causal role. Our results uncover a buffering role for PRC1-catalysed H2AK119ub in safeguarding neural progenitor identity by preventing inappropriate TF-driven transcription and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variability observed in Polycomb-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

A key component of social behavior is approach, where animals actively move to-ward social partners to maintain group cohesion, establish affiliations, and coordinate actions. While a continuous stream of social information is encoded across sensory modalities, it remains unclear whether a distinct neural process underlies social approach. Here, we developed a novel assay in which a head-fixed, tail-free zebrafish interacts with a freely swimming conspecific, enabling precise quantification of social behavior alongside whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution. We demonstrate that zebrafish approach behavior is jointly shaped by spatial and temporal information from conspecifics rather than by these features acting independently. Social approach behavior is preceded by distinct brain-wide neural activity patterns emerging seconds before movement onset, characterized by increased activity in a small subset of forebrain neurons and decreased activity in midbrain and hindbrain neuronal populations. These activity patterns reliably predict upcoming approach movements from each of these regions separately. Moreover, the extent to which neural activity distinguishes approach from non-approach movements predicts individual differences in social behavior, directly linking neural dynamics to behavioral variability. Together, our findings reveal a neural mechanism underlying social approach behavior, highlighting how a distributed yet functionally coordinated network facilitates social interaction.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

The viral non-structural protein NS3 is a membrane-bound AAA+ ATPase of superfamily 3 (SF3) with multiple proposed roles in the norovirus replication cycle. However, the structure of NS3, and the mechanisms by which it contributes to genome replication and membrane remodeling, have remained unknown. We engineered a soluble, hexameric, and catalytically active form of NS3 and determined its cryo-EM structure in the presence of a nucleotide analogue at 2.9 [A] resolution. The structure adopts a split lock-washer architecture characteristic of AAA+ motors that operate via a hand-over-hand translocation mechanism2. Modeling of the nucleotide-binding site reveals conserved features governing ATP binding and hydrolysis. Using integrative modeling with AlphaFold3, we generated a full-length, membrane-associated model of NS3, in which an N-terminal transmembrane domain, central helical bundle, and AAA+ motor form a continuous conduit. This model supports a role for NS3 as a candidate membrane-spanning RNA translocase that couples ATP hydrolysis to genome movement.

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

In a comprehensive analysis of N. benthamiana agroinfiltration experiments, we model sources of variability that affect transient expression. Our findings emphasize the need to validate normalization methods under the specific conditions of each study, as distinct normalization schemes do not always reduce variation either within or between experiments. Using a dataset of 1,813 plants collected over three years, we develop a comprehensive model of variation in N. benthamiana transient expression, using power analysis to determine the number of individual plants required for a given effect size.

As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

While these have the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discoveries by creating AI-driven virtual cell models, their progress has been greatly limited by the lack of large-scale high-quality perturbation data, which remains constrained due to scalability bottlenecks and assay variability. Here, we introduce ""Fix-Cryopreserve-ScRNAseq"" (FiCS) Perturb-seq, an industrialized platform for scalable Perturb-seq data generation. We demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq exhibits high sensitivity and low batch effects, effectively capturing perturbation-induced transcriptomic changes and recapitulating known biological pathways and protein complexes. In addition, we release X-Atlas: Orion edition (X-Atlas/Orion), the largest publicly available Perturb-seq atlas. This atlas, generated from two genome-wide FiCS Perturb-seq experiments targeting all human protein-coding genes, comprises eight million cells deeply sequenced to over 16,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. Furthermore, we show that single guide RNA (sgRNA) abundance can serve as a proxy for gene knockdown (KD) efficacy. Leveraging the deep sequencing and substantial cell numbers per perturbation, we also show that stratification by sgRNA expression can reveal dose-dependent genetic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq is an efficient and scalable platform for high-throughput Perturb-seq screens. Through the release of X-Atlas/Orion, we highlight the potential of FiCS Perturb-seq to address current scalability and variability challenges in data generation, advance foundation model development that incorporates gene-dosage effects, and accelerate biological discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

Can these divergent perspectives on cortical organization be reconciled within a unifying framework? Using data-driven decomposition of fMRI responses in face-, body-, and scene-selective areas, we identified overlapping activity patterns shared across individuals. Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding. Together, these findings suggest multidimensional tuning as a fundamental organizing principle that integrates feature-selective clusters, category-selective areas, and large-scale tuning maps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of category representations in human visual cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

Protein- and RNA-rich liquid-like condensates form through phase separation on and around chromatin, driving diverse condensate morphologies with varying sphericity and intra-condensate chromatin density3,4. However, a unifying set of physical principles underlying these varied interactions and their implications for chromatin organization remains elusive. Here, we develop and experimentally validate a mesoscopic model that bridges the physics of phase separation and chromatin mechanics. Specifically, by integrating computational modeling with experiments using two canonical condensate proteins, the heterochromatin protein HP1, and the euchromatin protein BRD4, we demonstrate that wetting properties and chromatin stiffness shape condensate morphology, while condensates remodel chromatin mechanics and organization. This two-way interplay is governed by elastocapillarity--the deformation of chromatin by condensate interfacial tension -- and resolves discrepancies in nuclear condensate behavior, with emergent behaviors that deviate from the simplest liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) models5-8. Our findings underscore that nuclear condensates and chromatin cannot be studied in isolation, as they are fundamentally interdependent, impacted by biomolecularly-defined wetting properties, with implications for genome organization, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic control in diverse phenotypes, including cancer2,9,10.

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the hosts response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data of male and female human, marmoset (New World monkey), and mouse gonadal cells spanning key prenatal stages. We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks. Together, our study unveils both ancestral mammalian and recently evolved gene regulatory programs that control human- and primate-specific aspects of gonadal development in both sexes.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and postnatal brain resulted in rich DNA-RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The two modalities concordance and distinction in spatial patterns highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics of both epigenome and transcriptome underlying mammalian embryogenesis, revealing details in sequence, cell type, and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation.

Correspondingly, current theories describe muscle activity as a function of cortical dynamics. Tasks like speech and locomotion, however, require the integration of voluntary commands with ongoing movements orchestrated by largely independent subcortical centers. In such cases, motor cortex must receive inputs representing the state of the environment and the state of subcortical networks, then transform these inputs into commands that modulate the rhythmic motor pattern. Here, we study this transformation in mice performing an obstacle traversal task, which combines a spinal locomotor pattern with voluntary cortical adjustments. Cortical dynamics contain a prominent representation of motor preparation that is linked to obstacle proximity and robust to removal of somatosensory or visual input, and also maintain a representation of the state of the spinal pattern generator. Readout signals resembling commands for obstacle traversal are consistent across trials, but small in amplitude. Using computational modeling, we identify a simple algorithm that generates the appropriate commands through phase-dependent gating. Together, these results reveal a regime in which motor cortex does not fully specify muscle activity, but must sculpt an ongoing, spinally-generated program to flexibly control behavior in a complex and changing environment.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

Participants in an fMRI study viewed either the original film (with repeated musical themes) or a no-music version. By comparing neural activity patterns between these groups, we found that music-evoked reactivation of neural patterns linked to earlier scenes in the default mode network was associated with improved subsequent recall.

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301

As an example, two bat genomes of size 2.2Gbp and 2.5Gbp can be compared in a little over 2 minutes using 8 threads on an Apple M4 Max laptop using 5.7GB of memory and producing 1.05 million alignments totaling 1.63Gbp of aligned sequence that cover about 60% of each genome.

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population- based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1752790272301

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1752790272301
