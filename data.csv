ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1734732506795

Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid. Conclusively, we provide evidence that virus-related and neurodegenerative and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of infected hamsters and contribute to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

As such early identification of emerging bacterial strains capable of rapidly evolving AMR is key. Although antimicrobial tolerance and persistence are precursor phenotypes for AMR, little evidence exists to support their importance in real-world settings. Here we used bacterial genome wide association on national genomic surveillance data of the diarrhoeal pathogen Shigella sonnei (n=3745) to agnostically identify common genetic signatures among lineages convergently evolving toward AMR (n=15). This revealed an association of an AMR trajectory with a multi-and highly variable second copy of metG, borne by a phage-plasmid we called pWPMR2. Further analyses revealed that pWPMR2 was present across clinically relevant enteric pathogens globally, including past and contemporary outbreaks, and that the additional-metG mechanism was present across multiple bacterial phyla. Functional microbiology, experimental evolution, and single-cell physiology studies confirmed that the expression of auxiliary metG, particularly the mutated version on pWPMR2, created a sub population of persister cells predisposed to survival in, and evolving resistance against, third generation cephalosporins. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of auxiliary metG carriage that predisposes bacteria to AMR with real world impacts. Furthermore, our approach is a timely example of using genomic epidemiology to rapidly guide functional microbiology studies in the era of routine genomic surveillance, and also highlights several deficiencies in current AMR surveillance practices.","NA","medrxiv",1734732506795

To date, almost all megaphages have evaded cultivation, with only phage G being in active culture for over 50 years. We examined with multiomics this five decades long cultivated history from nine different laboratories with five different lab variants to the modern era. In this work, we resolved the five complete phage G genomes, the particle proteome, de novo methylome, and used artificial intelligence (AI) to annotate the genome of phage G. Phage G is one of the largest phages with a size of >0.6 um, about half the width of the host cell, and a 499 kbp, non-permuted, linear genome that has, uniquely among known phages, two pairs of ends. Its closest known relative is Moose phage W30-1 which was metagenomically assembled without cultivation from a moose rumen sample. Phage G has >650 protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs), with >65% being hypothetical proteins with no known function, with the rest of the genome geared towards nucleic acid replication (e.g., helicases, polymerases, endonucleases) and are structural in nature (e.g., capsid, tail, portal, terminase). The genome encodes a 35 kbp stretch with 66 ORFs without any known functional homology, a cryptic genomic region that is roughly the size of phage lambda. Phage G has an expansive repertoire of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) acquired from its bacterial host, including a phoH, ftsZ, UvsX/RecA-like, gyrA, gyrB, and DHFR. Furthermore, AMGs discovered in phage G could manipulate host sporulation (sspD, RsfA, spoK) and antiviral escape genes (e.g., anti-CBass nuclease and Anti-Pycsar protein). Phage proteomics found >15% of the protein ORFs were present in either the wild-type or mutant variants of phage G, including genes involved in replication (e.g., UvsX/RecA-like), host sporulation, as well as structural genes (e.g., capsid, tail, portal). The methylome of phage G was localized to the cryptic region with limited functional homology, with supervised machine learning (i.e., HMMs) was unable to resolve this region, but was resolved with protein structural AI. This cryptic region was a hot spot for methylation at 32%, where many of the functions of the ORF are still unknown. Our study represents a doorway into the complexity of the genomic repertoire of the only cultivated megaphage, highlighting five decades of continuous cultivation for the first time.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

The response changes induced by adaptation have been characterized in detail in individual neurons and at the population level after averaging across trials. However, it is not clear how adaptation modifies the aspects of the representations that relate more directly to the ability to perceive stimuli, such as their geometry and the noise structure in individual trials. To address this question, we recorded from a population of neurons in the mouse visual cortex and presented one stimulus (an oriented grating) more frequently than the others. We then analyzed these data in terms of representational geometry and studied the ability of a linear decoder to discriminate between similar visual stimuli based on the single-trial population responses. Surprisingly, the discriminability of stimuli near the adaptor increased, even though the responses of individual neurons to these stimuli decreased. Similar changes were observed in artificial neural networks trained to reconstruct the visual stimulus under metabolic constraints. We conclude that the paradoxical effects of adaptation are consistent with the efficient coding framework, allowing the brain to improve the representation of frequent stimuli while limiting the associated metabolic cost.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

Particular interest lies in studying stone tool use by non-human primates, especially when stone hammers are used to open encased food sources. Percussive tool use is a rare and complex technological behavior which was also employed by our early hominin ancestors. It is widely theorized that environmental factors play a role in explaining the presence and absence of stone tool use across primate populations. Research to date has focused heavily on the quality and availability of tool-extractable foods, and how these compare to alternative food sources. There has been limited investigation into whether access to different types of raw tool material for hammerstones and anvils affects the efficiency of tool users when exploiting encased resources. Here, we quantitatively analyzed how percussive tools of different raw materials vary in their performance and durability. Wild capuchins (Sapajus libidinosus) in Brazil were provided with stones sourced globally from primate and hominin tool use sites. We measured the reliability with which monkeys could crack nuts when using different raw materials, the number of strikes required to open a nut or obtain a food reward, and how these metrics changed over time. We further reported variations in the durability of different raw materials which directly relates to how long a tool remains usable. Our results showed that differences in nut cracking reliability and efficiency were largely driven by the ability of the tool material to stabilize the nut. Furthermore, there was wide variation in tool durability, particularly for anvils. These results highlight the importance of considering raw materials among the ecological factors that can influence the selective benefits or costs of tool use behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

However, whether and to what degree L1 activity directly impacts genome integrity is unclear. Here, we apply whole-genome sequencing to experimental models of L1 expression to comprehensively define the spectrum of genomic changes caused by L1. We provide definitive evidence that L1 expression frequently and directly causes both local and long-range chromosomal rearrangements, small and large segmental copy-number alterations, and subclonal copy-number heterogeneity due to ongoing chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, all these alterations arise from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by L1-encoded ORF2p. The processing of ORF2p-generated DSB ends prior to their ligation can produce diverse rearrangements of the target sequences. Ligation between DSB ends generated at distal loci can generate either stable chromosomes or unstable dicentric, acentric, or ring chromosomes that undergo subsequent evolution through breakage-fusion bridge cycles or DNA fragmentation. Together, these findings suggest L1 is a potent mutagenic force capable of driving genome evolution beyond simple insertions.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

These distortions result in surrogate maps that imperfectly preserve spatial autocorrelation, yielding inflated false positive rates.

Nonlinear Hawkes process models can capture a large range of spiking dynamics, but remain difficult to interpret, due to their discontinuous and stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework based on a piecewise deterministic Markov process representation of the nonlinear Hawkes process (NH-PDMP) followed by a diffusion approximation. We analytically derive stability conditions and dynamical properties of the obtained diffusion processes for single-neuron and network models. We established the accuracy of the diffusion approximation framework by comparing it with exact continuous-time simulations of the original neuronal NH-PDMP models. Our framework offers an analytical and geometric account of the neuronal dynamics repertoire captured by nonlinear Hawkes process models, both for the canonical responses of single-neurons and neuronal-network dynamics, such as winner-take-all and traveling wave phenomena. Applied to human and nonhuman primate recordings of neuronal spiking activity during speech processing and motor tasks, respectively, our approach revealed that task features can be retrieved from the dynamical landscape of the fitted models. The combination of NH-PDMP representations and diffusion approximations thus provides a novel dynamical analysis framework to reveal single-neuron and neuronal-population dynamics directly from models fitted to spiking data.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of Californias state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole. We urge high-quality medical care for prison residents affected by long COVID, and decarceration to reduce the risk of future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1734732506795

Initially discovered in flaviviruses, xrRNAs have since been identified in wide range of RNA viruses, including those that infect plants. High sequence variability among viral xrRNAs raises questions about the shared molecular features that characterize this functional RNA class. Here, we present the first structure of a plant-virus xrRNA in its active exoribonuclease-resistant conformation. The xrRNA forms a 9 base pair pseudoknot that creates a knot-like topology similar to that of flavivirus xrRNAs, despite lacking sequence similarity. Biophysical assays confirm a compact pseudoknot structure in solution, and functional studies validate its relevance both in vitro and during infection. Our study reveals how viral RNAs achieve a common functional outcome through highly divergent sequences and identifies the knot-like topology as a defining feature of xrRNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

By screening 10 million eukaryotic proteins, we identified several domains that define multi-copy gene families and frequently co-occur with TE/viral domains. Among these, a Tc1/Mariner transposase helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain was captured by F-box genes in the Caenorhabditis genus, creating a new class of F-box genes. For specific members of this class, like fbxa-215, we found that the HTH domain is required for diverse processes including germ granule localisation, fertility, and thermotolerance. Furthermore, we provide evidence that HSF-1 mediates the transcriptional integration of fbxa-215 into the heat-shock response by binding to Helitron TEs directly upstream of the fbxa-215 locus. The interactome of HTH-bearing F-box factors suggests roles in post-translational regulation and proteostasis, consistent with established functions of F-box proteins. Based on AlphaFold2 multimer proteome-wide screens, we propose that the HTH domain may diversify the repertoire of protein substrates that F-box factors regulate post-translationally. We further demonstrate that F-box genes repeatedly and independently captured TE domains throughout eukaryotic evolution, and describe an additional instance in zebrafish. In conclusion, we identify recurrent TE domain captures by F-box genes in eukaryotes and provide insights into how these novel proteins are integrated within host gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

Viral sequencing during the pandemic allowed us to track disease spread, quickly identify new variants, and guide the development of vaccines. Tiled amplicon sequencing, in which a panel of primers is used for multiplex amplification of fragments across an entire genome, was the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. The speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of this method led to its implementation in academic and public health laboratories across the world and adaptation to a broad range of viral pathogens. However, similar methods are not available for larger bacterial genomes, for which whole-genome sequencing typically requires in vitro culture. This increases costs, error rates and turnaround times. The need to culture poses particular problems for medically important bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are slow to grow and challenging to culture. As a proof of concept, we developed two novel whole-genome amplicon panels for M. tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Applying our amplicon panels to clinical samples, we show the ability to classify pathogen subgroups and to reliably identify markers of drug resistance without culturing. Development of this work in clinical settings has the potential to dramatically reduce the time of diagnosis of drug resistance for multiple drugs in parallel, enabling earlier intervention for high priority pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1734732506795

Although this process involves coordinated interaction between vessels, neurons and glial cells, its dysregulation in neuroinflammation is not well understood. We used in vivo mesoscopic functional ultrasound imaging to monitor cerebral blood volume changes during neuroinflammation in rats injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the visual cortex, under resting-state or visual stimulation, combined to advanced ex vivo techniques for glial cell reactivity analysis. Cortical neuroinflammation induced large oscillatory hemodynamic traveling waves in the frequency band of vasomotion (~0.1 Hz) in both anesthetized and awake rats. Vasomotor waves traveled through large distances between adjacent penetrating vessels, spanning the entire cortex thickness, and even extending to subcortical areas. Moreover, vasomotion amplitude correlated with microglial morphology changes and was significantly reduced by astrocytic toxins, suggesting that both microglia and astrocytes are involved in the enhancement of vasomotion during neuroinflammation. Notably, functional connectivity was increased under this oscillatory state and functional hyperemia was exacerbated. These findings reveal new spatiotemporal properties and cellular mechanisms of cerebral vasomotion, and suggest that this is a major component of brain hemodynamics in pathological states. Moreover, reactive microglia and astrocytes are participating to increased vasomotion during neuroinflammation. These results call for a reassessment of vasomotion and traveling waves as primary phenomena when imaging brain hemodynamic activity, particularly in conditions associated with neuroinflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

However, effectively controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains a major challenge. Here, we show that Evo, a 7-billion parameter genomic language model, can perform function-guided design that generalizes beyond natural sequences. By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic ""autocomplete"" in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions. We term this process ""semantic mining,"" which, unlike traditional genome mining, can access a sequence landscape unconstrained by discovered evolutionary innovation. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions.

Microbiomes have the capacity to influence their hosts' fitnesses, but the conditions under which such influences contribute to evolution are not clear. This is due in part to a lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for describing the combined effects of host and associated microbes on phenotypic variation. Here we begin to address this gap by extending the foundations of quantitative genetic theory to include host-associated microbes, as well as alleles of hosts, as factors that explain quantitative host trait variation. We introduce a way to partition host-associated microbiomes into componenents relevant for predicting a microbiome-mediated response to selection. We then apply our general framework to a simulation model of microbiome inheritance to illustrate principles for predicting host trait dynamics, and to generalize classical narrow and broad sense heritabilities to account for microbial effects. We demonstrate that microbiome-mediated responses to host selection can arise from various transmission modes, not solely vertical, with the contribution of non-vertical modes depending on host life history. Our work lays a foundation for integrating microbiome-mediated host variation and adaptation into our understanding of natural variation.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

There is now focus on producing different colour StayGold derivatives to facilitate concurrent tagging of multiple targets. The unnatural amino acid 3-aminotyrosine has previously been shown to red-shift super folder GFP upon incorporation into its chromophore via genetic code expansion. Here we apply the same strategy to red-shift StayGold through substitution of Tyrosine-58 with 3-aminotyrosine. The resultant red fluorescent protein, StayRose, shows 530 nm excitation and 588 nm emission peaks, shifting from the 497 nm and 504 nm excitation and emission peaks of StayGold. StayRose also retains the favourable photostability of StayGold and can be similarly monomerised using mutations at the dimer interface.

Limitations in identifying genetic variation from single reference sequences have recently been addressed through improvements in sequencing technologies, allowing the generation of pangenomic references from multiple accurate chromosome-level de novo assemblies. Nevertheless, global pangenomes to date have yet to include genomes from the populations of the Middle Eastern Region. To address this shortcoming, this study provides an Emirati genome reference. Its core is a diploid assembly with a Quality Value (QV) of 60 that includes ten telomere-to-telomere chromosomes. This assembly is incorporated into a pangenome graph constructed of 52 additional high-quality assemblies, half of which are trio-based. This Emirati pangenome reveals a similar level of genomic variation as the one compiled by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, underscoring its utility for the identification of both global and population-centered genomic variation, even in genome regions that have been traditionally challenging to assemble but are covered by the Emirati telomere-to-telomere assembly. As such, the Emirati genome reference significantly contributes to genomic research globally and is an essential resource for genomics-based personalized medicine in the United Arab Emirates and other parts of the Middle East.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species. This resource will facilitate fundamental molecular virology, investigation of virus evolution, and may enable structure-informed design of therapies and vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

How this relates to region-specific early differences in functional connectivity (FC), however, remains unclear.

METHODSWe assessed resting-state FC strength in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) - posteromedial cortex (PMC) - prefrontal network and cognition over two years in cognitively normal older adults from the PREVENT-AD cohort.

RESULTSFC strength within PMC and between posterior hippocampus and inferomedial precuneus decreased in ""normal"" aging (amyloid- and tau-negative adults). Lower FC strength within PMC was associated with poorer longitudinal episodic memory performance. Increasing FC between anterior hippocampus and superior precuneus was related to higher baseline AD pathology. Higher FC strength was differentially associated with memory trajectories depending on APOE4 genotype.

DISCUSSIONFindings suggest differential effects of aging and AD pathology on longitudinal FC. MTL-PMC hypoconnectivity was related to aging and cognitive decline. Furthermore, MTL-PMC hyperconnectivity was related to early AD pathology and cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers.

The whooping crane (Grus americana) experienced severe population declines in the 18th century, culminating into a collapse to 16 individuals in 1941. Legal protections and conservation actions have since increased the population to approximately 840 individuals, yet the impact on genomic diversity remains unclear. We analysed the temporal dynamics of genomic erosion by sequencing a high-quality genome reference, and re-sequencing 16 historical and 37 modern genomes, including wild individuals and four generations of captive-bred individuals. Genomic demographic reconstructions reveal a steady decline, accelerating over the past 300 years with the European settlement of North America. Temporal genomic analyses show that despite demographic recovery, the species has lost 70% of its genetic diversity and has increased their inbreeding. Although the modern population bottleneck reduced the ancestral genetic load, modern populations possess more realized load than masked load, possibly resulting in a chronic loss of fitness. Integrating pedigree and genomic data, we underscore the role of breeding management in reducing recent inbreeding. Yet ongoing heterozygosity loss, load accumulation, and background inbreeding argues against the species downlisting from their current Endangered status on the IUCN Red List and the Endangered Species Act. The presence of private genetic variation in wild and captive populations suggests that wild-captive crosses could enhance genetic diversity and reduce the realized load. Our findings emphasize the role of genomics in informing conservation management and policy.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

Despite their declining presence in advanced CRC, eosinophils suppress metastatic dissemination by counteracting the pro-tumorigenic functions of SPP1+ macrophages - a subset linked to immune exclusion and tumor metastasis. Mechanistically, eosinophils respond to tumor-derived signals and inhibit macrophage differentiation into SPP1+ cells. Eosinophil depletion exacerbates peritoneal tumor spread.

These eco-evolutionary dynamics are largely unexplored, particularly at the molecular level. Here, we hypothesize that such dynamics in the wake of the GOE explain the otherwise paradoxical evolutionary history of metal use in nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. This ancient metalloenzyme exists in three isozymes, with distinct metal cofactors. Recent research demonstrates that the most ancient isozyme, emerging a billion years or more before the GOE, required a molybdenum (Mo)-based cofactor. ""Alternative"" nitrogenases using iron (Fe) or vanadium (V) cofactors evolved after the GOE. This history is puzzling because Mo availability in the environment increased after the GOE, while Fe availability decreased, due to the contrasting environmental redox behaviors of these elements. Why, then, did the alternatives emerge only after the GOE? Using a simple model constrained by known microbial Mo quotas, we demonstrate that a strong selection pressure for use of metals in nitrogenase other than Mo is a likely consequence of competition between nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes and nitrate-reducing microbes, which require Mo for nitrate reduction and assimilation. This competition would have intensified after the GOE due to increasing environmental availability of nitrate, explaining the evolutionary timing of the nitrogenase isozymes. Ecological resource competition therefore emerges as a third driver of metallome evolution in deep-time, alongside the relative environmental availabilities and adaptive advantages of particular metals.

Significance statementThe selection of metals in biochemical evolution is widely attributed to either the relative environmental availability of specific metals or their functional benefits in biological systems. We propose a third pressure, ecological resource competition, which is typically overlooked as a driver of molecular novelty in deep time. Specifically, we hypothesize that competition between Mo-dependent nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes and Mo-dependent nitrate reducers led to the emergence of Mo-free ""alternative"" nitrogenase enzymes during the early Proterozoic. This novel hypothesis explains the paradoxical emergence of alternative nitrogenases after the Great Oxidation Event despite increasing ocean Mo abundances at that time. Competition among microbial species for the same metals likely drove molecular innovations, especially in response to dynamically changing geochemical landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

This affords the opportunity to reveal molecular principles that govern the pre-implantation stages of mammalian development. We leveraged a multipurpose allele for acute protein depletion and efficient immunoprecipitation to dissect the molecular functions of the chromatin repressor EHMT2, a candidate antagonist of the mESC-to-2CLC transition. This allowed us to define categories of EHMT2 target genes characterized by distinct modes of EHMT2 chromatin engagement and repression. Most notably, EHMT2 directly represses large clusters of co-regulated gene loci that comprise a significant fraction of the 2CLC-specific transcriptome by initiating H3K9me2 spreading from distal LINE-1 elements. EHMT2 counteracts the recruitment of the activator DPPA2/4 to promoter-proximal endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) at 2CLC genes. EHMT2 depletion elevates the expression of ZGA-associated transcripts in 2CLCs and synergizes with spliceosome inhibition and retinoic acid signaling in facilitating the mESC-to-2CLC transition. In contrast to ZGA-associated genes, repression of germ layer-associated transcripts by EHMT2 occurs outside of gene clusters in collaboration with ZFP462 and entails binding to non-repeat enhancers. Our observations show that EHMT2 attenuates the bidirectional differentiation potential of mouse pluripotent stem cells and define molecular modes for locus-specific transcriptional repression by this essential histone methyltransferase.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

However, quantifying the flexibility of surface-tethered biomolecules in aqueous environments has been difficult due to a lack of experimental tools. Here we introduce SurFlex microscopy, a method based on fluorescence anisotropy that exploits the relationship between the conformational dynamics of a tethered molecule and the rotational diffusion of an attached fluorophore to extract information about molecular flexibility. By analyzing the polarization state of photons emitted after polarized excitation, we quantify apparent molecular flexibilities that include effects of tethering, self-interactions and buffer conditions. We first demonstrate the capabilities of SurFlex microscopy by measuring the flexibility of bilayer-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of different lengths and nucleotide sequences. We find that sequence significantly impacts ssDNA flexibility, consistent with theoretical estimates, with weak intramolecular interactions in random sequences leading to higher apparent stiffness. Interestingly, we show that a pathological DNA sequence linked to Huntingtons disease exhibits unusual flexibility despite intramolecular interactions. We next extend SurFlex microscopy to live cells by measuring surface glycoprotein flexibility on red blood cells using fluorescent lectins. We show that trypsinization decreases glycan fluctuations, demonstrating that modifications to the cell surface can alter the flexibility of remaining surface molecules. SurFlex microscopy provides a new tool for quantifying molecular flexibility that can be used to study the role of tethered surface molecules in fundamental biological processes.

Significance statementBiomolecules immobilized on one end play crucial roles in diverse cellular processes, from cell-cell signaling through surface receptors to the formation of DNA secondary structures.

Here we present SurFlex microscopy, a technique that uses fluorescence anisotropy to quantify the flexibility of surface-anchored molecules. By analyzing the rotational dynamics of fluorophores attached to the ends of fluctuating biomolecules, SurFlex microscopy can be used to quantify persistence length. We demonstrate its capabilities by measuring sequence-dependent flexibility of DNA and crowding-dependent changes in glycan flexibility on native cell surfaces. This method opens new avenues for understanding how biomolecular flexibility influences key biological processes, such as those at cell surfaces during cell-cell contact formation and subsequent signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

Long-read sequencing (LRS) enhances our ability to detect disease-associated and functionally relevant structural variants (SVs); however, its application in large-scale genomic studies has been limited by challenges in sample preparation and high costs. Here, we leverage a new scalable wet-lab protocol and computational pipeline for whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing and apply it to neurologically normal control samples from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) (European ancestry) and Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) (African or African admixed ancestry) cohorts. Through this work, we present a publicly available long-read resource from 351 human brain samples (median N50: 27 Kbp and at an average depth of ~40x genome coverage). We discover approximately 234,905 SVs and produce locally phased assemblies that cover 95% of all protein-coding genes in GRCh38. Utilizing matched expression datasets for these samples, we apply quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses and identify SVs that impact gene expression in post-mortem frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we determine haplotype-specific methylation signatures at millions of CpGs and, with this data, identify cis-acting SVs. In summary, these results highlight that large-scale LRS can identify complex regulatory mechanisms in the brain that were inaccessible using previous approaches.

Due to its ease of dissemination and high lethality, F. tularensis is classified as a Tier 1 Select Agent with potential for misuse as a bioweapon. The mechanisms by which Francisella replicates intracellularly and interacts with the host during infection are not well understood. Francisella produces spherical outer membrane vesicles (OMV) and novel tubular extensions of its cell surface that are also released extracellularly. These OMV and outer membrane tubes (OMT) contain Francisella virulence factors and are produced in response to amino acid starvation and during infection of macrophages. To investigate how the OMT are formed, we used cryogenic electron tomography to examine the model Francisella species, F. novicida, during in vitro culture and within the macrophage phagosome. OMT formation involved progressive alterations of the bacterial envelope, resulting in extensions of both the inner and outer membranes. A dynamic cytoplasmic structure was present at the base of the OMT that extended into the tubes during elongation, together with cytoplasmic material. OMT produced within the macrophage phagosome were associated with changes to the phagosomal membrane, suggesting a role in phagosomal escape. Consistent with this, using confocal microscopy, we observed colocalization of the Francisella type VI secretion system with the OMT, both within bacteria and in released tubular vesicles. These findings reveal the cellular transformations that occur during membrane tubulation by Francisella and provide insights into the function of membrane-derived structures during host-pathogen interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

In addition, the ability to capture spatial information of kinase activity is crucial to deconvolute complex signaling networks, interrogate multifaceted kinase actions, and assess drug effects or genetic perturbations. Here we developed a proteomic kinase activity sensor platform (ProKAS) for the analysis of kinase signaling using mass spectrometry. ProKAS is based on a tandem array of peptide sensors with amino acid barcodes that allow multiplexed analysis for spatial, kinetic, and screening applications. We engineered a ProKAS module to simultaneously monitor the activities of the DNA damage response kinases ATR, ATM, and CHK1 in response to genotoxic drugs, while also uncovering differences between these signaling responses in the nucleus, cytosol, and replication factories. Furthermore, we developed an in silico approach for the rational design of specific substrate peptides expandable to other kinases. Overall, ProKAS is a novel versatile system for systematically and spatially probing kinase action in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

By contrast, Marchantia-specific immune mechanisms have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of quantitative resistance in M. polymorpha against the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum nymphaeae, a naturally occurring compatible parasite. Through a combination of phenotypic, cytological and transcriptomic approaches, combined with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified key defense-related genes and pathways. Transcriptomic analyses performed on two lines with contrasting suceptibilities to the pathogen revealed a strong overlap in immune responses between M. polymorpha and angiosperms, including the upregulation of PR proteins, transcription factors typically associated with biotic stresses, and enzymes involved in specialized metabolism. Leveraging the biological and genetic variability present in a collection of natural M. polymorpha accessions, highlight the role of horizontally transferred microbial-like terpene synthase (MTPSL) genes, which may contribute to the exceptional terpene diversity in liverworts and play a role in pathogen resistance. GWAS uncovered candidate loci associated with resistance traits, implicating both core immune components and specialized metabolic pathways.

The intracellular domains of many transmembrane proteins are ubiquitylated, which promotes their internalization by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. How might this enhanced internalization impact endocytic uptake of transmembrane proteins that lack ubiquitylation? Recent work demonstrates that diverse transmembrane proteins compete for space within highly crowded endocytic structures, suggesting that enhanced internalization of one group of transmembrane proteins may come at the expense of other groups. Here we show that preferential internalization of poly-ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins results in reduced endocytosis of mono-ubiquitylated and non-ubiquitylated proteins. Using a combination of live-cell imaging and ligand uptake assays, we confirmed that increased ubiquitylation correlates with increased internalization by clathrin-coated vesicles. Further, poly-ubiquitylated receptors significantly outcompeted their mono-ubiquitylated and non-ubiquitylated counterparts for localization to endocytic sites and uptake of extracellular ligands. These findings demonstrate the inherent interdependence of transmembrane protein recycling, suggesting that clathrin-coated vesicles act as selective filters, prioritizing highly ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins for uptake while leaving proteins with little or no ubiquitylation behind. Given that poly-ubiquitylation is thought to signal protein aging and damage, our findings suggest a mechanism for selective internalization of high priority cargo proteins, with simultaneously exclusion and protection of functional proteins that lack poly-ubiquitylation.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

Transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses confirmed the identity of bXENs and revealed that they are resemble hypoblast lineages of early bovine peri-implantation embryos. We showed that bXENs help maintain the stemness of bovine ESCs and prevent them from differentiation. In the presence of a signaling cocktail sustaining bXENs, the growth and progression of epiblasts are also facilitated in the developing pre-implantation embryo. Furthermore, through 3D assembly of bXENs with bovine ESCs and TSCs, we developed an improved bovine blastocyst like structure (bovine blastoid) that resembles blastocyst. The bovine XENs and blastoids established in this study represent accessible in vitro models for understanding hypoblast development and improving reproductive efficiency in livestock species.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

While members of the rhizosphere microbiome can protect against pathogens, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the ability to form a robust biofilm on the root surface is necessary for the exclusion of pathogens; however, it is not known if the same biofilm formation components required in vitro are necessary in vivo. Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS365 is a beneficial strain that is phylogenetically closely related to an opportunistic pathogen P. fluorescens N2C3 and confers robust protection against P. fluorescens N2C3 in the rhizosphere. We used this plant-mutualist-pathogen model to screen collections of P. fluorescens WCS365 increased attachment mutants (iam) and surface attachment defective (sad) transposon insertion mutants that form increased or decreased levels of biofilm on an abiotic surface, respectively. We found that while the P. fluorescens WCS365 mutants had altered biofilm formation in vitro, only a subset of these mutants, including those involved in large adhesion protein (Lap) biosynthesis, flagellin biosynthesis and O-antigen biosynthesis, lost protection against P. fluorescens N2C3. We found that the inability of P. fluorescens WCS365 mutants to grow in planta, and the inability to suppress pathogen growth, both partially contributed to loss of plant protection. We did not find a correlation between the extent of biofilm formed in vitro and pathogen protection in planta indicating that biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces may not fully predict pathogen exclusion in planta. Collectively, our work provides insights into mechanisms of biofilm formation and host colonization that shape the outcomes of host-microbe-pathogen interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

The PlsX acyltransferase initiates phospholipid synthesis by reversibly converting acyl-ACP (ACP, acyl carrier protein) to acyl-PO4, the first phospholipid precursor. PlsX is dispensable in some bacteria, as alternative functions assure acyl-PO4 production. In contrast, PlsX is considered indispensable in Staphylococcus aureus, unless exogenous fatty acids (FA) are provided. Here we report that gain-of-function suppressors of {Delta}plsX enable S. aureus growth without FA addition. The suppressors map to either the FA synthesis (FASII) enzyme FabF, or to a putative acyl-CoA thioesterase/ACP binding protein, designated FadM. The {Delta}plsX suppressors alleviate accumulation of long chain acyl-ACP, and produce shorter chain membrane FAs than the parental strain. Unlike wild type S. aureus, which can adapt to FASII inhibitors, {Delta}plsX suppressors remain fully sensitive, indicating that PlsX reverse activity is not compensated. Importantly, an interdependency between FabF and FadM functions shown here suggests a more general role for FadM in facilitating FA release from FabF-FA-ACP intermediates. In summary, S. aureusfabF and fadM mutations promote enzymatic flexibility that overcomes {Delta}plsX growth arrest by restoring phospholipid synthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration1. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3 region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies2-7, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago8. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.

Gastruloid axial elongation exhibits active cellular contractility, requires planar cell polarity (PCP), adhesion and cell-cell contact remodelling. Smaller gastruloids initiate elongation earlier, correlated with an earlier Brachyury polarisation. Brachyury expression increases tissue fluidity. Axis formation is regulated by the balance of Brachyury multifoci coalescence and the timing of initiation of the elongation programme. Sizes beyond the robust range can modify relative tissue composition. Very small aggregates have increased neural fate bias, accompanied by a loss of paraxial mesoderm mediated by differences in Nodal signalling activity.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

For instance, at ~$1.5-3.3k USD, current NA fluorometers present a greater capital cost than ONT's $1k USD portable MinION third-generation Nanopore sequencing platform.

The DIYNAFLUOR was primarily designed to be compatible with the popular DNA-centric Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) and Broad Range (BR) assay kits. Notably, the DIYNAFLUOR demonstrated an 'in-assay' Limit of Detection with the Qubit HS kit of 0.0028 ng/uL, and an average absolute bias of 0.018 ng/muL across a 0-10 ng/uL working range using a 2-point linear calibration methodology. Device verification was performed by comparative measurements with a Qubit 4 fluorometer in a busy biotechnology laboratory, and build instructions were validated through assembly and qualification of three DIYNAFLUOR devices by researchers outside the primary design team.

To demonstrate its practical application for field-based eDNA analysis in RLSs, the DIYNAFLUOR was used to perform all quality control measurements throughout the preparation of a 16S and 18S metabarcoding library generated from eDNA extracted from Australian lake water, leading to the successful identification of Australian fauna via Nanopore sequencing. Finally, configurations of the DIYNAFLUOR for RNA and Protein quantification are briefly described.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

Unfortunately, clinical responses remain limited due to rapid resistance onset. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional inhibition. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of KRAS degradation in vivo. Here, we developed a preclinical LUAD mouse model and demonstrated that targeted oncogenic KRAS degradation induces rapid tumor regression. Transcriptional, histological, and immunophenotypic analyses revealed a substantial remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Notably, disease relapse observed during long-term degrader treatment stems from proteolysis machinery dysregulation, indicating resistance mechanisms distinct from those reported upon KRAS inhibition. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of KRAS degradation in LUAD, offering insights into cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms driving durable antitumor responses and supporting further clinical exploration.

SIGNIFICANCEGiven the short duration of the clinical responses to KRAS inhibitors, complementary therapies are a dire medical need. Our preclinical findings endorse KRAS degradation as a therapeutic alternative in LUAD, where cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms drive tumor regression and durable therapeutic responses.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

One of the features of embryo models is their multilineage differentiation, which allows the co-development of, and interactions between, tissues. Here, we utilise a human Trunk-like Structure (hTLS) model to explore trunk development. We show that hTLS have morphologically organised somites and a neural tube that form through self-organised, endogenous signalling including anteroposterior FGF, Wnt and Retinoic Acid (RA) gradients that modulate the fate of neuromesodermal progenitors. Comparison to an existing dataset from organogenesis-stage human embryos shows that hTLS cells approximate Carnegie Stage 13-14 (28-35 days post-fertilisation). The absence of a notochord leads to a dorsal identity, but exogenous exposure to smoothened agonist (promoting Sonic Hedgehog signalling) progressively ventralises both somites and neural tube in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identify endogenous signalling from the neural tube to the somites, which leads to medially localised ALDH1A2, and subsequent RA signalling from the somites to the neural tube, which leads to spontaneous neural progenitor patterning and PAX6 expression. Together, our data highlight the value of modularity in embryo models which we leverage to explore human trunk co-development.

SummaryUsing a 3D, stem cell-based model of human embryonic trunk development, we examine the interactions across somitic and neural tissues to better understand the dynamics of human trunk co-development.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

Obtaining structural knowledge of protein-protein interactions between a pathogen and its host can inform pathogenic mechanisms and treatment or vaccine design. Currently, there are 52 nonredundant human-pathogen interactions with known structure in the PDB, although there are 21064 with experimental support in the HPIDB, meaning that only 0.2% of known interactions have known structure. Recent improvements in structure prediction of protein complexes based on AlphaFold have made it possible to model heterodimeric complexes with very high accuracy. However, it is not known how this translates to host-pathogen interactions which share a different evolutionary relationship. Here, we analyse the structural protein-protein interaction network between ten different pathogens and their human host. We predict the structure of 9452 human-pathogen interactions of which only 10 have known structure. We find that we can model 30 interactions with an expected TM-score of [&ge;]0.9, expanding the structural knowledge in these networks three-fold.

Both rewarding and aversive stimuli have been found to trigger release, but studies have disagreed on whether the valence of a stimulus or other variables like novelty and salience are the most important. Here we report on recordings of dopamine-dependent fluorescence using a high-sensitivity dopamine indicator. We deliver an array of rewarding, aversive and mixed valence stimuli, as well as stimuli without any obvious valence. We observe that stimuli without valence, as well as the omission of expected stimuli, do not lead to large changes in fluorescence, even when these stimuli and omissions are both novel and engaging. In contrast, both rewarding and aversive stimuli lead to increases in fluorescence, with the most rewarding and most aversive stimuli leading to the largest increases. We test the effect of adding an aversive component to a rewarding stimulus and find that the increases in fluorescence are consistent with a summation of the rewarding and aversive components. We propose that dopamine release in the PFC responds to the total valence of a stimulus, in contrast with the traditional view of basal ganglia dopamine release that depends on the net valence.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

How this movement synchronization is achieved by the nervous system remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover the neural basis of body part coordination during goal-directed antennal grooming in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that unilateral or bilateral grooming of one or both antenna, respectively, arises from synchronized movements of the head, antennae, and forelegs. Simulated replay of these body part kinematics in a biomechanical model shows that this coordination makes grooming more efficient by permitting unobstructed, forceful collisions between the foreleg tibiae and antennae. Movements of one body part do not require proprioceptive sensory feedback from the others: neither amputation of the forelegs or antennae, nor immobilization of the head prevented movements of the other unperturbed body parts. By constructing a comprehensive antennal grooming network from the fly brain connectome, we find that centralized interneurons and shared premotor neurons interconnect and thus likely synchronize neck, antennal, and foreleg motor networks. A simulated activation screen of neurons in this network reveals cell classes required for the coordination of antennal movements during unilateral grooming. These cells form two coupled circuit motifs that enable robust body part synchronization: a recurrent excitatory subnetwork that promotes contralateral antennal pitch and broadcast inhibition that suppresses ipsilateral antennal pitch. Similarly centralized controllers may enable the flexible co-recruitment of multiple body parts to subserve a variety of behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795

This has created the need to develop new tools capable of utilizing these formats and performing operations similar to those carried out by traditional methods.In this paper we present ""gaftools"", a multi-purpose tool that introduces several utilities for processing graph alignments in GAF format. Gaftools enables users to index and sort alignments, with graph ordering serving as a necessary step for the sorting process.

This use of a few model systems is reasonable if major features of the immune systems evolve slowly and are conserved across most vertebrates, but may be problematic if there is substantial macroevolutionary change in immune responses. Here, we present a test of the macroevolutionary stability, across 15 species of jawed fishes, of the transcriptomic response to a standardized immune challenge. Intraperitoneal injection of an immune adjuvant (alum) induces a fibrosis response in nearly all jawed fishes, which in some species contributes to anti-helminth resistance. Despite this conserved phenotypic response, the underlying transcriptomic response is highly inconsistent across species. Although many gene orthogroups exhibit differential expression between saline versus alum-injected fish in at least one species, few orthogroups exhibit consistent differential expression across species. This result suggests that although the phenotypic response to alum (fibrosis) is highly conserved, the underlying gene regulatory architecture is very flexible and cannot readily be extrapolated from any one species to fishes (or vertebrates) more broadly. The vertebrate immune response is remarkably changeable over macroevolutionary time, requiring a diversity of model organisms to describe effectively.","NA","biorxiv",1734732506795
