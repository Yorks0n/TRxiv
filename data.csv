Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1715569393075

However, it remains challenging to accommodate more than ~10 samples per experiment without substantial departure from trusted, established protocols involving accessible instrumentation. Here, we describe a 96-sample western blot that conforms to standard 96-well plate dimensional constraints and has little operational deviation from standard western blotting. The main differences are that (i) submerged polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is operated horizontally (similar to agarose gels) as opposed to vertically, and (ii) a 6 mm thick gel is used, with 2 mm most relevant for membrane transfer (vs ~1 mm typical). Results demonstrate both wet and semi-dry transfer are compatible with this gel thickness. The major tradeoff is reduced molecular weight resolution, due primarily to less available migration distance per sample. We demonstrate proof-of-principle using gels loaded with molecular weight ladder, recombinant protein, and cell lysates. We expect the 96-well western blot will increase reproducibility, efficiency, and capacity for biological characterization relative to established western blots.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

We developed an automation workflow that enables the generation, handling, and analysis of thousands of transplastomic strains in parallel, expanded the repertoire of selection markers for chloroplast transformation, established new reporter genes, and characterized over 140 regulatory parts, including native and synthetic promoters, UTRs, and intercistronic expression elements. We integrated the system within the Phytobrick cloning standard and demonstrate several applications, including a library-based approach to develop synthetic promoter designs in plastids. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept for prototyping novel traits in plastids by introducing a chloroplast-based synthetic photorespiration pathway and demonstrating a twofold increase in biomass production. Overall, our study advances chloroplast engineering, and provides a promising platform to rapidly prototype chloroplast manipulations before their transfer into higher plants and crops.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1715569393075

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillin's roles in cell biology.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

To date, these results have been only achieved using ASAP-type sensors, as the complex photocycle of rhodopsin-based voltage indicators posed challenges for their two-photon use, restricting their application to one-photon approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that rhodopsin-based GEVIs (FRET-opsin) can be used under two-photon illumination when their peculiar light intensity dependence of kinetics and sensitivity are considered. We rationally engineer a fully genetically-encoded, rhodopsin-based voltage indicator with the brightest known fluorophore AaFP1, Jarvis, and demonstrate its utility under both one- and two-photon illumination. We also showed two-photon usability of the similar FRET-opsin sensor pAce. Our comparison of 2P scanless with fast 2P scanning illumination revealed that the latter approach is less suitable for this class of indicators and, on the contrary, both sensors responded well when scanless approaches were used. Furthermore, utilising Jarvis, we demonstrated high-fidelity, high-SNR action potential detection at kilohertz-imaging rates both in mouse hippocampal slices and in zebrafish larvae. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report of a fully genetically-encoded rhodopsin-based voltage indicator for high contrast action potential detection under two-photon illumination in vitro and in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Autoregressive language models operate on discrete tokens, whereas protein structure is inherently continuous, and generative approaches to protein design have borrowed more from image generation than language modeling. But autoregressive models do not inherently require their inputs and outputs to be discrete. Here we describe a generative autoregressive language model over the continuous space of protein backbones, where the distribution over the placement of each successive amino acid is conditioned on all preceding residues, and can be sampled from one residue after another. We show that this approach can learn to sample diverse and realistic protein chains, opening a new potential avenue for in silico protein design.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this immune strategy by instead leveraging DNA synthesis, but the identities and functions of their DNA products remain largely unknown. Here we show that DRT2 systems execute an unprecedented immunity mechanism that involves de novo gene synthesis via rolling-circle reverse transcription of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Unbiased profiling of RT-associated RNA and DNA ligands in DRT2-expressing cells revealed that reverse transcription generates concatenated cDNA repeats through programmed template jumping on the ncRNA. The presence of phage then triggers second-strand cDNA synthesis, leading to the production of long double-stranded DNA. Remarkably, this DNA product is efficiently transcribed, generating messenger RNAs that encode a stop codon-less, never-ending ORF (neo) whose translation causes potent growth arrest. Phylogenetic analyses and screening of diverse DRT2 homologs further revealed broad conservation of rolling-circle reverse transcription and Neo protein function. Our work highlights an elegant expansion of genome coding potential through RNA-templated gene creation, and challenges conventional paradigms of genetic information encoded along the one-dimensional axis of genomic DNA.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Design: Nationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation. Setting: Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024. Participants: Individuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences. Results: During autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

Within developing endochondral bones, chondrocytes at growth plate edges transition to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and other connective tissue in the marrow cavity, and in diseases such as Multiple Osteochondromas (MO) chondrocytes form abnormally around growth plates and contribute to ectopic bone. On the other hand, the inability to form new chondrocytes to maintain damaged joints contributes to the high incidence of osteoarthritis. In order to assess the ability of zebrafish to regenerate cartilage, we developed a nitroreductase-based cartilage ablation model. Following ablation at larval to adult stages, we observed new chondrocytes forming around the dead cartilage matrix, with cartilage outgrowths in ablated endochondral bones resembling the exostoses of MO. By generating a perichondrium-restricted hyal4:GFP transgenic line, we show that new chondrocytes arise from the perichondrium surrounding the ablated cartilage. In addition, we observe enriched expression of the retinoic acid (RA) synthesis gene aldh1a2 in the perichondrium following ablation, and the RA degrading enzyme gene cyp26b1 in newly forming chondrocytes. Consistent with RA signaling suppressing chondrogenesis, treatment with the RA receptor gamma agonist palovarotene, which has been used to treat MO, prevented ablation-induced chondrogenesis. Although we find that BMP signaling is also required for ablation-induced chondrogenesis, we show a distinct role for RA signaling in suppressing sox9a expression and chondrogenesis. Moreover, palovarotene resulted in a near complete loss of growth plates in uninjured zebrafish, which was due to the precocious dedifferentiation and exit of chondrocytes from the growth plate. Our findings suggest a common chondrocyte suppressive role of RA signaling within the developing growth plates and regenerating perichondrium, which may explain the growth plate defects observed when using RA agonists to treat MO.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

This paper aims to provide a summary from several ongoing and completed studies to share initial insights into the time trend and spatial distribution, the links we have observed between level of mpox cases with population density and the presence of professional sex workers (PSW) in bars within affected heath areas of Kamituga health zone. We also seek to share our initial observations on the novel characteristics of this new and emergent strain. Methods Consenting patients admitted with mpox-like symptoms to the Kamituga hospital were recruited to an observational cohort study to understand the clinical characteristics and household perceptions and treatment seeking behaviours. We mapped the demographic and clinical characteristics of all individuals between September 2023 and April 2024. Findings 371 (suspected) mpox cases were admitted to the Kamituga hospital. There were slightly more female than male cases (192/371 [52%] versus 179/371, [48%], and cases were reported from 15 health area. The majority of cases were reported in Mero (115/371 [31%]), followed by Kimbangu (65/371[18%]), Kabukungu (63/371[17%]), Asuku (47/371 [13%]), Soluluyu (19/371 [5,12%]), Katunga (17/371 [4,58%]), Kalingi, Poudriere (12/371 [3,23%]) respectively , and Poly Afia (7/371 [1,89%]). During this period, 4 deaths occurred and 4 out of 8 women who were pregnant had fetal loss . Three healthcare workers acquired infection when caring for patients.. In depth case ascertainment showed that 88,4 % of patients reported recent visits to bars for (professional) sexual interactions as a likely source of infection. Our findings suggest that the epidemic in South Kivu is driven by ttransmission in a network of professional sex workers, working in bars. The continued spread of the mpox virus in Kamituga health zone and other health zones of South -Kivu points at a critical need for cross border surveillance, and the potential for rapid vaccination of sex workers as potential intervention. Interpretation These data suggest that the rapid transmission of mpox virus is related to interactions with professional sex workers (PSW) in bars within densely populated health areas. The expanding number of cases and the recent spillover to 16 other nearby health zones of South -Kivu including a health district bordering Rwanda and Burundi stresses the need for cross border surveillance. In addition, enhanced response action is needed, including vaccinationand health eduction programmes to limit further escalation and stop this outbreak,","NA","medrxiv",1715569393075

The formation of contacts between the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), and other organelles, relies on a unique membrane environment enriched in sterols.

We found that the yeast membrane protein Yet3, the homolog of human BAP31, is localized to multiple ER contact sites. We show that Yet3 interacts with all the enzymes of the post-squalene ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and recruits them to create sterol-rich domains. Increasing sterol levels at ER contacts causes its depletion from the plasma membrane leading to a compensatory reaction and altered cell metabolism.

In contrast to prior approaches that mostly focused on protein sequence features, we employ pretrained protein language model to encode the sequence features, and natural language model for the semantic information of property descriptions. Specifically, we present FAPM, a contrastive model between natural language and protein sequence language, which combines the pretrained protein sequence model with the pretrained large language model to generate labels such as GO functional terms and catalytic activity prediction in the format of natural language. Our result shows that FAPM has learned superior representations related to protein properties, outperforming protein sequence-based or structure-based models. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance both on public benchmarks and on experimentally-annotated phage proteins that have limited known homologous sequences. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of our model to accept additional free text prompts as input, such as easily accessible taxonomy information, not only enhances its predictive performance but also improves the model's explainability. Our methodology presents a novel avenue for exploration, characterized by its potential to supersede current methodologies reliant on multiple sequence alignment for protein annotation.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which is a derivative of Chloroquine (CQ), was a WHO-recommended drug to treat COVID-19 with mixed effects. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the plausible mechanisms of HCQ actions behind its observed mixed effect. Key Results: We demonstrate that CQ-treatment significantly up-regulates mesenchymal markers and SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in cultured endothelial cells. Conclusions & Implications: The detrimental effect of HCQ in seriously ill COVID-19 patients might be due to CQ-induced increased expression of endothelial ACE2 exacerbating the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study warrants further investigation in animal models and humans and caution while prescribing HCQ to patients with an impaired renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as in hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, or chronic kidney disease; particularly with ACE-inhibitors or statin therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

However, the factors that support and broadly regulate these processes across developmental stages are largely unknown. Here, we find that IL34, a neuron-derived cytokine, is upregulated in development and plays a critical role in supporting and maintaining neuroprotective, mature microglia in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of mice. We show that IL34 mRNA and protein is upregulated in neurons in the second week of postnatal life and that this increase coincides with increases in microglia number and expression of mature, homeostatic markers, e.g., TMEM119. We also found that IL34 mRNA is higher in more active neurons, and higher in excitatory (compared to inhibitory) neurons. Genetic KO of IL34 prevents the functional maturation of microglia and results in an anxiolytic phenotype in these mice by adulthood. Acute, low dose blocking of IL34 at postnatal day (P)15 in mice decreased microglial TMEM119 expression and increased aberrant microglial phagocytosis of thalamocortical synapses within the ACC. In contrast, viral overexpression of IL34 early in life (P1-P8) caused early maturation of microglia and prevented microglial phagocytosis of thalamocortical synapses during the appropriate neurodevelopmental refinement window. Taken together, these findings establish IL34 as a key regulator of neuron-microglia crosstalk in postnatal brain development, controlling both microglial maturation and synapse engulfment.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

We designed small single domain immunogens, under 130 residues, that simultaneously present three distinct and irregular motifs from respiratory syncytial virus. These motifs together comprise nearly half of the designed proteins, and hence the overall folds are quite unusual with little global similarity to proteins in the PDB. Despite this, X-ray crystal structures confirm the accuracy of presentation of each of the motifs, and the multi-epitope design yields improved cross-reactive titers and neutralizing response compared to a single-epitope immunogen. The successful presentation of three distinct binding surfaces in a small single domain protein highlights the power of generative deep learning methods to solve complex protein design problems.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Nanopore direct RNA sequencing combined with our recent tool, Mod-p ID, enables psi mapping, transcriptome-wide, without chemical derivatization of the input RNA and/or conversion to cDNA. This method is highly efficient for detecting changes in positional psi occupancies across cell types, which can inform our understanding of the impact on gene expression. We sequenced, mapped, and compared the positional psi occupancy across six immortalized human cell lines derived from diverse tissue types. We found that lung-derived cells have the highest proportion of psi, while liver-derived cells have the lowest. Further, among a list of highly conserved sites across cell types, most are TRUB1 substrates and fall within the coding sequence. Interestingly, we identify cell type-specific sites of psi modification in ubiquitously expressed genes. We validate these sites by ruling out single-nucleotide variants, analyzing current traces, and performing enzymatic knockdowns of psi synthases. Finally, we characterize sites with multiple psi modifications on the same transcript (hypermodification type II) and found that these can be conserved or cell type-specific. Among these, we discovered examples of multiple psi modifications within the same k-mer for the first time and analyzed the effect on current distribution. Our data support the hypothesis that motif sequence and the presence of psi synthase are insufficient to drive modifications and that cell-type specific trans-acting factors play a major role in driving pseudoruridylation.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

All identified nucleus-forming phages fall within the proposed Chimalliviridae family and share a core genome of 68 unique genes including chimallin, the major nuclear shell protein. A well-studied but non-essential protein encoded by many nucleus-forming phages is PhuZ, a tubulin homolog which aids in capsid migration, nucleus rotation, and nucleus positioning. One clade that represents 24% of all currently known chimalliviruses lacks a PhuZ homolog. Here we show that Erwinia phage Asesino, one member of this PhuZ-less clade, shares a common overall replication mechanism with other characterized nucleus-forming phages despite lacking PhuZ. We show that Asesino replicates via a phage nucleus that encloses phage DNA and partitions proteins in the nuclear compartment and cytoplasm in a manner similar to previously characterized nucleus-forming phages. Consistent with a lack of PhuZ, however, we did not observe active positioning or rotation of the phage nucleus within infected cells. These data show that some nucleus-forming phages have evolved to replicate efficiently without PhuZ, providing an example of a unique variation in the nucleus-based replication pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Our study demonstrates that the interplay between condensate properties and chromatin mechanics dictates condensate growth dynamics. Through chemical dimerization, we induced condensates of various properties in the cell nuclei, revealing distinct growth mechanisms: diffusion-driven or ripening-dominated. To explain experimental observations, we developed a quantitative theory that uncovers the role of chromatin in modulating condensate growth via size-dependent pressure. We find that surface tension is a critical factor in determining whether condensates undergo elastic or Ostwald ripening. Our model predicts that different condensates are affected differently by chromatin heterogeneity, validated by experimentally perturbing chromatin organization.

A more elegant approach would be to directly reprogram the serine integrase itself to target a desired site endogenous to the genome that is different from the natural recognition site of the integrase. Here, we describe the development of a platform of Modular Integrases (the MINT platform), a versatile protein-guided genome editing method that can facilitate site-directed targeted integration of synthetic DNA into chromosomal sites.

We found that GS frequently pause or stop at pre-synaptic sites in activity-dependent manner. This behavior depends on the actin cytoskeleton and the actin-based motor protein myosin VI. Overall, our study demonstrates that neuronal activity can dynamically regulate the positioning of GS in the axon, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms underlying organelle trafficking in neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Thus far, we know little about the structuring of community functionality and the coupling between taxonomy and function over seasonal environmental gradients. To address this, we employed autonomous sampling devices and in situ sensors to investigate the taxonomic and functional dynamics of a pelagic Arctic Ocean microbiome over a four-year period. We demonstrate that the dominant prokaryotic and microeukaryotic populations exhibit recurrent, unimodal fluctuations each year, with community gene content following the same trend. The recurrent dynamics within the prokaryotic microbiome are structured into five temporal modules that represent distinct ecological states, characterised by unique taxonomic and metabolic signatures and connections to specific microeukaryotic populations and oceanographic conditions. For instance, Cand. Nitrosopumilus and the machinery to oxidise ammonia and reduce nitrite are signatures of early polar night, along with Radiolarians. In contrast, late summer is characterised by Amylibacter, sulfur compound metabolism and diverse Haptophyta lineages. Exploring the composition of modules further along with their degree of functional redundancy and the structuring of genetic diversity within functions over time revealed seasonal heterogeneity in environmental selection processes. In particular, we observe strong selection pressure on a functional level in spring while late polar night features weaker selection pressure that likely acts on an organismal level. By integrating taxonomic, functional, and environmental information, our study provides fundamental insights into how microbiomes are structured under pronounced environmental variability in understudied, yet rapidly changing polar marine ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

To elucidate the role of senEVs in inflammatory responses to senescence, we established and validated an engraftment-based senescence model in wild-type mice, enabling genetic blockade of senEV release in vivo. Our findings reveal that senEVs play a pivotal role in orchestrating the rapid clearance of senescent cells and suppressing tumor recurrence. In the absence of senEVs, recruitment of MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells into the senescence microenvironment was significantly impaired. Additionally, inhibition of senEV release redirected the primary target of senescent cell signaling from antigen presenting cells to neutrophils. Furthermore, antigen presenting cells recruited and activated CCR2+ TH17 cells, resulting in the inhibition of B cell activation. Through multimodal transcriptional and proteomic analyses, we identified six ligands specific to senEVs, implicating their involvement in promoting cell adhesion. Collectively, our findings suggest that senEVs complement the activity of secreted inflammatory mediators by recruiting and activating distinct immune cell subsets, thus facilitating the efficient clearance of senescent cells.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Here we present HydroPhage, an innovative hydrogel system for the sustained release of high-titer phages to effectively treat infections caused by MDR pathogens. Our injectable hydrogels, featuring dual-crosslinking of hyaluronic acid and PEG-based hydrogels through static covalent thioether bonds and dynamic covalent hemithioacetal crosslinks (DCC), encapsulate phages at concentration up to 10^11 PFU/mL, and achieves controlled release of 10^9 PFU daily over a week, surpassing levels of current clinical dosages, with more than 60% total phage recovery. In a preclinical mouse model of extended wound infection, compared to intravenous treatment, we demonstrate enhanced bacterial clearance by localized, high-dose, and repeated phage dosing despite the emergence of bacterial resistance to phages.

Bacteria have similarly evolved immunity proteins that sense certain components of their viral predators known as bacteriophages. Although different immunity proteins can recognize different phage-encoded triggers, individual bacterial immunity proteins have only been found to sense a single trigger during infection, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between bacterial PRRs and their ligands. Here, we demonstrate that the anti-phage defense protein CapRelSJ46 in Escherichia coli can directly bind and sense two completely unrelated and structurally different proteins using the same sensory domain, with overlapping but distinct interfaces. Our results highlight the remarkable versatility of an immune sensory domain, which may be a common property of anti-phage defense systems and enable them to keep pace with their rapidly evolving viral predators. We found that Bas11 phages harbor both trigger proteins that are sensed by CapRelSJ46 during infection, and we demonstrate that such phage can only fully evade CapRelSJ46 defense when both triggers are mutated. Our work reveals how a bacterial immune system that senses more than one trigger can help prevent phages from easily escaping detection, and it may allow detection of a broader range of phages. More generally, our findings illustrate unexpected multifactorial sensing by bacterial defense systems and complex coevolutionary relationships between them and their phage-encoded triggers.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

While immune elicitors trigger changes in plasmodesmal aperture, it is unknown how this contributes towards a full immune response. To investigate this, we developed two transgenic lines with which we could induce plasmodesmal closure independently of immune elicitors. Thus, we used the over-active CALLOSE SYNTHASE3 allele icals3m and the C-terminus of PDLP1 to drive callose deposition at plasmodesmata in response to estradiol treatment. These lines showed different degrees of plasmodesmal closure but both showed upregulation of the expression of stress responsive genes, the accumulation of salicylic acid and enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 in response to estradiol treatment. Enhanced resistance was not correlated with perturbation of the flg22-triggered ROS burst or MAPK signaling. Enhanced plasmodesmal closure using icals3m also led to the measurable accumulation of starch and sugars, decreased leaf growth, and induced leaf senescence. Additionally, induction of plasmodesmal closure using icals3m led to hypersusceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. We conclude that plasmodesmal closure itself can activate stress signaling, raising questions of how this occurs, what signal carries this information and whether these responses occur in all circumstances when plasmodesmata close across plant physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Although many computational tools for enzyme annotation were developed, sequence information is unavailable for many enzymes, known as orphan enzymes. These orphan enzymes hinder sequence similarity-based functional annotation, leading gaps in understanding the association between sequences and enzymatic reactions. Therefore, we developed DeepES, a deep learning-based tool for enzyme screening to identify orphan enzyme genes, focusing on biosynthetic gene clusters and reaction class. DeepES uses protein sequences as inputs and evaluates whether the input genes contain biosynthetic gene clusters of interest by integrating the outputs of the binary classifier for each reaction class. The validation results suggested that DeepES can capture functional similarity between protein sequences, and it can be implemented to explore orphan enzyme genes.

In mature root regions, endodermal cells coat their cell surface in a hydrophobic polymer termed suberin, which blocks solute transport across the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, specific cells adjacent to the water-conducting xylem remain unsuberized. These are termed passage cells based on the assumption that they create a passage for nutrient influx into vasculature in the otherwise sealed-off root regions. The identity and function of passage cells remain unknown, but their presence proposes the existence of individual identities within the endodermis.

Our work identifies the transcription factor MYB68 as a key regulator of suberization and endodermal lineage-specification related to passage cell formation. Through transcriptional profiling of myb68 mutants, we unravel genes with passage cell-associated expression that suggest a function in cation homeostasis.

In the year following, we applied previously established methods to quantify total reported mortality in eastern Canada for a full year October 2022, to September 2023. In this study, we (i) document the spatial, temporal and taxonomic patterns of wild bird mortality in the 12 months that followed the mass mortality event in the summer of 2022 and (ii) quantify the observed differences in mortality across the breeding season (April to September) of 2022 and 2023. In eastern Canada, there was high uncertainty about whether 2023 would bring another year of devastating HPAI-linked mortalities. Mortalities in the breeding season were 93% lower in 2023 compared to 2022 but encompassed a more taxonomically diverse array of species. We found that mortalities in the fall and winter (non-breeding season) were dominated by waterfowl, while mortalities during the spring and summer (breeding season) were dominated by seabirds. Due to a low prevalence of HPAI among the subset of tested birds, we refrained from broadly attributing reported mortalities in 2023 to HPAI. However, our analysis did identify three notable mortality events linked to HPAI, involving at least 1,646 Greater Snow Geese, 232 Canada Geese, and 212 Northern Gannets.

To address this, we employed a multimodal, data-driven approach integrating intracranial electroencephalography, pain self-reports, and facial expression quantification to characterize the neural and behavioral correlates of naturalistic acute pain in twelve epilepsy patients undergoing continuous monitoring with neural and audiovisual recordings. High self-reported pain states were associated with elevated blood pressure, increased pain medication use, and distinct facial muscle activations. Using machine learning, we successfully decoded individual participants' high versus low self-reported pain states from distributed neural activity patterns (mean AUC = 0.70), involving mesolimbic regions, striatum, and temporoparietal cortex. High self-reported pain states exhibited increased low-frequency activity in temporoparietal areas and decreased high-frequency activity in mesolimbic regions (hippocampus, cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex) compared to low pain states. This neural pain representation remained stable for hours and was modulated by pain onset and relief. Objective facial expression changes also classified self-reported pain states, with results concordant with electrophysiological predictions. Importantly, we identified transient periods of momentary pain as a distinct naturalistic acute pain measure, which could be reliably differentiated from affect-neutral periods using intracranial and facial features, albeit with neural and facial patterns distinct from self-reported pain. These findings reveal reliable neurobehavioral markers of naturalistic acute pain across contexts and timescales, underscoring the potential for developing personalized pain interventions in real-world settings.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

To make polarization cameras compatible with single-molecule detection, we developed theory to minimize field of view errors, used simulations to optimize experimental design, and developed a fast algorithm based on Stokes parameter estimation which can operate over 1000 fold faster than the state of the art, enabling near instant determination of molecular anisotropy. To aid in the adoption of POLCAM, we developed open-source image analysis software; a napari plugin for visualization of high-dimensional diffraction-limited polarization camera datasets, and a website detailing hardware installation and software use. To illustrate the potential of POLCAM in the life sciences, we applied our method to study alpha-synuclein fibrils, the actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells, fibroblast-like cells and the plasma membrane of live human T cells.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Here, we have studied the role of the Drosophila ortholog of DYRK1A, Minibrain (Mnb), in brain development. The neuroblasts (neural stem cells) that eventually give rise to differentiated neurons in the adult brain are formed from a specialized tissue in the larval optic lobe called the neuroepithelium, in a tightly regulated process. Molecular marker analysis of mnb mutants revealed alterations in the neuroepithelium and neuroblast regions of developing larval brains. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we identified the novel Mnb binding partners Ral interacting protein (Rlip) and RALBP1 associated Eps domain containing (Reps). Rlip and Reps physically and genetically interact with Mnb, and the three proteins may form a ternary complex. Mnb phosphorylates Reps, and human DYRK1A binds to the Reps orthologs REPS1 and REPS2. Furthermore, Mnb engages the small GTPase Ras-like protein A (Rala) to regulate brain and wing development. This work uncovers a previously unrecognized early role of Mnb in the neuroepithelium and defines the functions of the Mnb/Reps/Rlip/Rala signaling network in brain development","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Plants have evolved complex mechanisms to cope with fluctuating light signals. In Arabidopsis, bHLH transcription factors MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 have been shown to play a vital role in protecting plants against herbivory and necrotrophic pathogens. While the role of MYC2 in light-mediated seedling development has been studied in some detail, the role of MYC3 and MYC4 still needs to be discovered. Here, we show that MYC4 negatively regulates seedling photomorphogenesis, while the MYC3 function seems redundant. However, the genetic analysis reveals that MYC3/MYC4 together act as positive regulators of seedling photomorphogenic growth as the myc3myc4 double mutants showed exaggerated hypocotyl growth compared to myc4 single mutants and Col-0. Intriguingly, the loss of MYC2 function in the myc3myc4 double mutant background (myc2myc3myc4) resulted in further enhancement in the hypocotyl growth than myc3myc4 double mutants in WL, BL and FRL, suggesting that MYC2/3/4 together play an essential and positive role in meditating optimal seedling photomorphogenesis. Besides, MYC3/MYC4 genetically and physically interact with HY5 to partially inhibit its function in controlling hypocotyl and photo-pigment accumulation. Moreover, our results suggest that COP1 physically interacts and degrades MYC3 and MYC4 through the 26S proteasomal pathway and controls their response to dark and light for fine-tuning HY5 function and seedling photomorphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

QDR is commonly defined as a partial but more durable form of resistance and, therefore, might display a valuable target for resistance breeding. The characterization of QDR phenotypes, especially of wild crop relatives, displays a major bottleneck in deciphering QDR's genomic and regulatory background. Moreover, the relationship between QDR parameters, such as infection frequency, lag phase duration, and lesion growth rate, remains elusive. High hurdles for applying modern phenotyping technology, such as the low availability of phenotyping facilities or complex data analysis, further dampen progress in understanding QDR. Here, we applied a low-cost phenotyping system to measure lesion growth dynamics of wild tomato species (e.g., S. pennellii or S. pimpinellifolium). We provide insight into QDR diversity of wild populations and derive specific QDR strategies and their crosstalk. We show how temporally continuous observations are required to dissect end-point severity into functional resistance strategies. The results of our study show how QDR can be maintained by facilitating different defense strategies during host-parasite interaction and that the capacity of the QDR toolbox highly depends on the host's genetic context. We anticipate that the present findings display a valuable resource for more targeted functional characterization of the processes involved in QDR. Moreover, we show how modest phenotyping technology can be leveraged to help answer highly relevant biological questions.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Evidence from homogeneous liquid or flat plate cultures implicates biochemical cues -- such as variation in nutrient composition, response to chemoattractants and toxins, and inter-species signalling -- as the primary modes of bacterial interaction with their microenvironment. However, these systems fail to capture the effect of physical confinement on bacteria in their natural habitats. Bacterial niches like the pores of soil, mucus, and infected tissues are disordered microenvironments with material properties defined by their internal pore sizes and shear moduli. Here, using three-dimensional matrices that match the viscoelastic properties of gut mucus, we test how altering the physical properties of their microenvironment influences bacterial growth under confinement. We find that low aspect-ratio bacteria form compact, spherical colonies under confinement while high aspect-ratio bacteria push their progenies further outwards to create elongated colonies with a higher surface area, enabling increased access to nutrients. As a result, the population level growth of high aspect-ratio bacteria is more robust to increased physical confinement compared to that of low aspect-ratio bacteria. Thus, our results capture the first experimental evidence that physical constraints play a selective role in bacterial growth based on cell shape.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Immune cells, including T cells infiltrate the islets and gradually destroy the beta cells. Human islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells recognize peptide epitopes derived from proinsulin, particularly C-peptide. Hybrid Insulin peptides (HIPs) are neoepitopes formed by the fusion of two peptides derived from beta-cell granule proteins and are known to be the targets of pathogenic CD4+ T cells in the NOD mouse and human islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells. Proinsulin is widely recognized as a central antigen in T1D, but its role in forming HIPs is unclear. We developed a method to functionally screen TCRs derived from human islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells and applied this to the identification of new proinsulin-derived HIPs. We generated a library of 4,488 candidate HIPs formed by fusion of proinsulin fragments and predicted to bind to HLA-DQ8. This library was screened against 109 islet-infiltrating CD4+ T-cell TCRs isolated from four organ donors who had T1D. We identified 13 unique HIPs recognized by 9 different TCRs from two organ donors. HIP specific T-cell avatars responded specifically to a peptide extract from human islets. These new HIPs predominantly stimulated CD4+ T-cell proliferation in PBMCs from people with T1D in contrast to HLA-matched controls. This is the first unbiased functional, islet-infiltrating T-cell based, screen to identify proinsulin derived HIPs. It has revealed many new HIPs and a central role of proinsulin C-peptide in their formation.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Consequently, to maintain genome stability, aneuploidy must inhibit hPSC proliferation, but the mechanisms are unknown. Here, we surprisingly find that homogeneous aneuploid populations of hPSCs proliferate unlike aneuploid non-transformed somatic cells. Instead, in mosaic populations, cell non-autonomous competition between neighboring diploid and aneuploid hPSCs eliminates less fit aneuploid cells. Aneuploid hPSCs with lower Myc or higher p53 levels relative to diploid neighbors are outcompeted but conversely gain a selective advantage when Myc and p53 relative abundance switches. Thus, although hPSCs frequently missegregate chromosomes and inherently tolerate aneuploidy, Myc- and p53-driven cell competition preserves their genome integrity. These findings have important implications for the use of hPSCs in regenerative medicine and for how diploid human embryos are established despite the prevalence of aneuploidy during early development.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

This limitation primarily stems from the lack of infiltrating CD8+ T cells, which are major effectors of the anti-cancer immune response. Here, we demonstrate the effects of intratumoral (IT) injections of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine on the impairment of tumor growth in mice. Methods: Established B16F10 subcutaneous tumor models in wild type mice were used to evaluate the tumor response from IT administration of mRNA-1273. We compared treatment outcomes, immune composition, and transcriptomic effects from mRNA-1273 using survival studies, intravital imaging, flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and abscopal studies. The ability of mRNA-1273 to enhance immune checkpoint therapy response was also evaluated. Results: Tumor growth and survival studies following a single IT injection of the COVID-19 mRNA-1273 vaccine showed significant tumor suppression and prolonged survival in tumor-bearing mice. mRNA-1273 treatment resulted in a significant increase in CD8+ T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, as observed using intravital imaging and flow cytometry. Further tumor growth suppression was achieved using additional mRNA-1273 treatments. Combination administration of mRNA-1273 with immune checkpoint therapies demonstrated enhanced effects, further delaying tumor growth and improving the survival time of tumor-bearing mice.

Subsequent suppression of oxidative metabolism restrains this metabolic-epigenetic support of proinflammatory gene transcription to enforce tolerance, an immunosuppressed state of innate immune memory. Identifying biology that promotes or counters these metabolic-epigenetic changes will inform therapeutic approaches to influence proinflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunosuppressed myeloid cellular states. Here, we demonstrate that Coenzyme A (CoA) is a ""metabolic adjuvant"", as supplying exogenous CoA to macrophages both enhances the magnitude of TLR-driven proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses, and reverse tolerance, via promotion of oxidative metabolism. Extracellular CoA, which we isotopically trace to show its direct uptake by macrophages, works synergistically with tonic TLR signaling, which we demonstrate is a critical regulator of nutrient uptake, metabolism, histone acetylation, and gene expression in macrophages. Together, TLR signaling and exogenous CoA promote mitochondrial glucose oxidation, acetyl-CoA production, and TLR target gene-specific histone acetylation, enhancing metabolic-epigenetic support of proinflammatory transcriptional programming. Exogenous CoA unlocks tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-dependent TLR agonist anti-tumor activity in an in vivo breast cancer model, and promotes macrophage restriction of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila in vitro via an Irg1-dependent antimicrobial state of CoA-augmented itaconate biosynthesis. Our findings demonstrate direct acquisition of intact extracellular CoA, and the ability of this exogenously supplemented metabolic cofactor to augment a key oxidative metabolic-epigenetic pathway supporting proinflammatory and antimicrobial macrophage phenotypes.

Here, we employ in vivo Ca2+ imaging to identify and define a population of myelinated high-threshold mechanoreceptors (intradental HTMRs) that detect superficial structural damage of the tooth and initiate jaw opening to protect teeth from damage. Intradental HTMRs remain inactive when direct forces are applied to the intact tooth but become responsive to forces when the structural integrity of the tooth is compromised, and the dentin or pulp is exposed. Their terminals collectively innervate the inner dentin through overlapping receptive fields, allowing them to monitor the superficial structures of the tooth. Indeed, intradental HTMRs detect superficial enamel damage and encode its degree, and their responses persist in the absence of either PIEZO2 or Nav1.8. Optogenetic activation of intradental HTMRs triggers a rapid, jaw opening reflex via contraction of the digastric muscle. Taken together, our data indicate that intradental HTMRs serve as sentinels that guard against mechanical threats to the tooth, and their activation results in physical tooth separation to minimize irreversible structural damage. Our work provides a new perspective on the role of intradental neurons as protective rather than exclusively pain-inducing and illustrates additional diversity in the functions of interoreceptors.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

The biological mechanisms driving the IBC phenotype are relatively undefined, partially due to a lack of comprehensive, large-scale genomic studies and limited clinical cohorts. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 2457 patients with metastatic breast cancer who underwent targeted tumor-only DNA-sequencing was performed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Clinicopathologic, single nucleotide variant (SNV), copy number variant (CNV) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) comparisons were made between clinically confirmed IBC cases within a dedicated IBC center versus non-IBC cases. Results: Clinicopathologic differences between IBC and non-IBC cases were consistent with prior reports, including IBC being associated with younger age at diagnosis, higher grade, and enrichment with hormone receptor (HR)-negative and HER2-positive tumors. The most frequent somatic alterations in IBC involved TP53 (72%), ERBB2 (32%), PIK3CA (24%), CCND1 (12%), MYC (9%), FGFR1 (8%) and GATA3 (8%). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant enrichment in TP53 SNVs in IBC; particularly in HER2-positive and HR-positive disease which was associated with worse outcomes. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) did not differ substantially between IBC and non-IBC cases and a pathway analysis revealed an enrichment in NOTCH pathway alterations in HER2-positive disease. Conclusion: Taken together, this study provides a comprehensive, clinically informed landscape of somatic alterations in a large cohort of patients with IBC. Our data support higher frequency of TP53 mutations and a potential enrichment in NOTCH pathway activation, but overall; a lack of major genomic differences. These results both reinforce the importance of TP53 alterations in IBC pathogenesis as well as their influence on clinical outcomes; but also suggest additional analyses beyond somatic DNA-level changes are warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

We show enhanced AAV-HR in mice upon genetic and pharmacological upregulation of R-loops. Selecting the highly expressed Albumin gene as a model locus for genome editing in both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the R-loop prone, 3 prime end of Albumin was efficiently edited by AAV-HR, whereas the upstream R-loop-deficient region did not result in detectable vector integration. In addition, we found a positive correlation between previously reported off-target rAAV integration sites and R-loop enriched genomic regions. Thus, we conclude that high levels of R-loops, present in highly transcribed genes, promote rAAV vector genome integration. These findings may shed light on potential mechanisms for improving the safety and efficacy of genome editing by modulating R-loops and may enhance our ability to predict regions most susceptible to off-target insertional mutagenesis by rAAV vectors.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Pollinators such as bees often modify how they handle flowers with experience and such learning is generally assumed to increase collection of floral food rewards. The complexity of flower morphology also affects how quickly pollinators learn and recall how to access floral rewards from a given flower type. Because learning to handle a flower can increase extraction of food rewards (such as pollen) and often involves the pollinator altering how it interacts with the flower's reproductive organs, pollinator learning could affect pollination success. Yet how pollinator cognition and flower morphology interact to affect pollination success is unknown. We therefore asked how learning and memory of flower handling by pollen-foraging generalist bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) varied among four morphologically distinct flower types (Phacelia campanularia, Exacum affine, Solanum elaeagnifolium, and Erythranthe guttata) and affected pollen collection and pollen deposition on these flowers. We found that bees learned and remembered how to handle some flower types more quickly than others. Learning typically involved development of motor routines unique to each flower type. While bees invariably learned to improve pollen collection, how quickly bees learned and remembered each flower type did not affect pollen collection. Surprisingly, pollen deposition on flowers was not affected by bee foraging experience. Thus, even though learning benefits the bee, it does not alter female (and potentially male) fitness benefits for the plant. We discuss potential reasons for these patterns and consequences for bee behavior and flower evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Despite this, treatment options are limited and are often ineffective. The development of curative or disease-modifying treatments for children relies on a better understanding of underlying immunity in the early airway. To establish a flow cytometry reference for immune cells in the paediatric airway, we analysed 178 samples from 66 children aged between 1-15 years. This included five tissues of the upper (nasal brushings, palatine tonsils, adenotonsil) and lower (bronchial brushings, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) airway, as well as whole blood for paired analysis of local and systemic immune response. Nasal, bronchial, and alveolar samples were analysed using a 17-plex antibody panel that captures cells of immune and epithelial lineage, while tonsil, adenoid, and blood samples were analysed using a 31-plex antibody panel that extensively phenotypes mononuclear immune cells. All protocols, panels, and data are openly available, to facilitate implementation in paediatric clinical laboratories. We provide age-specific cell reference data for infancy (0-2 years), preschool (3-5 years), childhood (6-10 years) and adolescence (11-15 years) for 37 cell populations. We show tissue-specific maturation of the airway immune system across childhood, further highlighting the importance of developing age-specific references of the paediatric airway. Intra-individual, cross-tissue analysis of paired samples revealed marked correlation in immune cell proportions between paired nasal-bronchial samples, paired tonsil-adenoid samples, and paired adenoid-blood samples, which may have implications for clinical testing. Our study advances knowledge of airway immunity from infancy through to adolescence and provides an openly available control dataset to aid in interpretation of clinical findings in samples obtained from children with respiratory diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1715569393075

While previous studies assumed that PCIF1 was nuclear, cell fractionation and immunofluorescence both show that a population of PCIF1 is localized to the cytoplasm. Further, PCIF1 redistributes to stress granules upon oxidative stress. Immunoprecipitation studies with stressed cells show that PCIF1 also physically interacts with G3BP and other stress granule components. In addition, PCIF1 behaves as a stress granule component as it disassociates from stress granules upon recovery from stress. Overexpressing full-length PCIF1 also inhibits stress granule formation, while knocking out PCIF1 slows stress granule disassembly. Next, our enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) data show that PCIF1 binds mRNAs in their coding sequences rather than cap-proximal regions. Further PCIF1's association with mRNAs increased upon NaAsO2 stress. In contrast to eCLIP data, ChIP-Seq experiments show that PCIF1 is predominantly associated with transcription start sites rather than gene bodies, indicating that PCIF1's association with mature mRNA is not co-transcriptional. Collectively, our data suggest that PCIF1 has cytoplasmic RNA surveillance role(s) independent of transcription-associated cap-adjacent mRNA modification, particularly during the stress response.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

We have identified several affibodies specific to bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) with a range of binding affinities and demonstrated the ability to tune release rate of BMP-2 from affibody-conjugated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels based on affibody affinity strength. In this work, we compare the purity, structure, and activity of recombinant, bacterially-expressed BMP-2-specific affibodies with affibodies synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis. Methods: High- and low-affinity BMP-2-specific affibodies were recombinantly expressed using BL21(DE3) E. coli and chemically synthesized using microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis with Fmoc-Gly-Wang resin. The secondary structures of the affibodies and dissociation constants of affibody-BMP-2 binding were characterized by circular dichroism and biolayer interferometry, respectively. Endotoxin levels were measured using chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assays. Affibody-conjugated PEG-mal hydrogels were fabricated and loaded with BMP-2 to evaluate hydrogel capacity for controlled release, quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Results: Synthetic and recombinant affibodies were determined to be -helical by circular dichroism. The synthetic high- and low-affinity BMP-2-specific affibodies demonstrated comparable BMP-2-binding dissociation constants to their recombinant counterparts. Recombinant affibodies retained some endotoxins after purification, while endotoxins were not detected in the synthetic affibodies. High-affinity affibody-conjugated hydrogels reduced cumulative BMP-2 release compared to the low-affinity affibody-conjugated hydrogels and hydrogels without affibodies. Conclusions: Synthetic affibodies demonstrate comparable structure and function to recombinant affibodies, while reducing endotoxin contamination and increasing product yield, indicating that solid-phase peptide synthesis is a viable method of producing affibodies for controlled protein release and other applications.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Analyses of the genetic structure, diversity, ancestry, and also, coalescent-based inferences and scenario testing using Approximate Bayesian Computation, have revealed a more complex evolutionary history than previously envisioned. Indeed, according to our analysis, the current American P. vivax populations predominantly stemmed from a now-extinct European lineage, with the potential contribution also from unsampled populations, most likely of West African origin, during post-colonial human migration waves in the late 19th-century.

In this study, we first benchmark SHAPEIT and Beagle, two state-of-the-art phasing methods, on two large datasets: >8 million diverse, research-consented 23andMe, Inc. customers and the UK Biobank (UKB). We find that both perform exceptionally well. Beagle's median switch error rate (SER) (after excluding single SNP switches) in white British trios from UKB is 0.026% compared to 0.00% for European ancestry 23andMe research participants; 55.6% of European ancestry 23andMe research participants have zero non-single SNP switches, compared to 42.4% of white British trios. South Asian ancestry 23andMe research participants have the highest median SER amongst the 23andMe populations, but it is still remarkably low at 0.46%. We also investigate the relationship between identity-by-descent (IBD) and SER, finding that switch errors tend to occur in regions of little or no IBD segment coverage. SHAPEIT and Beagle excel at 'intra-chromosomal' phasing, but lack the ability to phase across chromosomes, motivating us to develop an inter-chromosomal phasing method, called HAPTIC (HAPlotype TIling and Clustering), that assigns paternal and maternal variants discretely genome-wide. Our approach uses identity-by-descent (IBD) segments to phase blocks of variants on different chromosomes. HAPTIC represents the segments a focal individual shares with their relatives as nodes in a signed graph and performs bipartite clustering on the signed graph using spectral clustering. We test HAPTIC on 1022 UKB trios, yielding a median phase error of 0.08% in regions covered by IBD segments (33.5% of sites). We also ran HAPTIC in the 23andMe database and found a median phase error rate (the rate of mismatching alleles between the inferred and true phase) of 0.92% in Europeans (93.8% of sites) and 0.09% in admixed Africans (92.7% of sites). HAPTIC's precision depends heavily on data from relatives, so will increase as datasets grow larger and more diverse. HAPTIC enables analyses that require the parent-of-origin of variants, such as association studies and ancestry inference of untyped parents.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Its downregulation can lead to perseveration, a symptom seen in several neuropsychiatric disorders. This balance is regulated by dopamine from VTADA (ventral tegmental area dopamine) neurons, which in turn are largely controlled by GABA (gamma amino-butyric acid) synapses. However, the causal relationship of these circuit elements to extinction and perseveration remain incompletely understood. Here, we employ an innovative drug targeting technology, DART (drug acutely restricted by tethering), to selectively block GABAA receptors on VTADA neurons as mice engage in Pavlovian learning. DART eliminated GABAA mediated pauses; brief decrements in VTADA activity canonically thought to drive extinction learning. However, contrary to the hypothesis that blocking VTADA pauses should eliminate extinction learning, we observed the opposite: accelerated extinction learning. Specifically, DART eliminated the naturally occurring perseveration seen in half of control mice. We saw no impact on Pavlovian conditioning, nor on other aspects of VTADA neural firing. These findings challenge canonical theories, recasting GABAA-mediated VTADA pauses from presumed facilitators of extinction to drivers of perseveration. More broadly, this study showcases the merits of targeted synaptic pharmacology, while hinting at circuit interventions for pathological perseveration.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Various methods have been developed to utilize IBD sharing for demographic inference in contemporary DNA data. Recent methodological advances have enabled the screening for IBD in ancient DNA (aDNA) data, making demographic inference based on IBD also possible for aDNA. However, aDNA data typically have varying sampling times, but most demographic inference methods designed for modern data assume that sampling is contemporaneous. Here, we present TTNE (Time-Transect Ne), which models time-transect sampling to improve inference of recent effective population size trajectories. Using simulations, we show that utilizing IBD sharing in time series has increased resolution to infer recent fluctuations in effective population sizes compared to methods that only use contemporaneous samples. Finally, we developed an approach for estimating and modeling IBD detection errors in empirical IBD analysis. To showcase the practical utility of TTNE, we applied it to two time transects of ancient genomes, individuals associated with the Corded Ware Culture (CWC) and Medieval England. In both cases, we found evidence of a growing population, a signal consistent with archaeological records.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Lipid peroxidation occurs primarily on phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Here, we show that even though extracellular lipid limitation reduces cellular PUFA levels, lipid-starved cancer cells are paradoxically more sensitive to ferroptosis. Using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics with stable isotope fatty acid labeling, we show that lipid limitation induces a fatty acid trafficking pathway in which PUFAs are liberated from triglycerides to synthesize highly unsaturated PUFAs such as arachidonic acid and adrenic acid. These PUFAs then accumulate in phospholipids, particularly ether phospholipids, to promote ferroptosis sensitivity. Therefore, PUFA levels within cancer cells do not necessarily correlate with ferroptosis susceptibility. Rather, how cancer cells respond to extracellular lipid levels by trafficking PUFAs into proper phospholipid pools dictates their sensitivity to ferroptosis.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Phage-encoded defense inhibitors have proven powerful tools to interrogate how defense systems function. A relatively common defense system is BREX (Bacteriophage exclusion); however, how BREX functions to restrict phage infection remains poorly understood. A BREX system encoded by the SXT integrative and conjugative element, VchInd5, was recently identified in Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. The lytic phage ICP1 that co-circulates with V. cholerae encodes the BREX inhibitor OrbA, but how OrbA inhibits BREX is unclear. Here, we determine that OrbA inhibits BREX using a unique mechanism from known BREX inhibitors by directly binding to the BREX component BrxC. BrxC has a functional ATPase domain that, when mutated, not only disrupts BrxC function but also alters how BrxC multimerizes. Furthermore, we find that OrbA binding disrupts BrxC-BrxC interactions. We determine that OrbA cannot bind BrxC encoded by the distantly related BREX system encoded by the SXT VchBan9, and thus fails to inhibit this BREX system that also circulates in epidemic V. cholerae. Lastly, we find that homologs of the VchInd5 BrxC are more diverse than the homologs of the VchBan9 BrxC. These data provide new insight into the function of the BrxC ATPase and highlight how phage-encoded inhibitors can disrupt phage defense systems using different mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases.

CTP binding and hydrolysis enable ParB to slide on DNA and to bridge and condense DNA, thereby dictating the size and dynamics of the tripartite ParABS complex. Several other evolutionarily distinct systems can also segregate DNA, although the full diversity of bacterial DNA partition systems is not yet known. Here, we identify a CTP-independent ParABS system that maintains a conjugative plasmid SCP2 in the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. We demonstrate that an SCP2 ParB-like protein, ParT, loads onto DNA at an 18-bp parS site and diffuses away to the adjacent DNA despite lacking an apparent CTPase domain and detectable NTPase activity. We further show that parS DNA stimulates ParT transition from loading to a diffusing state to accumulate on DNA, and ParT activates the ATPase activity of its cognate partner protein ParA. We also identify numerous structural homologs of ParT, suggesting that CTP-independent diffusion on DNA might be widespread in bacteria despite being previously unappreciated. Overall, our findings uncover a CTP-independent DNA translocation as an alternative and unanticipated mechanism for the assembly of a bacterial DNA segregation complex and suggest that CTP binding and hydrolysis is not a fundamental feature of ParABS-like systems.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

We performed single-cell-RNAseq-analysis of FACS-isolated early placodal cells, making up less than 0.4% of cells within the embryo. Differential expression analysis in comparison to epidermal cells analysed in parallel generated a repertoire of genes highly upregulated within placodal cells prior to morphogenetic changes. Furthermore, clustering and pseudo-time analysis of single-cell-sequencing data identified dynamic expression changes along the morphogenetic timeline. Our dataset provides a comprehensive resource for future studies of a simple but highly conserved morphogenetic process of tube morphogenesis. Unexpectedly, we identified a subset of genes that, although initially expressed in the very early placode, then became selectively excluded from the placode but not the surrounding epidermis, including hth, grainyhead and tollo/toll-8.

During vegetative development, AP2 represses SOC1 transcription to delay floral transition. Later, SOC1 is activated during floral transition in response to environmental cues and represses AP2 transcription. However, during floral transition and prior to its stable repression by SOC1, AP2 rapidly promotes an increase in the size, and changes in the morphology, of the SAM. Thus, direct reciprocal repression of AP2 and SOC1 couples floral transition and changes in SAM morphology, which initiate inflorescence development.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

This often leads to large datasets with complex experimental designs that need advanced comparative analysis. Concurrently, bioinformatics software and analytic approaches also become more diverse and constantly undergo improvement. Thus, there is an increased need for automated and standardized data processing and analysis pipelines, which should be efficient and flexible too. To address these, we develop the single-cell Differential Analysis and Processing Pipeline (scDAPP), a R-based workflow for comparative analysis of single cell (or nucleus) transcriptomic data between two or more groups and at the levels of single cells or ""pseudobulking"" samples. The pipeline automates many steps of pre-processing using data-learnt parameters, uses previously benchmarked software, and generates comprehensive intermediate data and final results that are valuable for both beginners and experts of scRNA-seq analysis. Moreover, the analytic reports, augmented by extensive data visualization, increase the transparency of computational analysis and parameter choices, while facilitate users to go seamlessly from raw data to biological interpretation.

However, designing pan-specific primers for viral pathogens that have high genomic variability represents a major challenge. Here, we present a bioinformatics command-line tool, called varVAMP (variable virus amplicons). It relies on multiple sequence alignments of highly variable virus sequences and enables automatic pan-specific primer design for qPCR or tiled amplicon whole genome sequencing. The varVAMP software guarantees pan-specificity by two means: it designs primers in regions with minimal variability and introduces degenerate nucleotides into primer sequences to compensate for common sequence variations. We demonstrate varVAMPs utility by designing and evaluating novel pan-specific primer schemes suitable for sequencing the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, Hepatitis E virus, rat Hepatitis E virus, Hepatitis A virus, Borna-disease-virus-1, and Poliovirus. Moreover, we established highly sensitive and specific Poliovirus qPCR assays that could potentially simplify current Poliovirus surveillance. Importantly, wet-lab and bioinformatic techniques established for SARS-CoV-2 tiled amplicon sequencing were readily transferable to these new primer schemes and will allow sequencing laboratories to extend their established methodology to other human pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

However, which lymphocyte populations are critical in AS pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we aimed to identify the key cell types mediating the genetic risk in AS using an unbiased integrative functional genomics approach.

MethodsWe integrated GWAS data with epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets of immune cells in healthy humans. To quantify enrichment of cell type-specific open chromatin regions or gene expression in AS risk loci, we used three published methods which have identified cell types for other diseases. Additionally, we performed co-localization analyses between GWAS risk loci and genetic variants associated with gene expression (eQTL) to find putative target genes of AS risk variants.

ResultsNatural killer (NK) cell-specific open chromatin regions are significantly enriched in heritability for AS, compared to other immune cell types such as T cells, B cells, and monocytes. This finding was consistent between two AS GWAS. Using RNA-seq data, we validated that genes in AS risk loci are enriched in NK cell-specific gene expression. Expression levels of AS-associated genes, such as RUNX3, TBX21, TNFRSF1A, and NPEPPS, were found to be highest in NK cells compared to five T cell subsets. Using the human Space-Time Gut Cell Atlas we found significant upregulation of AS-associated genes predominantly in NK cells. Co-localization analysis revealed four AS risk loci affecting regulation of candidate target genes in NK cells: two known loci, ERAP1 and TNFRSF1A, and two under-studied loci, ENTR1 (aka SDCCAG3) and B3GNT2.

ConclusionOur results point to NK cells as potential key drivers in the development of AS and highlight four putative target genes for functional follow-up in NK cells.","NA","medrxiv",1715569393075

However, it remains unclear to what extent the formation of such predictions taxes executive resources. Our study set out to investigate how a limitation of executive resources impacts natural language prediction on multiple timescales in a novel dual-task paradigm, and how this impact is modulated by age. Participants (N = 175; 18-85 years) read short newspaper articles, presented word by word in varying font colours. This self-paced reading task was either performed in isolation or paired with a competing n-back task (1-back or 2-back) on the words' font colour. We measured word-level reading time and block-level reading comprehension as well as n-back performance. To quantify word predictability, we estimated word surprisal on four distinct timescales (i.e., context lengths ranging from words to paragraphs) using a large language model. Under high cognitive load, adults aged 60 and over benefited most from high word predictability. Our results show that independent of timescale, higher cognitive load diminishes the benefits of high word predictability on reading time, suggesting language predictions draw on executive resources.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

In the visual cortex, studies using simple grating stimuli indicate that congruent stimuli - where the center and surround share the same orientation - are more inhibitory than when orientations are orthogonal, potentially serving redundancy reduction and predictive coding. Understanding these center-surround interactions in relation to natural image statistics is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the stimulus space, yet crucial for deciphering the neuronal code of real-world sensory processing. Utilizing large-scale recordings from mouse V1, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict and synthesize surround patterns that either optimally suppressed or enhanced responses to center stimuli, confirmed by in vivo experiments. Contrary to the notion that congruent stimuli are suppressive, we found that surrounds that completed patterns based on natural image statistics were facilitatory, while disruptive surrounds were suppressive. Applying our CNN image synthesis method in macaque V1, we discovered that pattern completion within the near surround occurred more frequently with excitatory than with inhibitory surrounds, suggesting that our results in mice are conserved in macaques. Further, experiments and model analyses confirmed previous studies reporting the opposite effect with grating stimuli in both species. Using the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset, we observed that neurons with similar feature selectivity formed excitatory connections regardless of their receptive field overlap, aligning with the pattern completion phenomenon observed for excitatory surrounds. Finally, our empirical results emerged in a normative model of perception implementing Bayesian inference, where neuronal responses are modulated by prior knowledge of natural scene statistics. In summary, our findings identify a novel relationship between contextual information and natural scene statistics and provide evidence for a role of contextual modulation in hierarchical inference","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

These neuromodulators each regulate the other, and disturbances to their coordinated signals contribute to human disorders ranging from Parkinson's Disease to depression and addiction. Pauses in the firing of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are thought to coincide with pulses in dopamine release that encode reward prediction errors (RPEs), together shaping synaptic plasticity and thereby learning. However, such models are based upon recordings from unidentified neurons, and do not incorporate the distinct characteristics of striatal subregions. Here we compare the firing of identified, individual CINs to dopamine release as unrestrained rats performed a probabilistic decision-making task. The relationships between CIN spiking, dopamine release, and behavior varied strongly by subregion. In dorsal-lateral striatum a Go! cue evoked burst-pause CIN spiking, quickly followed by a very brief (~150ms) dopamine pulse that was unrelated to RPE. In dorsal-medial striatum the same cue evoked only a CIN pause; this pause was curtailed by a movement-selective rebound in firing. Finally in ventral striatum a reward cue evoked slower, RPE-coding increases in both dopamine and CIN firing, without any distinct pause. Our results demonstrate a spatial and temporal dissociation between CIN pauses and dopamine RPE signals, and will inform new models of striatal microcircuits and their contributions to behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393075

Given their widespread influence, dysfunction in mast cells can contribute to a variety of pathologies including allergies, long COVID, and autoimmune and neuroinflammatory disorders. Despite this, the specific transcriptional mechanisms that control mast cell mediator release remain poorly understood, significantly hindering the development of effective therapeutic strategies. We found that the two proteins encoded by the transcription factor FosB, FOSB and the highly stable variant {Delta}FOSB, are robustly expressed upon stimulation in both murine and human mast cell progenitors. Motivated by these findings, we generated a novel mouse model with targeted ablation of FosB gene expression specifically in mast cells (MCFosB-) by crossing a mast cell-specific Cre reporter line (Mcpt5-Cre) with a Cre-dependent floxed FosB mouse lines. We found that mast cell progenitors derived from MCFosB- mice, compared to wild types (WT), exhibit baseline increased histamine content and vesicle numbers. Additionally, they show enhanced calcium mobilization, degranulation, and histamine release following allergy-related IgE-mediated stimulation, along with heightened IL-6 release in response to infection-like LPS stimulation. In vivo experiments with IgE-mediated and LPS challenges revealed that MCFosB- mice experience greater drops in body temperature, heightened activation of tissue-resident mast cells, and increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators compared to their WT counterparts. These findings suggest that FosB products play a crucial regulatory role in moderating stimulus-induced mast cell activation in response to both IgE and LPS stimuli. Lastly, by integrating CUT&RUN and RNAseq data, we identified several genes targeted by {Delta}FOSB that could mediate these observed effects, including Mir155hg, CLCF1, DUSP4, and Trib1. Together, this study provides the first evidence that FOSB/{Delta}FOSB modulate mast cell functions and provides a new possible target for therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating mast cell-related diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393076

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393076

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1715569393076

However, we and others have shown that LNPs induce severe inflammation, and massively aggravate pre-existing inflammation. Here, using structure-function screening of lipids and analyses of signaling pathways, we elucidate the mechanisms of LNP-associated inflammation and demonstrate solutions. We show that LNPs hallmark feature, endosomal escape, which is necessary for RNA expression, also directly triggers inflammation by causing endosomal membrane damage. Large, irreparable, endosomal holes are recognized by cytosolic proteins called galectins, which bind to sugars on the inner endosomal membrane and then regulate downstream inflammation. We find that inhibition of galectins abrogates LNP-associated inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. We show that rapidly biodegradable ionizable lipids can preferentially create endosomal holes that are smaller in size and reparable by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. Ionizable lipids producing such ESCRT-recruiting endosomal holes can produce high expression from cargo mRNA with minimal inflammation. Finally, we show that both routes to non-inflammatory LNPs, either galectin inhibition or ESCRT-recruiting ionizable lipids, are compatible with therapeutic mRNAs that ameliorate inflammation in disease models. LNPs without galectin inhibition or biodegradable ionizable lipids lead to severe exacerbation of inflammation in these models. In summary, endosomal escape induces endosomal membrane damage that can lead to inflammation. However, the inflammation can be controlled by inhibiting galectins (large hole detectors) or by using biodegradable lipids, which create smaller holes that are reparable by the ESCRT pathway. These strategies should lead to generally safer LNPs that can be used to treat inflammatory diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393076

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393076

Timely identification of the fetal red blood cell antigen genotype for the antigen to which the pregnant person is alloimmunized is vital for determining fetal risk for HDFN and guiding management. Presently in the US, recommended care is to determine fetal antigen genotype with reproductive partner testing and/or amniocentesis. This approach has many limitations, including availability of reproductive partner testing, risk of nonpaternity, and low uptake of invasive testing such as amniocentesis. These barriers to obtaining fetal antigen genotype information lead to pregnancies not at risk for HDFN undergoing burdensome monitoring and, in some cases, unnecessary intervention. PCR-based qualitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping is available in Europe, however, it is offered at later gestational ages, may require a repeat sample, has a higher frequency of inconclusive results for individuals of non-European ancestry, and entails logistical challenges related to shipping and insurance coverage for patients in the US. The availability of a NGS-based quantitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping in the US that is robust for diverse populations and applicable for singleton and twin pregnancies starting at 10 weeks gestation presents an opportunity to assess performance.

MethodsPatients with alloimmunized pregnancies undergoing clinical fetal antigen cfDNA analysis were recruited to the study along with the neonates resulting from the pregnancies. The laboratory issued the results prospectively as a part of clinical care. After delivery, neonatal buccal swabs were sent to an outside laboratory, blinded to the fetal cfDNA results, for antigen genotyping, and the results were compared. Concordance was reported for the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis for antigens to which the pregnant person was alloimmunized as well as for all antigens for which the pregnant person was genotype negative.

ResultsWe observed complete concordance between the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis result and neonatal genotypes for 503 calls, for 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV across a racial and ethnically diverse cohort.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that cfDNA analysis for determining fetal antigen genotype is more accurate than real-life application of the current recommendations, ie., partner testing and amniocentesis, in a diverse US population. In addition, this noninvasive approach reduces barriers to obtaining timely, accurate information about fetal antigen genotype. These results support the routine implementation of fetal antigen cfDNA analysis to guide care of alloimmunized pregnancies in the US.","NA","medrxiv",1715569393076

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

Future DirectionsThis work paves the way for further development of MDL-001 and research for other broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that target the RdRp Thumb-1 domain.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393076

This study introduces our GALILEO AI drug discovery platform and its foundational ChemPrint model, designed to improve the efficiency of drug discovery. Addressing the challenges of low hit rates and the difficulty in exploring novel chemical spaces, this platform adopts adaptive molecular embeddings and stringent model training environments to enhance predictive capabilities and navigate uncharted molecular territories. We validate this approach through a case study targeting the AXL and BRD4 oncology targets, where ChemPrint achieved a 45.5% in vitro hit rate and identified 20 novel acting compounds. These compounds exhibited substantial chemical novelty, with an average Tanimoto similarity score of 0.32 to their training set, significantly diverging from known compounds and demonstrating ChemPrints capability to extrapolate, surpassing traditional benchmarks and industry standards. This underscores the platforms ability to bridge the gap between the potential of AI and its practical application in therapeutic discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393076

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1715569393076

Although AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-M) has the potential to fill this knowledge gap, standard AF-M confidence metrics do not reliably separate relevant PPIs from an abundance of false positive predictions. To address this limitation, we used machine learning on well curated datasets to train a Structure Prediction and Omics informed Classifier called SPOC that shows excellent performance in separating true and false PPIs, including in proteome-wide screens. We applied SPOC to an all-by-all matrix of nearly 300 human genome maintenance proteins, generating [~]40,000 predictions that can be viewed at predictomes.org, where users can also score their own predictions with SPOC. High confidence PPIs discovered using our approach suggest novel hypotheses in genome maintenance.

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393076

We investigated the association between long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 and all-cause mortality and mortality from a wide range of specific causes in all 3,108 counties in the contiguous U.S., 2007-2020. Monthly county-level mortality data were collected from the National Center for Health Statistics. Wildfire smoke PM2.5 concentration was derived from a 10x10 km2 resolution spatiotemporal model. Controlling for non-smoke PM2.5, air temperature, and unmeasured spatial and temporal confounders, we found a non-linear association between 12-month moving average concentration of smoke PM2.5 and monthly all-cause mortality rate. Relative to a month with the long-term smoke PM2.5 exposure below 0.1 g/m3, all-cause mortality increased by 0.40-1.54 and 3.65 deaths per 100,000 people per month when the 12-month moving average of PM2.5 concentration was of 0.1-5 and 5+ g/m3, respectively. Cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease, digestive, endocrine, diabetes, mental, suicide, and chronic kidney disease mortality were all found to be associated with long-term wildfire smoke PM2.5 exposure. Smoke PM2.5 contributed to approximately 30,180 all-cause deaths/year (95% CI: 21,449, 38,910) in the contiguous U.S. Higher smoke PM2.5-related increases in mortality rates were found for people aged 65 above and racial minority populations. Positive interaction effects with extreme heat were also observed. Our study identified the detrimental effects of long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 on a wide range of mortality outcomes, underscoring the need for public health actions and communication to prepare communities and individuals to mitigate smoke exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1715569393076

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715569393076
