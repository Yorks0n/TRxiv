We included 1,864,637 children and adolescents under 21 from 19 children's hospitals and health institutions in the US with at least six months of follow-up time between March 2020 and May 2023. We divided the patients into three strata: patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) during the acute phase (within 28 days) of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and patients without pre-existing CKD or AKI. We defined a set of adverse kidney outcomes for each stratum and examined the outcomes within the post-acute and chronic phases after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In each stratum, compared with the non-infected group, patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes. For patients without pre-existing CKD, there were increased risks of CKD stage 2+ (HR 1.20; 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) and CKD stage 3+ (HR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.15-1.59) during the post-acute phase (28 days to 365 days) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, children and adolescents with pre-existing CKD and those who experienced AKI were at increased risk of progression to a composite outcome defined by at least 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2, End Stage Kidney Disease diagnosis, dialysis, or transplant.","NA","medrxiv",1719526084014

Human genetic studies established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from patient brains1. All diseases studied to date have been characterised by the self-assembly of a single intracellular protein in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) Types A and B. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP Type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/284-N345 and ANXA11 residues L39-L74 from their respective low-complexity domains (LCDs). Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11 previously implicated in protein-protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as a ~22 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections confirmed the co-localisation of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP Type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP Type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word  she, to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells preferred noun.

DNA repair is especially understudied in nondividing cells like neurons, which must withstand decades of DNA damage without replicating. This lack of knowledge limits the efficiency and precision of genome editing in clinically relevant cells. To address this, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons to examine how postmitotic human neurons repair Cas9-induced DNA damage. We discovered that neurons can take weeks to fully resolve this damage, compared to just days in isogenic iPSCs. Furthermore, Cas9-treated neurons upregulated unexpected DNA repair genes, including factors canonically associated with replication. Manipulating this response with chemical or genetic perturbations allowed us to direct neuronal repair toward desired editing outcomes. By studying DNA repair in postmitotic human cells, we uncovered unforeseen challenges and opportunities for precise therapeutic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Although a few natural products have been shown to protect bacteria from phage infection, the prevalence and diversity of chemical anti-phage defense remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a novel family of over 2000 lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters from Actinobacteria that participate in anti-phage defense, which we named lanthiphages. Lanthiphages colocalize with other anti-phage systems in defense islands. We demonstrate that native lanthiphage expression protects the model strain Streptomyces coelicolor against diverse phages. Heterologous expression of four additional lanthiphage pathways shows that the anti-phage function is conserved across this family of biosynthetic gene clusters. Finally, we demonstrate that lanthiphage expression leads to the production of a novel compound and alters phage transcription. Our findings highlight that biosynthetic gene clusters with anti-phage functions can be successfully identified through genomic analysis. This work paves the way for the systematic mining of anti-phage natural products, which could constitute a novel reservoir of antiviral drugs.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Previous studies indicate that this is likely due to some form of indirect assortative mating but there is not a consistent understanding of this process. Understanding indirect assortment is crucial for correctly adjusting for assortative mating, and for understanding intergenerational transmission. We attribute previous inconsistencies to idiosyncratic models and inconsistent use of relevant terms. In this paper, we develop a new framework for understanding indirect assortative mating and provide updated definitions of key terms. We then develop a model (the iAM-ACE-model) that can use partners of twins and siblings to distinguish the degree of assortment on genetic, social, and individual characteristics. We also expand this model to include children of twins and siblings (the iAM-COTS model), allowing us to explain parent-offspring similarity while accounting for indirect assortative mating and geneenvironment correlations. We apply the models on educational attainment using 1,529,144 individuals in 209,792 extended families from Norwegian registry data and the Norwegian Twin Registry. The analysis suggests that partners correlate .67 (95% CIs: .66, .70) on a latent sorting factor associated with educational attainment, which we estimate to be about 30% (26%, 35%) heritable, 42% (37%, 47%) sibling-shared environment, 8% (4%, 13%) twin-shared environment, 17% (16%, 19%) gene-environment correlations, and 3% (2%, 5%) non-shared environment. The implied genotypic correlation between partners (r = .33) is comparable to earlier studies, and higher than expected under direct assortment. Most of the parent-offspring correlation (r = .33) was attributable to passive genetic transmission (62%), with the rest attributable to passive environmental transmission (23%) and direct phenotypic transmission (15%). Environmental transmission was estimated lower in alternative models that assumed direct assortment, but these did not fit the data well.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Inspired by DNA viruses that inhibit this pathway for replication, we co-loaded endogenous lipids that inhibit STING into pDNA-LNPs. Specifically, loading nitro-oleic acid (NOA) into pDNA-LNPs (NOA-pDNA-LNPs) ameliorates serious inflammatory responses in vivo enabling prolonged transgene expression (at least 1 month). Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to iteratively optimize NOA-pDNA-LNPs expression by performing a small LNP formulation screen, driving up expression 50-fold in vitro. Thus, NOA-pDNA-LNPs, and pDNA-LNPs co-loaded with other bioactive molecules, will provide a major new tool in the genetic medicine toolbox, leveraging the power of DNAs long-term and promoter-controlled expression.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Actinoporins are a family of -pore-forming proteins that bind specifically to sphingomyelin-containing lipid membranes, where they oligomerize and form transmembrane pores. The numerous contacts they form with the lipid membrane make them an exemplary object for studying the different roles that lipids play in the structure and function of membrane proteins. Through a comprehensive cryo-electron microscopic analysis of a pore formed by an actinoporin Fav from the coral Orbicella faveolata, we show that the octameric pore interacts with 112 lipids in the upper leaflet of the membrane. The structures of Fav pores formed on different lipid membranes reveal the different roles of lipids and demonstrate that the actinoporin surface is perfectly suited for binding multiple receptor sphingomyelin molecules. When cholesterol is present in the membrane, it forms nanodomains associated with the pore, leading to a tighter arrangement of lipids, which in turn increases the stability of the pores. Atomistic simulations support the structural data, show that the protein-bound lipids are not mobile, and reveal additional effects of the pore on the lipid membrane. Overall, these data reveal a complex network of protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions, and an underrated role of lipids in the structure and function of transmembrane protein complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

SWI/SNF subunits are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. These mutations are often heterozygous loss-of-function alleles, indicating a dosage-sensitive role for SWI/SNF subunits in chromatin regulation. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate SWI/SNF subunit dosage to ensure proper complex assembly remain largely unexplored. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen, using epigenome editing in mouse embryonic stem cells, and identified Mlf2 and Rbm15 as regulators of SWI/SNF complex activity. First, we show that MLF2, a poorly characterized chaperone protein, regulates a subset of SWI/SNF target genes by promoting chromatin remodeling activity. Next, we find that RBM15, part of the m6A RNA methylation writer complex, controls m6A modifications on specific SWI/SNF mRNAs to regulate protein levels of these subunits. Misregulation of m6A methylation causes overexpression of core SWI/SNF subunits leading to the assembly of incomplete complexes lacking the catalytic ATPase/ARP subunits. These data indicate that targeting modulators of SWI/SNF complex assembly may offer a potent therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with impaired chromatin remodeling.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we investigated how interactions between GABAARs and nAChRs influence dopaminergic axon excitability. Direct axonal recordings showed that benzodiazepine application suppresses subthreshold axonal input from cholinergic interneurons (CINs). In imaging experiments, we used the first temporal derivative of presynaptic calcium signals to distinguish between direct- and nAChR-evoked activity in dopaminergic axons. We found that GABAAR antagonism with gabazine selectively enhanced nAChR-evoked axonal signals. Acetylcholine release was unchanged in gabazine suggesting that GABAARs located on dopaminergic axons, but not CINs, mediated this enhancement. Unexpectedly, we found that a widely used GABAAR antagonist, picrotoxin, inhibits axonal nAChRs and should be used cautiously for striatal circuit analysis. Overall, we demonstrate that GABAARs on dopaminergic axons regulate integration of nicotinic input to shape presynaptic excitability.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Pathological anxiety is prevalent in up to 59% of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis complex (TSC)2, a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by loss-of-function mutations in genes for Tuberin (Tsc2) and/or Hamartin (Tsc1) that together comprise the eponymous protein complex. Here, we generated cell type-specific heterozygous knockout of Tsc2 in cells expressing oxytocin receptor (OTRCs) to model pathological anxiety-like behaviors observed in TSC patient population. The stress of prolonged social isolation induces a sustained negative affective state that precipitates behavioral avoidance, often by aberrant oxytocin signaling in the limbic forebrain3,4. In response to social isolation, there were striking sex differences in stress susceptibility in conditional heterozygote mice when encountering situations of approach-avoidance conflict. Socially isolated male mutants exhibited behavioral avoidance in anxiogenic environments and sought more social interaction for buffering of stress. In contrast, female mutants developed resilience during social isolation and approached anxiogenic environments, while devaluing social interaction. Systemic and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-specific inhibition of downstream effector of TSC, the integrated stress response (ISR), rescued behavioral approach toward anxiogenic environments and conspecifics in male and female mutant mice respectively. Further, we found that Tsc2 deletion in OTRCs leads to OTR-signaling elicited network suppression, i.e., hypofrontality, in male mPFC, which is relieved by inhibiting the ISR. Our findings present evidence in support of a sexually dimorphic role of prefrontal OTRCs in regulating emotional responses in anxiogenic environments, which goes awry in TSC. Our work has broader implications for developing effective treatments for subtypes of anxiety disorders that are characterized by cell-autonomous ISR and prefrontal network suppression.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Most of these proteins are synthesized with N-terminal presequences which serve as mitochondrial targeting signals. Presequences consistently form amphipathic helices, but they considerably differ in respect to their primary structure and length. Here we show that presequences can be classified into seven different groups based on their specific features. Using a test set of different presequences, we observed that group A presequences endow precursor proteins with improved in vitro import characteristics. We developed IQ-Compete (for Import and de-Quenching Competition assay), a novel assay based on fluorescence de-quenching, to monitor the import efficiencies of mitochondrial precursors in vivo. With this assay, we confirmed the increased import competence of group A presequences. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the presequence of the group A protein Oxa1 specifically recruits the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) containing protein TOMM34 to the cytosolic precursor protein. TOMM34 apparently serves as a presequence-specific targeting factor which increases the import efficiency of a specific subset of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Our results suggest that presequences contain a protein-specific priority code that encrypts the targeting mechanism of individual mitochondrial precursor proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

HARs include transcriptional enhancers with human-specific activity and have been implicated in the evolution of the human brain. However, our understanding of how HARs contributed to uniquely human features of the brain is hindered by a lack of insight into the genes and pathways that HARs regulate. It is unclear whether HARs acted by altering the expression of gene targets conserved between HARs and their chimpanzee orthologs or by gaining new gene tar-gets in human, a mechanism termed enhancer hijacking. We generated a high-resolution map of chromatin interactions for 1,590 HARs and their orthologs in human and chimpanzee neural stem cells (NSCs) to comprehensively identify gene targets in both species. HARs and their chimpanzee orthologs targeted a conserved set of 2,963 genes enriched for neurodevelopmental processes in-cluding neurogenesis and synaptic transmission. Changes in HAR enhancer activity were correlat-ed with changes in conserved gene target expression. Conserved targets were enriched among genes differentially expressed between human and chimpanzee NSCs or between human and non-human primate developing and adult brain. Species-specific HAR gene targets did not converge on known biological functions and were not significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes, suggesting that HARs did not alter gene expression via enhancer hijacking. HAR gene tar-gets, including differentially expressed targets, also showed cell type-specific expression patterns in the developing human brain, including outer radial glia, which are hypothesized to contribute to human cortical expansion. Our findings support that HARs influenced human brain evolution by altering the expression of conserved gene targets and provide the means to functionally link HARs with novel human brain features.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

These processes occur over timescales which range from milliseconds to days. While various strategies exist to study integrin function across biological scales from cell to tissue, they are often chronic and fail to target specific cell-cell interactions acutely. We engineered cells to rapidly alter cell behavior by downregulating the surface population of 5{beta}1 integrins through hot-wired clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This method allows for inducible, specific internalization of 5{beta}1 integrins, achieving acute downregulation across various cell lines in 5-30 minutes. We show that induced internalization of 5{beta}1 decreases the cell area, causes uptake of extracellular fibronectin, and decreases the rate of tumor spheroid compaction. This targeted control of multiscale processes by rapid downregulation of this important class of cell surface receptors demonstrates that hot-wired endocytosis is a useful tool to acutely modulate cell biology.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

The escalating threat of artificial light at night (ALAN) presents unique challenges for measuring the visual impact of light pollution, requiring measurement at low light levels across the human-visible and ultraviolet ranges, across all viewing angles, and often with high within-scene contrast. Here I present a hyperspectral open-source imaging system (HOSI), an innovative and low-cost solution for collecting full-field hyperspectral data. The system uses a Hamamatsu C12880MA micro spectrometer to take single-point measurements, together with a motorised gimbal for spatial control. The hardware uses off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts, costing around GBP350 in total. The system can run directly from a computer or smartphone with a graphical user interface, making it highly portable and user-friendly. The HOSI system can take panoramic hyperspectral images that meet the difficult requirements of ALAN research, sensitive to low light around 0.001 cd.m-2, across 320-880nm range with spectral resolution of ~9nm (FWHM) and spatial resolution of ~0.2 degrees. The independent exposure of each pixel also allows for an extremely wide dynamic range that can encompass typical natural and artificially illuminated scenes, with sample night-time scans achieving peak-to-peak dynamic ranges of >50,000:1. This system's adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and open-source nature position it as a valuable tool for researchers investigating the complex relationships between light, environment, behaviour, ecology, and biodiversity, with further potential uses in many other fields.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

It remains unknown whether CISSc require accessory proteins to function.

Here we characterize the putative membrane adaptor CisA, a conserved factor in CISSc gene clusters across Streptomyces species. We show by cryo-electron tomography imaging and in vivo assays that CISSc contraction and function depend on CisA. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we provide an atomic model of the extended CISSc apparatus; however, CisA is not part of the complex. Instead, our findings show that CisA is a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic N-terminus predicted to interact with CISSc components, thereby providing a possible mechanism for mediating CISSc recruitment to the membrane and subsequent firing.

Our work shows that CIS function in multicellular bacteria is distinct from Type 6 Secretion Systems and extracellular CIS, and possibly evolved due to the role of CISSc in regulated cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

We then undertook mechanistic studies to test causality for the observed associations using the zebrafish larval Mycobacterium marinum infection model. Transcriptional profiling of human immune recall responses to tuberculin skin test (TST) challenge, a surrogate for immune responses to TB in the lung, revealed that type I interferon activity in the TST transcriptome was inversely associated with radiological disease severity. Abrogation of type I interferon signalling, achieved by CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of stat2, led to increased susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to M. marinum infection, as a result of reduced recruitment of myeloid cells required to restrict mycobacterial growth, to the site of disease. Our data support a host protective role for type I interferon responses in mycobacterial infection, with potential applications for risk-stratification of adverse outcomes and development of a host-directed therapy to mitigate against severe disease.","NA","medrxiv",1719526084014

We found that delay interval led to an overestimation in the reproduction task but did not lead to any bias in the perception of time in the time discrimination task. Delay intervals affected perception of time when subjects had to actively reproduce the perceived interval, but not when subjects were going to just recall the content of the working memory. In a subsequent Bayesian modeling, we showed that in the reproduction task, subject updated their measurement of the stimulus on the current trial(likelihood), based on the delay interval, rather than changes in motor system, or updating prior based on the delay interval.

Thus, estimating the dog population is fundamental for planning, implementing, and evaluating public health programs. However, dog population estimation is time-consuming, requires many field personnel, may be inaccurate and unreliable, and is not without danger. Our objective was to validate a remote methodology for estimating the population of free-roaming dogs using Google Street View (GSV). Our target populations were free-roaming dogs from Arequipa, Peru, a rabies-affected area. Adopting a citizen science approach, and using social media, we recruited online citizen scientists from Arequipa and other regions and trained them to use GSV to identify and count free-roaming dogs in 26 urban and periurban communities. We used correlation metrics and negative binomial models to compare the counts of dogs identified in the GSV imagery with accurate counts of free-roaming owned dogs estimated via door-to-door surveys. In total, citizen scientists detected 868 dogs using GSV and using door-to-door surveys we estimated 909 free-roaming dogs across those 26 communities (Pearsons coefficient was r=0.73, p < 0.001). Our model predicted that for each free-roaming dog detected with GSV in urban areas, there were 1.03 owned dogs with free access to the street (p < 0.001). The type of community, urban versus periurban, did not have an important effect on the model, but fitting the models in periurban communities was difficult because of the sparsity of high-resolution GSV images in those areas. Using GSV imagery for estimating dog populations is a promising tool in urban areas. Citizen scientists can help to generate information for disease control programs in places with insufficient resources.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Plants actively guard these openings through defense mechanisms that have been described extensively for stomates, the most common points of entry. However, bacteria from the genus Xanthomonas have specialized in that they enter their host via hydathodes--a poorly studied organ at the leaf margin involved in guttation. While hydathodes can mount an effective immune response against bacteria, a dedicated perception mechanism still needs to be discovered. To identify a hydathode-specific immune receptor, we mapped a novel resistance gene against X. campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) in Arabidopsis using an inoculation procedure that promotes natural entry via hydathodes. Using Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) between susceptible accession Oy-0 and resistant Col-0, a QTL for resistance was identified on the right arm of Chromosome 5 in Col-0. Combining this finding with results of a genome-wide association analysis, a single candidate gene was fine-mapped that encoded a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (CNL) immune receptor protein called SUPPRESSOR OF TOPP4 1 (SUT1). Whereas the ZAR1 immune receptor acts in the vasculature against Xcc, we establish that SUT1 already restricts Xcc in hydathodes but is ineffective in the vasculature. In corroboration, we confirm promoter activity of SUT1 in the epithem tissue within hydathodes. Altogether, we provide evidence for an NLR that confers hydathode-specific resistance in Arabidopsis against infection by Xcc.

Author summaryBlack rot disease, caused by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), is an economically relevant disease of cabbage crops. Xcc is rather unique in that it enters the plant interior through specialized organs at the edge of the leaf. These structures called hydathodes contain water pores and are involved in leaf water regulation. Although we know that hydathodes can mount an immune response against these bacteria, specific immune receptors still need to be discovered. In our search for hydathode resistance mechanisms, we use the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to identify genetic targets that could be translated to cabbage breeding practices. Here, by screening large populations of genetically diverse Arabidopsis plants, we could pinpoint a genetic locus that is involved in hydathode resistance. On this locus, we identified a gene, SUT1, that confers resistance against Xcc, restricting early hydathode colonization by the bacteria and reducing subsequent disease symptoms. Interestingly, this resistance is ineffective in later stages of infection when the bacteria colonize the plant vascular system. Therefore, this study provides new insights in hydathode-specific resistance and opens doors for more research on these tissue- or organ-specific resistance mechanisms in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Pirfenidone treatment resulted in an upregulation of reproductive function-related genes at 8.5 months and a downregulation of inflammatory genes at 12 months of age. These findings demonstrate that reducing the fibroinflammatory ovarian microenvironment improves ovarian function, thereby supporting modulating the ovarian environment as a therapeutic avenue to extend reproductive longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

This is especially the case in challenging listening conditions, such as in real-life social environments. Autism has been associated with atypicalities in integrating audio-visual information, potentially underlying social difficulties in this population. The present study investigated multisensory integration (MSI) in speech processing among autistic (N=35) and neurotypical (N=35) adults. Participants performed a speech-in-noise task in a realistic multispeaker social scenario with audio-visual, auditory, or visual trials while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. The neurotypical group demonstrated a non-linear audio-visual interaction in alpha suppression, whereas the autistic group showed merely additive processing of these same inputs. Despite these differences in neural correlates, both groups achieved similar behavioural audio-visual facilitation outcomes. These findings suggest that although autistic and neurotypical brains might process multisensory cues differently, they achieve comparable benefits from audio-visual speech. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on MSI atypicalities in autism.","NA","medrxiv",1719526084014

Vimentin is important for proper cellular adhesion and force generation, which are critical to cell migration; yet the vimentin cytoskeleton also hinders the ability of cells to squeeze through small pores in ECM, resisting migration. To identify the role of vimentin in collective cell migration, we generate spheroids of wide-type and vimentin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) and embed them in a 3D collagen matrix. We find that loss of vimentin significantly impairs the ability of the spheroid to collectively expand through collagen networks and remodel the collagen network. Traction force analysis reveals that vimentin null spheroids exert less contractile force than their wild-type counterparts. In addition, spheroids made of mEFs with only vimentin unit length filaments (ULFs) exhibit similar behavior as vimentin-null spheroids, suggesting filamentous vimentin is required to promote 3D collective cell migration. We find the vimentin-mediated collective cell expansion is dependent on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) degradation of the collagen matrix. Further, 3D vertex model simulation of spheroid and embedded ECM indicates that wild-type spheroids behave more fluid-like, enabling more active pulling and reconstructing the surrounding collagen network. Altogether, these results signify that VIF plays a critical role in enhancing migratory persistence in 3D matrix environments through MMP transportation and tissue fluidity.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Because of that, they have been closely linked to the evolution of Earths environments. However, determining the evolutionary history of sponges has posed challenges. Molecular divergence times have pointed to a Tonian or Cryogenian origin for sponges. This contrasts with the oldest unequivocal fossil evidence for sponges, consisting of isolated siliceous spicules from the latest Ediacaran, resulting in a 150-million-mismatch with molecular clock estimates. This mismatch may arise because molecular clock estimates are inaccurate, the fossil record is incomplete, and/or the fossil record has been misinterpreted in the calibration of molecular clock analyses or some combination of the above. To resolve the deep evolutionary history of sponges we compiled an extensive phylogenomic dataset of sponges, revised fossil calibration evidence to derive a new phylogeny and timescale for sponge evolution, and investigated the evolutionary origin of the sponge spicules. Our results confirm that sponges include two main lineages: Silicea (Hexactinellida plus Demospongiae) and Calcarea plus Homoscleromorpha. Our molecular clock analyses identify an early Ediacaran estimate for the crown ancestor of sponges. Our study of spicule evolution shows that neither the last common sponge ancestor, nor the last common ancestors of Silicea and (Calcarea plus Homoscleromorpha) possessed siliceous spicules, which independently evolved four times in sponges: once in Hexactinellida, twice in Demospongiae, and once in Homoscleromorpha. Furthermore, diversification rate analyses demonstrate that the origin of spicules did not align with species radiations within the phylum. Our dating analyses substantially reduce the mismatch between molecular clock estimates for the antiquity of sponges and their fossil record. Our study of the evolutionary history of siliceous spicules reconciles the remaining difference as a consequence of crown-sponges primitively lacking siliceous spicules. As such we demonstrate the power of combining molecular and palaeontological approaches to establishing evolutionary timescales which together allow us to calibrate genome evolution to geological time and read evolutionary history within the gaps in the fossil record.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Although the process is now understood to be of mechanochemical origin, direct mechanical characterization and associated biochemical underpinnings are lacking. Here, we employ tissue-scale stress and compressibility measurements and theoretical modeling to unveil a mechanical imbalance between normal and transformed cells, which drives cell competition. In the mouse intestinal epithelium and epithelial monolayer, transformed cells get compacted during competition. Stress microscopy reveals an emergent compressive stress at the transformed loci leading to this compaction. A cell-based self-propelled Voronoi model predicts that this compressive stress originates from a difference in the collective compressibility of the competing populations. A new collective compressibility measurement technique named gel compression microscopy then elucidates a two-fold higher compressibility of the transformed population than the normal population. Mechanistically, weakened cell-cell adhesions due to reduced junctional abundance of E-cadherin in the transformed cells render them collectively more compressible than normal cells. Taken together, our findings unveil a mechanical basis for epithelial homeostasis against oncogenic transformations with implications in epithelial defense against cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

However, compared to other K2P channels, little is known about the structural and functional properties of THIK-1. Here we present a 3.16 Angstrom resolution cryoEM structure of human THIK-1 that reveals several unique features, in particular, a tyrosine in M4 (Y273) which contributes to a lower 'Y-gate' that opens upon activation by several physiologically-relevant signalling pathways. We further demonstrate that binding of linoleic acid within a modulatory pocket adjacent to the filter also activates THIK-1, and that halothane inhibition involves a binding site within the inner cavity resulting in changes to the Y-gate. Finally, the extracellular cap domain contains positively-charged residues that line the ion exit pathway and which contribute to the unique biophysical properties of this channel. Overall, our results provide important insights into the structural basis of THIK1 function and identify distinct regulatory sites that expand its potential as a drug target for the modulation of microglial function.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Here, we investigate how subjective, physiological, and behavioural indicators of arousal and attentional state vary as a function of cardiac activity and brain-heart coupling. Combined electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and pupillometric records were obtained from 25 healthy human adults during the performance of a sustained attention to response task (SART). Thought-probes were intermittently administered during the SART to collect subjective reports of attentional state (i.e., on-task, mind-wandering, mind-blanking) and vigilance level (i.e., alertness). Mind-wandering and mind-blanking reports increased in frequency with time-on-task, but were associated with distinct behavioural profiles. Mind-blanking was further characterised by more profound decreases in heart-rate and pupil size than mind-wandering, and late modulation of the heartbeat-evoked potential. Besides attentional state, lower heart-rate predicted decreased vigilance and pupil size, while heart-rate variability predicted more impulsive behaviour and pupil dilation. Together, these findings reveal that cardiac parameters afford complementary information about arousal states and attentional dynamics, illustrating the complexity of task disengagement from a cognitive and physiological perspective.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Here, we combine both approaches into a two-week workflow, where ultra-high throughput screening of a library of imine reductases (IREDs) in microfluidic devices provides not only selected  hits, but also long-read sequence data linked to fitness scores of >17 thousand enzyme variants.

Interpreted by easy-to-use regression and tree-based ML algorithms designed to suit the evaluation of random whole-gene mutagenesis data, 3-fold improved  hits obtained from experimental screening are extrapolated further to give up to 23-fold improvements in catalytic rate after testing only a handful of designed mutants.

However, unlike the interactions between chromatin segments, the strength of chromatin-lamina interactions and their dependence on cellular environment are not well understood. Here, we develop a theory to predict the size and shape of peripheral heterochromatin domains by considering the energetics of chromatin-chromatin interactions, the affinity between chromatin and the nuclear lamina and the kinetics of methylation and acetylation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Through the analysis of super-resolution images of peripheral heterochromatin domains using this theoretical framework, we determine the nuclear lamina-wide distribution of chromatin-lamina affinities. We find that the extracted affinity is highly spatially heterogeneous and shows a bimodal distribution, indicating regions along the lamina with strong chromatin binding and those exhibiting vanishing chromatin affinity interspersed with some regions exhibiting a relatively diminished chromatin interactions, in line with the presence of structures such as nuclear pores. Exploring the role of environmental cues on peripheral chromatin, we find that LAD thickness increases when hMSCs are cultured on a softer substrate, in correlation with contractility-dependent translocation of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) from the cytosol to the nucleus. In soft microenvironments, chromatin becomes sequestered at the nuclear lamina, likely due to the interactions of HDAC3 with the chromatin anchoring protein LAP2 beta increasing chromatin-lamina affinity, as well as elevated levels of the intranuclear histone methylation. Our findings are further corroborated by pharmacological interventions that inhibit contractility, as well as by manipulating methylation levels using epigenetic drugs. Notably, in the context of tendinosis, a chronic condition characterized by collagen degeneration, we observed a similar increase in the thickness of peripheral chromatin akin to that of cells cultured on soft substrates consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of the microenvironment in shaping genome organization and highlight its relevance in pathological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Here we present STHD, a novel machine learning method for probabilistic cell typing of single spots in whole-transcriptome, high-resolution ST data. Unlike current binning-aggregation-deconvolution strategy, STHD directly models gene expression at single-spot level to infer cell type identities. It addresses sparsity by modeling count statistics, incorporating neighbor similarities, and leveraging reference single-cell RNA-seq data. We demonstrated that STHD accurately predicts cell type identities at single-spot level, which automatically achieved precise segmentation of global tissue architecture and local multicellular neighborhoods. The STHD labels facilitated various downstream analyses, including cell type-stratified bin aggregation, spatial compositional comparison, and cell type-specific differential expression analyses. These high-resolution labels further defined frontlines of inter-cell type interactions, revealing direct cell-cell communication activities at immune hubs of a colon cancer sample.

For efficient translation, the Pink1 mRNA needs to relocate to ribosomes located near endolysosomes and the ER. The ER membrane-tethered chaperone DNAJB6 then shields the PINK1 precursor on transit to mitochondria following the ER-SURF pathway. Loss of DNAJB6 hence leads to persistence of ER/endolysosome-associated PINK1 precursor stores and failure of mitophagy upon mitochondrial damage.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

P-TEFb, comprising cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)9 and cyclin T1, is a key transcription elongation kinase, which also regulates co-transcriptional splicing and mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. Chemical inhibition of SF3B1, a component of the splicing factor U2 snRNP, decreases P-TEFb recruitment to chromatin and mirrors the effect of P-TEFb inhibition on transcription. However, the mechanism of this effect of SF3B1 inhibitors was unclear. Here we show that SF3B1 inhibition causes rapid nuclear export of P-TEFb and loss of SF3B1 phosphorylation. SF3B1 is in complex with P-TEFb on chromatin with the elongation/splicing factor HTATSF1 and the splicing factor SNW1. SF3B1 inhibition causes the nuclear export of SNW1, but not of HTATSF1. The chromatin association of AFF4, an interaction partner of P-TEFb, is also affected by SF3B1 inhibition. Surprisingly, SF3B1 inhibition promotes degradation of SRSF2, a splicing factor known to help recruit P-TEFb to chromatin. Our results indicate that SF3B1 inhibition affects P-TEFb recruitment to genes via multiple pathways. Together, these interactions ensure efficient coupling of transcription and splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Stratifying depression by underlying biological causes may allow for more effective, targeted treatments. Immune-mediated inflammation is present in around 20% of individuals with depression and provides a potential mechanistic pathway for some key symptoms such as reward / hedonic impairment. Here we used a non-invasive model of neuroinflammation, topical application of Aldara (a TLR7/8 agonist) for 3 days in mice, to explore relationships between the intracerebral immune response, neural circuitry and behaviours closely linked to depression: motivation, reward and anxiety. Mice that were treated with Aldara exhibited anhedonia-like behaviour and impairments in intrinsic motivational behaviours (measured through assays such as sucrose preference and nest-building tests) relative to untreated controls, but displayed little anxiety-like behaviour. Aldara-driven neuroinflammation was associated with evidence of immune cell (including lymphoid and myeloid cells) ingression into the brain, and both microglia and astrocytes showed evidence of activation. Within 4 to 6 hours of Aldara treatment, neurons in midline thalamus showed strongly increased Fos immunoreactivity relative to controls. Optogenetic activation of midline thalamic projections onto ventral striatum medium spiny neurons (MSNs) revealed that Aldara treatment substantially reduced the magnitude of the evoked thalamic AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC, but with no change to the AMPA/NMDA ratio nor change in the frequency of amplitude of spontaneous EPSP. Finally, whole brain transcriptome overrepresentation analysis revealed that Aldara treatment led to significant upregulation of genes associated with immune response and downregulation of genes associated with glutamate metabolism and synaptic transmission. Altogether, our data suggest potential, testable mechanisms through which neuroinflammation can drive anhedonic-like behaviour through activation of resident neural cells, infiltrating activated immune cells and functional changes in thalamostriatal circuitry consistent with increased extrasynaptic glutamate.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Intracellular growth requires the function of the Icm/Dot type-IVb secretion system, which translocates more than 300 proteins into host cells. A screen was performed to identify L. pneumophila proteins that stimulate MAPK activation, using Icm/Dot translocated proteins ectopically expressed in mammalian cells. In parallel, a second screen was performed to identify L. pneumophila proteins expressed in yeast that cause growth inhibition in MAPK pathway-stimulatory high osmolarity medium. LegA7 was shared in both screens, a protein predicted to be a member of the bacterial cysteine protease family that has five carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeats. Three conserved residues in the predicted catalytic triad of LegA7 were mutated. These mutations abolished the ability of LegA7 to inhibit yeast growth. To identify other residues important for LegA7 function, a generalizable selection strategy in yeast was devised to isolate mutants that have lost function and no longer cause growth inhibition on high osmolarity medium. Mutations were isolated in the two carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeats, as well as an inter-domain region located between the cysteine protease domain and the ankyrin repeats. These mutations were predicted by AlphaFold modeling to localize to the face opposite from the catalytic site, arguing that they interfere with the positive regulation of the catalytic activity. Based on our data, we present a model in which LegA7 harbors a cysteine protease domain with an inter-domain and two carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeat regions that modulate the function of the catalytic domain.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

The lack of paired sequencing experiments severely restricts the analysis of microRNA-gene regulatory networks. We therefore explored whether protein-coding gene expression can be quantified from transcript fragments present in sRNAseq experiments. We first considered studies containing matched total RNA and small RNA from four human tissues and recovered transcript fragments from the small RNA experiments. We found that the expression levels of protein-coding gene transcripts from sRNAseq datasets was comparable to those from total RNAseq experiments (R2 ranging 0.33-0.76). We then analysed the expression of both microRNAs and coding genes from the same sRNAseq experiments and demonstrated that known microRNA-target interactions are, as expected, inversely correlated with the expression profiles of these microRNA-mRNA pairs. To confirm the utility of this approach, we applied our method to investigate microRNAs and their targets in breast cancer patient samples for which only sRNAseq was performed and only microRNAs studied. We again identified a clear inverse correlation between the expression of microRNAs and mRNAs that they are predicted to regulate (i.e. presence of a target site). We also found that upregulation of mir-429 is associated with the downregulation of QKI, an RNA-binding protein, in breast cancer samples. In conclusion, although the analysis of mRNA fragments to study gene expression from sRNAseq experiments may have its limitations, it can be very informative in the study of microRNA-mRNA interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Here we address three long-standing questions concerning senescence. First, we show that the ATM kinase is solely responsible for the induction of replicative senescence. Senescence was delayed by ATM inhibition (ATMi) or overexpression of TRF2, the shelterin subunit dedicated to ATM repression. In contrast, there was no evidence for ATR signaling contributing to replicative senescence even when ATMi was combined with ATR inhibition. Second, we show ATMi can induce apparently normal cell divisions in a subset of senescent cells, indicating that senescence can be reversed. Third, we show that the extended replicative life span at low (physiological) oxygen is due to diminished ATM activity. At low oxygen, cells show a decreased ATM response to dysfunctional telomeres and genome-wide DSBs compared to 20% oxygen. As this effect could be reversed by NAC, the attenuated response of ATM to critically short telomeres and the resulting extended life span at low oxygen is likely due to ROS-induced formation of cysteine disulfide-bridges that crosslink ATM dimers into a form that is not activated by DSBs. These findings show how primary human cells detect shortened telomeres and reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the telomere tumor suppressor pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Changes in the rate of blood flow manifest in altered shear stress, which activates signaling cascades that drive vascular remodeling. Consistently, dysregulation of the endothelial response to fluid shear forces and aberrant flow patterns both lead to pathological conditions, including impaired blood vessel development and atherosclerosis. Despite its importance, the mechanisms driving the coordinated cell behavior underlying vascular remodeling are not fully understood. Combining classical cell biological approaches with advanced image analysis, mathematical modeling, biomimetic strategies, and in vivo studies, we identify the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Vangl1 as an enforcer of flow-dependent cell dynamics in the vascular system. We demonstrate that shear stress triggers the relocation of Vangl1 from an internal reservoir to the plasma membrane at the initiation of cell remodeling. Membrane enrichment of Vangl1 is mediated by a Coronin1C-dependent shift in the equilibrium between endo- and exocytosis and results in the spatial reorganization of another essential PCP protein, Frizzled6 (Fzd6). The resulting mutual exclusion of the core PCP proteins Fzd6 and Vangl1 augments differential junctional and cytoskeletal dynamics along the flow axis. Loss of Vangl1 limits the ability of endothelial cells to respond to shear forces in a coordinated fashion, resulting in irregular cell alignment along the flow direction and erroneous vessel sprouting. Together, these studies introduce core PCP signaling as a determinant of collective cell dynamics and organization of the vascular system.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

However, limited microscopic understanding of it exists, particularly for anatomical asymmetry where there are few well-established animal models. In humans, most of the brain shows subtle, population-average, regional asymmetries in cortical thickness or surface area. In addition, a macro-scale twisting called the cerebral petalia exists in which the right hemisphere protrudes anteriorly relative to the left. Here, we ask whether neuroanatomical asymmetries can be observed in mice, leveraging 6 different neuroimaging cohorts of animals from 5 different research groups (~3,500 animals in total). We found an anterior-posterior pattern of volume asymmetry in mice, where anterior regions are larger on the right while posterior regions are larger on the left. This pattern appears driven by a similar trend in surface area asymmetry and is supported by a concordant pattern of positional asymmetries. The cerebral hemisphere as a whole appears shifted anteriorly on the right while the brainstem and cerebellum appear shifted anteriorly on the left. These results together indicate a small torsion of the brain is present in mice, similar to the cerebral petalia in humans. By establishing a signature of anatomical brain asymmetry in mice, we aim to provide a foundation for future studies to probe the mechanistic underpinnings of anatomical brain asymmetry seen in humans - a feature of the brain with extremely limited understanding.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

We show that intercalation after cell division generates important movements of epiblast cells which lead to their relocation to different presumptive territories, explaining this broad spectrum of fates. This tissue remodeling phase is transient, being soon followed by the establishment of boundaries restricting cell movements therefore defining the presumptive territories of the epiblast.

Here, we have developed stem cell-derived organoids resembling human floor plate (hFpO) and assembled them with spinal cord organoids (hSpO) to generate midline assembloids (hMA).

These adaptive growth responses depend on a rapid transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational reprogramming. It is unclear, however, how temperature information is sensed and integrated with the cellular splicing machinery to establish warm-temperature dependent splicing patterns. In animals, CDC2-LIKE KINASES (CLKs) function as body temperature sensors that control temperature-dependent alternative splicing through the phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the CLK-homologous ARABIDOPSIS FUS3-COMPLEMENTING (AFC) kinases function as temperature sensors that regulate post-transcriptional RNA processing to control warm temperature-dependent growth responses in Arabidopsis. We show that the contrasting temperature-activity profiles of the three Arabidopsis AFCs depend on specific structural elements including a conserved activation segment within the kinase domain. By combining protein structure prediction with site-directed mutagenesis, we provide insights into structural features that determine different temperature-activity profiles of the three AFC paralogs. Subsequent analyses of afc mutant plants demonstrate their requirement for hypocotyl elongation growth and thermonastic leaf movement at elevated temperature. Impaired hypocotyl elongation of afc triple mutant seedlings was accompanied by defects in temperature-dependent splicing especially affecting the post-transcriptional regulation of transcripts encoding splicing factors. Finally, based on transcriptomics, immunodetection and mutant analyses our data indicate SR34 and SR34a as phosphorylation targets that mediate temperature-dependent post-transcriptional RNA processing downstream of AFCs.

Recent advancements in proteomic techniques revealed the presence of acetylation in thousands of non-histone proteins. Here, we conducted extensive meta-analysis of 48 acetylomes spanning diverse organisms, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worms, plants, insects, crustacea, fish, and mammals. Our analyzes revealed a predominance of a single acetylation site in a protein detected in all studied organisms, and proteins heavily acetylated, with >5-10 acetylated-sites, were represented by Hsp70, histone or transcription GTP-biding domain. Moreover, using gene enrichment approaches we found that ATP metabolic processes, glycolysis, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pathways and oxidative stress response are among the most acetylated cellular processes. Finally, to better explore the regulatory function of acetylation in glycolysis and oxidative stress we used aldolase and superoxide dismutase A (SODA) enzymes as model. For aldolase, we found that K147 acetylation, responsible to regulate human enzyme, conserved in all phylogenic clade, suggesting that this acetylation might play the same role in other species; while for SODA, we identified many lysine residues in different species present in the tunnel region, which was demonstrated for human and Trypanosoma cruzi, as negative regulator, also suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the conservation and functional significance of lysine acetylation in different organisms emphasizing its roles in cellular processes, metabolic pathways, and molecular regulation, shedding light in the extensive function of non-histone lysine acetylation.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

While Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is used extensively in research and biotechnology, it is a unicellular organism capable of only limited multicellular states. Here we expand the possibilities for engineering multicellular behaviours in yeast by developing modular toolkits for two key mechanisms seen in multicellularity, contact-dependent signalling and specific cell-to-cell adhesion. MARS (Mating-peptide Anchored Response System) is a toolkit based on surface-displayed fungal mating peptides and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling which can mimic juxtacrine signalling between yeasts. SATURN (Saccharomyces Adhesion Toolkit for multicellUlar patteRNing) surface displays adhesion-proteins pairs on yeasts and facilitates the creation of cell aggregation patterns. Together they can be used to create multicellular logic circuits, equivalent to developmental programs that lead to cell differentiation based on the local population. Using MARS and SATURN, we further developed JUPITER (JUxtacrine sensor for Protein-protein InTERaction), a genetic sensor for assaying protein-protein interactions in culture, demonstrating this as a tool to select for high affinity binders among a population of mutated nanobodies. Collectively, MARS, SATURN, and JUPITER present valuable tools that facilitate the engineering of complex multicellularity with yeast and expand the scope of its biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Effective antimicrobial therapy reduces complications and mortality; however, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major problem in many endemic countries. Prevention through vaccination is possible through recently-licensed Gavi-supported typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs), and national immunisation programs are currently being considered or deployed in several countries where AMR prevalence is known to be high. Pathogen whole genome sequence data are a rich source of information on Typhi variants (genotypes or lineages), AMR prevalence, and mechanisms. However, this information is currently not readily accessible to non-genomics experts, including those driving vaccine implementation or empirical therapy guidance.

ResultsWe developed TyphiNET (https://www.typhi.net), an interactive online dashboard for exploring Typhi genotype and AMR distributions derived from publicly available pathogen genome sequences. TyphiNET allows users to explore country-level summaries such as the frequency of pathogen lineages, temporal trends in resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials, and the specific variants and mechanisms underlying emergent AMR trends. User-driven plots and session reports can be downloaded for ease of sharing. Importantly, TyphiNET is populated by high-quality genome data curated by the Global Typhoid Pathogen Genomics Consortium, analysed using the Pathogenwatch platform, and identified as coming from non-targeted sampling frames that are suitable for estimating AMR prevalence amongst Typhi infections (no personal data is included in the platform). As of February 2024, data from a total of n=11,836 genomes from 101 countries are available in TyphiNET. We outline case studies illustrating how the dashboard can be used to explore these data and gain insights of relevance to both researchers and public health policy-makers.

ConclusionsThe TyphiNET dashboard provides an interactive platform for accessing genome-derived data on pathogen variant frequencies to inform typhoid control and intervention strategies. The platform is extensible in terms of both data and features, and provides a model for making complex bacterial genome-derived data accessible to a wide audience.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

We introduce TarDis, a novel deep generative model designed to disentangle intricate covariate structures across diverse biological datasets, distinguishing technical artifacts from true biological variations. By employing tailored covariate-specific loss components and a self-supervised approach, TarDis effectively generates multiple latent space representations that capture each continuous and categorical target covariate separately, along with unexplained variation. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TarDis outperforms existing methods in data integration, covariate disentanglement, and robust out-of-distribution predictions. The models capacity to produce interpretable and structured latent spaces, including ordered latent representations for continuous covariates, enhances its utility in hypothesis-driven research. Consequently, TarDis offers a promising analytical platform for advancing scientific discovery, providing insights into cellular dynamics, and enabling targeted therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

Here, we analyze data for 27 traits, including anthropometric traits, metabolic traits, and binary diseases--both early-onset and post-reproductive. We develop an inference framework to test existing population genetics models based on the joint distribution of allelic effect sizes and frequencies of trait-associated variants. A majority of traits have GWAS results that are inconsistent with neutral evolution or long-term directional selection (selection against a trait or against disease risk). Instead, we find that most traits show consistency with stabilizing selection, which acts to preserve an intermediate trait value or disease risk. Our observations also suggest that selection may reflect pleiotropy, with each variant influenced by associations with multiple selected traits.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

However, evidence for a dominant female role in these societies has been scarce. We studied social organisation, mobility patterns and gendered practices in Neolithic Southwest Asia using 131 paleogenomes from Catalhoyuk East Mound (7100-5950 BCE), a major settlement in Central Anatolia with an uninterrupted occupation and an apparent egalitarian structure. In contrast to widespread genetic evidence for patrilocality in Neolithic Europe, the Catalhoyuk individuals revealed no indication of patrilocal mobility. Analysing genetic kin ties among individuals buried in the same house (co-burials) across 35 Catalhoyuk buildings, we identified close ties concentrated within buildings and among neighbours in Catalhoyuks Early period, akin to those in the preceding Pre-Pottery Neolithic in Southwest Asia. This pattern weakened over time: by the late 7th millennium BCE, subadults buried in the same building were rarely closely genetically related, despite sharing similar diets. Still, throughout the sites occupation, genetic connections within Catalhoyuk buildings were much more frequently connected via the maternal than the paternal line. We also identified differential funerary treatment of female subadults compared to those of males, with a higher frequency of grave goods associated with females. Our results reveal how kinship practices changed while key female roles persisted over one thousand years in a large Neolithic community in western Eurasia.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

These events constitute a nationwide trauma with major ramifications for public mental health. This article presents an evidence-based model for the prediction of the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to the terrorist attack and the war.

Main bodyThe creation of the model consisted of several steps. Firstly, the Israeli population was divided into six groups based on the intensity, context, and type of traumatic exposure (direct exposure to terror, close proximity to terror, soldiers in combat and support units, intense exposure to rocket attacks, moderate exposure to rocket attacks, and indirectly affected communities), and the population size of each group was assessed using official national databases. Secondly, an estimation of the expected prevalence of PTSD in each of the exposure groups was based on a review of the relevant literature. A random-effects meta-analysis of the prevalence rates was conducted separately per each exposure group. Finally, the predicted number of PTSD causalities in the population was calculated by multiplying the group size and the PTSD prevalence estimation. Based on population size and estimated PTSD prevalence within each exposure category, the model predicts that approximately 5.3% (N=519,923) of the Israeli population (95% prediction interval, 160,346-879,502), may develop PTSD as a result of the terrorist attack and the war.

ConclusionsThe predicted number of individuals with PTSD following mass trauma is expected to be considerable. The presented model can assist policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in preparing and devising adequate interventions for the mental health needs of large populations. Moreover, this model can be applied in other instances of mass-trauma exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1719526084014

Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans.

These communication patterns can be comprehensively mapped using noninvasive functional imaging, resulting in functional connectivity (FC) networks. Despite its popularity, FC is a statistical construct and its operational definition is arbitrary. While most studies use zero-lag Pearsons correlations by default, there exist hundreds of pairwise interaction statistics in the broader scientific literature that can be used to estimate FC. How the organization of the FC matrix varies with the choice of pairwise statistic is a fundamental methodological question that affects all studies in this rapidly growing field. Here we comprehensively benchmark the topological and geometric organization, neurobiological associations, and cognitive-behavioral relevance of FC matrices computed using a large library of 239 pairwise interaction statistics. We comprehensively investigate how canonical features of FC networks vary with the choice of pairwise statistic, including (1) hub mapping, (2) weight-distance trade-offs, (3) structure-function coupling, (4) correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, (5) individual fingerprinting, and (6) brain-behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Throughout, we observe that measures such as covariance (full correlation), precision (partial correlation) and distance display multiple desirable properties, including close correspondence with structural connectivity, the capacity to differentiate individuals and to predict individual differences in behavior. Using information flow decomposition, we find that differences among FC methods may arise from differential sensitivity to the underlying mechanisms of inter-regional communication, with some more sensitive to redundant and some to synergistic information flow. In summary, our report highlights the importance of tailoring a pairwise statistic to a specific neurophysiological mechanism and research question, providing a blueprint for future studies to optimize their choice of FC method.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

We use computational protein design to create de novo 5{beta}1-specific modulating miniprotein binders, called NeoNectins, that bind to and stabilize the open state of 5{beta}1. When immobilized onto titanium surfaces and throughout 3D hydrogels, the NeoNectins outperform native fibronectin and RGD peptide in enhancing cell attachment and spreading, and NeoNectin-coated titanium implants outperformed fibronectin and RGD-coated implants in animal models in promoting tissue integration and bone growth. NeoNectins should be broadly applicable for tissue engineering and biomedicine.

Episodic memory enables us to remember events from the past whereas spatial memory enables us to form a map-like representation of the environment. Interestingly, these seemingly different functions rely on the same brain structure: the hippocampus. Yet, how the hippocampus supports both at the same time remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypotheses that the hippocampus supports these two systems either via a common coding mechanism or via a parallel processing mechanism. To this end, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an episodic life-simulation task and a spatial virtual reality task to manipulate episodic and spatial context associations of objects. We then investigated fMRI adaptation effects between these objects as a result of shared contexts. We found that the fMRI signal in the anterior hippocampus scaled with the combined prediction of shared episodic and spatial contexts, in line with the idea of a common coding mechanism. We found no evidence for a parallel processing mechanism, as there were no differences between episodic and spatial effects. The common coding effect for episodic and spatial memory dovetails with the broader notion of domain-general hippocampal cognitive maps.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

In Ghana, no published studies have been conducted to evaluate the quality of COVID-19 data submitted onto the national web-based platform, District Health Information Management System version 2 (DHIMS-2) during the COVID-19 period. In this regard, this study seeks to assess the estimates and determinants of COVID-19 data quality in the DHIMS-2 in the Ahafo region of Ghana.

MethodsA facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed, with a desk review of COVID-19 records in DHIMS-2 and primary data sources (registers and monthly reporting forms). This study involved all 23 different levels of healthcare facilities that reported on COVID-19 in the Ahafo region from March 2020 to December 2022. We assessed COVID-19 data quality using three dimensions of completeness, accuracy, and timeliness according to the World Health Organization data quality guide. Mixed-effect logistic regression was then employed to identify the determinants of COVID-19 data quality at a 95% confidence interval.

ResultsThe overall COVID-19 data quality was estimated at 35.9% (95%CI=32.6%, 39.4%) while the rate of the data dimensions of timeliness, completeness, and accuracy were 50.2% (95%CI=46.7%, 53.8%), 50.6% (95%CI=47.1%, 54.2%), and 72.4% (95%CI=69.1%, 75.5%) respectively. It was found that the availability of a functional data validation team at the health facilities (AOR=18.3; 95%CI=1.62, 20.7; p= 0.019), training of data managers in COVID-19 data management (AOR=9.37; 95%CI=2.56, 34.3; p=0.001), and data managers with two-year professional training (certificate background) (AOR=3.42; 95%CI=1.95, 12.2; p=0.025) were independently associated with COVID-19 data quality.

ConclusionThe overall COVID-19 data quality in the Ahafo region was quite poor. Dimensionally, while the rate of data timeliness was high, that of data completeness, and accuracy were relatively low. The interaction of the independent correlates of COVID-19 data quality requires the healthcare system to identify stringent measures to strengthen the health information system to enhance planning and decision-making, especially during disease outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1719526084014

Previous research has uncovered symbiosis tradeoffs, including suppression of the NF-{kappa}B immune pathway in cnidarians hosting intracellular algae and correlations between symbiotic state and pathogen susceptibility. Here, we used a multiomic approach to characterize symbiotic states of the facultatively symbiotic coral Oculina arbuscula by generating genotype-controlled fragments of symbiotic and aposymbiotic tissue. Metabarcoding of 16S rRNA showed no difference in bacterial communities between symbiotic states. Consistent with previous whole-organism RNA-seq studies, whole-organism proteomics revealed differential abundance of proteins related to immunity, consistent with immune suppression during symbiosis. Moreover, single-cell RNAseq identified diverse cell clusters within six cell types across symbiotic states. Specifically, the gastrodermal cell cluster containing algal-hosting cells from symbiotic tissue had higher expression of nitrogen cycling and sugar transport genes than gastrodermal cells from aposymbiotic tissue. Furthermore, lower expression of genes involved in immune regulation, including NF-{kappa}B pathway genes, was observed in these gastrodermal cells from symbiotic tissue. However, no differences in gene expression in the immune cell cluster were observed between symbiotic states. This work reveals a compartmentalization of immune system suppression in specific gastrodermal cells in symbiosis, which likely limits symbiosis tradeoffs by dampening immunity in algal hosting cells while still maintaining general organismal immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719526084014

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719526084014

However, to be included in national NCS inventories, governments must first quantify the kelp-derived carbon stocks and fluxes leading to carbon sequestration. Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1719526084014

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1719526084014
