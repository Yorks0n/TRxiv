Here we explored the provocative hypothesis that parents sensation or perception of environmental cues can influence their offspring, extending across many subsequent generations. We show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, temperature perception on its own can induce transgenerational changes in RNAi factors, small RNAs, and the genes that they regulate. Moreover, we identified secreted factors that enable a pair of thermosensory neurons (AFD) to communicate with the germline and trace the path of the epigenetic signal. We further modeled the process mathematically and validated the new predictions generated by the model experimentally. Hence, our results demonstrate that sensory perception is sufficient to trigger small RNA-mediated heritable gene expression memory.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544298

Such transgenerational inheritance is reversable as it does not lead to mutations and thus alterations in the genetic information. Epigenetic mechanisms such as small RNAs (sRNAs) in the germline silence transposable elements (TEs), which comprise a significant portion of the genome. TE mobility can be mutagenic and is thought to contribute to genome evolution by altering genome structure and diversification. In C. elegans elevated temperature leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline, suggesting that environmental conditions could impact the integrity of inheritable genomes. Here, we show that dysfunction of the AFD thermosensory neurons leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline. The TE activity results in de novo insertions and mutagenesis. Our data indicate that neuronal sensing of environmental conditions can alter genetic inheritance through stress-induced TE mutagenesis thus shaping genome evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544298

We present ProDomino, a novel machine learning pipeline to rationalize domain recombination, trained on a semi-synthetic protein sequence dataset derived from naturally occurring intradomain insertion events. ProDomino robustly identifies domain insertion sites in proteins of biotechnological relevance, which we experimentally validated in E. coli and human cells. Finally, we employed light- and chemically regulated receptor domains as inserts and demonstrate the rapid, model-guided creation of potent, single-component opto- and chemogenetic protein switches.

The relative importance of standing genetic variation vs. de novo mutations in adaptation remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Selection during domestication has been long used as a model to understand evolutionary processes, providing information not only on the phenotypes selected but also, in many cases, an understanding of the causal loci. Of the multiple causal loci that have been identified in maize, the selected allele can be found segregating in natural populations, consistent with their origin as standing genetic variation. The sole exception to this pattern is the well-characterized domestication locus tga1, which has long been thought to be an example of selection on a de novo mutation. Here, we use a large dataset of maize and teosinte genomes to reconstruct the origin and evolutionary history of tga1. We first estimated the age of tga1-maize using a genealogy-based method, finding that the allele arose approximately 41,000-49,000 years ago, predating the beginning of maize domestication. We also identify, for the first time, tga1-maize in teosinte populations, indicating the allele can survive in the wild. Finally, we compare observed patterns of haplotype structure and mutational age distributions near tga1 with simulations, finding that patterns near tga1 in maize better resemble those generated under simulated selective sweeps on standing variation. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that maize domestication likely drew upon standing genetic variation at tga1 and cement the importance of standing variation in driving adaptation during domestication.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544298

This escape has been attributed to mutations in critical neutralizing antibody epitopes mainly in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. Here we show that this notion is incomplete. We found that several broadly neutralizing human antibodies isolated over the past years retain an almost undiminished capacity for inhibitory targeting of RBDs of recent highly immunoevasive SARS-CoV-2 strains. Likewise, human sera collected during the pre-Omicron era from persons immunized with original Wuhan-based vaccines were found to contain abundant neutralizing activity targeted against the RBDs of modern Omicron variants. However, this unexpected neutralization sensitivity was observed only when these RBDs were incorporated into a mismatched spike protein backbone, whereas the corresponding native Omicron spike proteins were highly resistant against the same panel of antibodies and human sera. We conclude that changes occurring outside of the RBD and leading to altered conformational dynamics of the spike protein have played a key part in the viral evolution enabling SARS-CoV-2 to escape from neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved cryptic RBD epitopes.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544298

We present LRGE, a novel tool that uses read-to-read overlap information to estimate genome size in a reference-free manner. LRGE calculates per-read genome size estimates by analysing the expected number of overlaps for each read, considering read lengths and a minimum overlap threshold. The final size is taken as the median of these estimates, ensuring robustness to outliers such as reads with no overlaps. Additionally, LRGE provides an expected confidence range for the estimate. LRGE outperforms k-mer-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency and produces genome size estimates comparable to those from assembly-based approaches, like Raven, while using significantly less computational resources. We validate LRGE on a large, diverse bacterial dataset and confirm it generalises to eukaryotic datasets.

Availability and implementationOur method, LRGE (Long Read-based Genome size Estimation from overlaps), is implemented in Rust and is available as a precompiled binary for most architectures, a Bioconda package, a prebuilt container image, and a crates.io package as a binary (lrge) or library (liblrge).

Recently, a wealth of public single-cell RNA sequencing data as well as rapid scaling of self-supervised learning methods have provided new avenues to address this longstanding challenge. However, rapid parameter scaling has been essential to the success of large language models in text and images, while similar scaling has not been attempted with Transformer architectures for cellular modeling. To produce accurate, transferable, and biologically meaningful representations of cellular systems, we develop AIDO.Cell, a pretrained module for representing gene expression and cellular systems in an AI-driven Digital Organism [1]. AIDO.Cell contains a series of 3M, 10M, 100M, and 650M parameter encoder-only dense Transformer models pre-trained on 50 million human cells from diverse tissues using a read-depth-aware masked gene expression pretraining objective. Unlike previous models, AIDO.Cell is capable of handling the entire human transcriptome as input without truncation or sampling tricks, thus learning accurate and general representations of the human cells entire transcriptional context. This pretraining with a longer context was enabled through FlashAttention-2, mixed precision, and large-scale distributed systems training. AIDO.Cell (100M) achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks such as zero-shot clustering, cell-type classification, and perturbation modeling. Our findings reveal interesting loss scaling behaviors as we increase AIDO.Cells parameters from 3M to 650M, providing insights for future directions in single-cell modeling.

It is commonly assumed that cells respond to these gradients by migrating directionally towards the regions of highest ligand density. In contrast with this view, here we show that cells exposed to micropatterned fibronectin gradients exhibit a complex repertoire of trajectories, including directed haptotactic migration up the gradient but also linear oscillations and circles with extended periods of migration down the gradient. To explain this behavior, we developed a biophysical model of haptotactic cell migration based on a coarse-grained molecular clutch model coupled to persistent stochastic polarity dynamics. While initial haptotactic migration is explained by the differential friction at the front and back of the cell, the observed complex trajectories over longer time scales arise from the interplay between differential friction, persistence, and physical confinement. Overall, our study reveals that confinement and persistence modulate the ability of cells to sense and respond to haptotactic cues and provides a framework to understand how cells navigate complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544298

However, these co-expression networks must be interpreted with caution, as they can arise from multiple processes. Here, we show that hybridization and gene flow between populations can greatly modify co-expression networks. Admixture between populations produces correlated expression between genes experiencing linkage disequilibrium. This correlated expression does not reflect functional relationships between genes, but rather depends on migration rates and physical linkage on chromosomes. Given the prevalence of gene flow between divergent populations in nature, these introgression effects likely represent a significant force in network evolution, even in populations where hybridization is historical rather than contemporary. These findings emphasize the critical importance of considering both evolutionary history and genomic architecture when analyzing gene co-expression networks in natural populations.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transition through a series of intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation. These transitions are usually framed in terms of a mechanism where agonist binding and channel activation are separate events. Here, we collect cryo-EM images over a range of agonist concentrations to define structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. We show that agonist binding to a single agonist site stabilizes an intermediate state where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit has transitioned to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Binding of agonist to the second agonist site fully activates the remaining subunits leading to hydration of the ion pore. Uniting this cryo-EM derived intermediate structure with single-channel recordings leads to a model where individual acetylcholine receptor subunits asynchronously undergo conformational transitions, and thus a sequential activation mechanism that has implications for the entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

They are an important tool for understanding both the spread of epidemics as well as long-term macroevolutionary trends in speciation and extinction. In particular, phylodynamic methods based on multi-type birth-death models have been used to infer the evolution of discrete traits, the movement of individuals or pathogens between geographic locations or host types, and the transition of infected individuals between disease stages. In these models, population heterogeneity is treated by assigning individuals to different discrete types. Typically, methods which allow inference of parameters under multi-type birth-death models integrate over the possible birth-death trajectories (i.e. the type-specific population size functions) to reduce the computational demands of the inference. As a result, it has not been possible to use these methods to directly infer the dynamics of trait-specific population sizes, infected host counts or other such demographic quantities. In this paper we present a method which infers these multi-type trajectories with almost no additional computational cost beyond that of existing methods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by applying it to a previously-published set of MERS-CoV genomes, inferring the numbers of human and camel cases through time, together with the number and timing of spillovers from the camel reservoir. This application highlights the multi-type population trajectorys ability to elucidate properties of the population which are not directly ancestral to its sampled members.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Not only do TF concentrations fluctuate in time and from cell to cell, in each cell the actual binding and unbinding of TFs to promoters is also stochastic. However, how this  noise propagation from TFs to their targets determines the expression fluctuations in target genes of the same TF has so far not been quantitatively characterized. Here we use fluorescence time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics and automated image analysis to quantitatively track the single-cell growth and gene expression dynamics of different target promoters of the LexA SOS response regulator in E. coli under mild DNA damage induced by the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP).

We find that, at the single-cell level, LexA target promoters exhibit stochastic bursts in protein production with specific quantitative characteristics. First, the durations of protein production bursts are short, identical for all promoters, and independent of CIP levels. Second, the heights of the production peaks are exponentially distributed for each promoter, and independent of CIP level, but with different average heights for different promoters. Third, the frequency of the production bursts increases with CIP level for all promoters, but differs across promoters.

Importantly, we show that these observations are inconsistent with popular  equilibrium models of bacterial gene regulation that assume that the dynamics of binding and unbinding of TFs is fast relative to the time-scale of TF concentration fluctuations. Instead, all observations can be quantitatively fit by a relatively simple model in which DNA damage events lead to short transient dips in LexA concentration, and an expression burst occurs in a cell whenever LexA unbinds from the target promoter during such a short dip in LexA concentration. Moreover, because these transient dips in LexA concentration occur on the same time-scale as the stochastic unbinding of LexA from promoters, the response of a target promoter to an individual DNA damage event is stochastic and depends in a complex manner on the strengths of its LexA binding sites and the duration of the event. Consequently, the expression levels of different LexA target genes in a given cell reflect distinct statistics of the frequency and durations of DNA damage events in the recent history of that cell.

Our results show that, even in the simple scenario where a single TF is induced, different target promoters can exhibit distinct stochastic responses that depend on the precise kinetics of the induction events.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

While emerging research demonstrates that isolates belonging to the P. syringae species complex colonize diverse hosts, the extent to which these bacteria naturally infect non-flowering plants like the model liverwort Marchantia polymorpha remains unclear. Here, we identify natural associations between Pseudomonas viridiflava and the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. Pseudomonas bacteria isolated from diseased liverworts in the wild successfully re-infected M. polymorpha in pure culture conditions, producing high in planta bacterial densities and causing prominent tissue maceration. Comparative genomic analysis of Marchantia-associated P. viridiflava identified core virulence machinery like the type-III secretion system (T3SS) and conserved effectors (AvrE and HopM1) that were essential for liverwort infection. Disease assays performed in Nicotiana benthamiana further confirmed that liverwort-associated P. viridiflava infect flowering plants in an effector-dependent manner. Our work highlights P. viridiflava as an effective broad host pathogen that relies on conserved virulence factors to manipulate evolutionarily divergent host plants.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Such fibrinaloid microclots are also relatively resistant to fibrinolysis. The proteins that the amyloid microclots contained differed markedly both from the soluble proteome of typical plasma and that of normal clots, and also between the disease studies (an acute syndrome in the form of sepsis in an ITU and a chronic disease represented by Long COVID). Many proteins in the amyloid microclots were low in concentration in plasma and were effectively accumulated into the fibres, whereas many other abundant plasma proteins were excluded. The proteins found in the microclots associated with the diseases also tended to be themselves amyloidogenic. We here ask effectively the inverse question. This is: can the clot proteome tell us whether the clots associated with a particular disease contained proteins that are observed uniquely (or are highly over-represented) in known amyloid clots relative to normal clots, and thus were in fact amyloid in nature? The answer is in the affirmative in a variety of major coagulopathies, viz. venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, various cardiac issues, and ischaemic stroke. Galectin-3-binding protein and thrombospondin-1 seem to be especially widely associated with amyloid-type clots, and the latter has indeed been shown to be incorporated into growing fibrin fibres. These may consequently provide useful biomarkers with a mechanistic basis.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Force generated by beating cilia propels cells and moves fluids. The ciliary skeleton is made of peripheral doublet microtubules and a central pair (CP) with a distinct structure at the tip. In this study, we present a high-resolution structure of the CP in the ciliary tip of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and identify several tip proteins that bind and form unique patterns on both microtubules of the tip CP. Two of those proteins that contain tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP)-like domains, TLP1 and TLP2, bind to high curvature regions of the microtubule. TLP2, which contains two TPPP-like domains, is an unusually long protein that wraps laterally around half a microtubule and forms the bridge between the two microtubules. Moreover, we found that the conserved protein SPEF1 binds to both microtubule seams. In vitro, human SPEF1 not only binds to the microtubule seam but also crosslinks two parallel microtubules. Single-molecule microtubule dynamics assays indicate that SPEF1 stabilizes microtubules in vitro. Together, these data show that the proteins in the tip CP maintain stable microtubule structure and probably play important roles in maintaining the integrity of the axoneme.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Here we demonstrate that XNA-containing templates can be directly and robustly sequenced (>2.3 million reads/flowcell, similar to DNA controls) on a MinION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies to obtain signal data that is significantly distinct from DNA controls (median fold-change >6x). To enable training of machine learning models that deconvolve these signals and basecall XNAs along with natural bases, we developed a framework to synthesize a complex pool of 1,024 UB-containing oligonucleotides with diverse 6-mer sequence contexts and high XNA purity (>90% UB-insertion on average). Bootstrapped models to enable data preparation, and data augmentation with spliced XNA reads to provide high context diversity, enabled learning of a generalizable model to call natural as well as unnatural bases with high accuracy (>80%) and specificity (99%).

Besides the commonly used Agrobacterium strains, Rhizobium rhizogenes can also introduce foreign DNA into host plants for gene expression. While many R. rhizogenes strains have been known for inducing hairy root symptoms, their use for transient expression has not been fully explored. Here, we showed that R. rhizogenes A4 outperformed all other tested agrobacterial strains in agroinfiltration experiments on leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and other solanaceous plants. By conducting an agroinfiltration screening in N. benthamiana leaves using various agrobacterial strains carrying the RUBY reporter gene cassette, we discovered that A4 mediates the strongest and fastest transient expression. Utilizing the genomic information, we developed a collection of disarmed and modified strains derived from A4. By performing vacuum infiltration assays, we demonstrated that these A4-derived strains efficiently transiently transform 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves, showing less sensitivity to the age of plants compared to the laboratory strain GV3101. Furthermore, we performed agroinfiltration using AS109, an A4-derived disarmed strain, on the leaves of tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Remarkably, AS109 mediated transient gene expression on tested solanaceous plants more effectively than all the tested commonly used agrobacterial strains. This discovery paves the way for establishing R. rhizogenes A4-derived strains as a new option for enhancing transient expression in N. benthamiana and facilitating the functional study of plant genes in other solanaceous species.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

We find that {beta} cell ablation impedes PDAC development in mice, arguing that the endocrine pancreas is critical for exocrine tumorigenesis. Conversely, obesity induces {beta} cell hormone dysregulation, alters CCK-dependent peri-islet exocrine cell transcriptional states, and enhances islet proximal tumor formation.

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a neural hub encoding mood and motivation that contributes to the locomotor and mood dampening effects of neuroinflammation. Dopamine receptor 1 mediums spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) of the NAc regulate locomotor activity, motivated behavior and emotional states and are modulated by microglial reactivity. Here, we evaluated sickness- and anxiety-like behaviors along with D1-MSN activity and microglial responses in the NAc to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. LPS stimulated anxiety-like behavior, blunted locomotion and reduced cFos expression in D1-MSNs of the NAc core and shell of male mice. These effects associated with reduced excitatory inputs (EPSCs) onto D1-MSNs as measured by whole cell patch-clamp. To determine if microglia contribute to changes in MSN activity, Ca2+ imaging of primary cultures containing NAc neurons with or without primary NAc microglia was performed. The presence of microglia decreased the activity of LPS-treated MSNs in response to dopamine and glutamate application and LPS stimulated microglial phagocytosis of MSN processes in co-cultures. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that in vivo LPS treatment enhanced morphological indices of microglia reactivity and engulfment of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) inputs in the NAc. Our results suggest that LPS reduces locomotion and stimulates anxiety via increasing microglia engulfment of excitatory inputs onto D1-MSNs, and highlight changes in NAc microglia phagocytic activity in the behavioral consequences of neuroinflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

The presented study establishes a comprehensive protocol for preclinical testing of novel RUTF formulations using a validated juvenile rat model replicating key features of malnutrition in children. Beyond the standard anthropometric measurements (body weight, length, and food consumption), bone quality is assessed through micro-computed tomography and mechanical testing, providing insights into microstructure and functionality beyond standard anthropometric measurements. Concurrently, gut microbiome dynamics are analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing coupled with metabolomic profiling of stool and serum to monitor gut health and systemic recovery.By addressing critical gaps in traditional RUTF evaluations and emphasising locally sourced, cost-effective formulations, this protocol offers a transformative framework for developing accessible and impactful malnutrition treatments. The findings generated through this multidisciplinary approach will guide RUTFs optimisation, strengthen their scientific foundation, and pave the way for evidence-based clinical trials to improve global malnutrition treatment strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Current rapid rewarming methods are unreliable at maintaining water temperature between the gold standard range of 37{degrees}C and 39{degrees}C.

In-vitro rewarming trials were conducted using frozen wild boar (Sus scrofa) legs to evaluate 3 rewarming methods: sink and faucet, bucket, and immersion circulator. Porcine leg temperature and water temperature were measured every minute over the 30 minute duration of each trial. The immersion circulator method proved to be the most efficient at reaching the target tissue temperature (9 minutes) while maintaining the least variability in water temperature (0% of time spent below 37{degrees}C).

Two current issues with RTC is that it scales as O(N^2) making it inefficient at high frame counts, and the clustering results are dependent on the order of the input frames. To address the first issue, we have increased the speed of the seed selection by using k-means++ to select the seeds of the available frames.

The recombinant B3.13 viruses displayed faster replication kinetics in bovine cells compared to other IAV.

Peptides are particularly compelling therapeutic agents for targeting GPCRs, as they frequently exhibit superior affinity, selectivity, and potency compared to small molecule drugs. However, the dynamic conformational states of GPCRs profoundly influence their interactions with ligands, highlighting the need for state-specific strategies in peptide design. To address this, we developed an efficient state-specific peptide design framework targeting GPCRs. This approach includes an analysis of GPCR state-transition mechanisms and a specially optimized peptide structure prediction model for GPCRs, HelixFold-Multistate, allowing us to evaluate state-specific scores for the designed peptides. On recent GPCR-peptide PDBs, HelixFold-Multistate not only maintains the GPCR active state, similar to AlphaFold-Multistate, but also demonstrates high interaction prediction capabilities comparable to AlphaFold-Multimer in terms of DockQ and iRMS. Experiments on CXCR4-peptide affinity data indicate that its confidence scores exhibit a higher correlation and screening capability than those of AlphaFold-Multistate. By employing this design method, we successfully identified both the agonist and antagonist peptides for the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor (GHSR) and Apelin Receptor (APJ), exhibiting EC50 values below 100 nM and 10 nM respectively. Despite the challenges with antagonist peptides, our method also identified inhibitors for GHSR and APJ, with respective IC50 values of 3.3 M and 20.3 M.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

These three loci, Teosinte crossing barrier 1 (Tcb1), Gametophytic factor 1 (Ga1), and Ga2, each play a key role in preventing hybridization between populations and are proposed to maintain the barrier between domesticated and wild subspecies. Each locus encodes a matching pair of silk- and pollen-active pectin methylesterases (PMEs). To investigate the diversity and molecular evolution of these gametophytic factor loci, we identified existing and improved models of the responsible genes in a new genome assembly which contains active versions of all three loci. We then examined fifty-two assembled genomes from seventeen species to classify haplotype diversity and identify sites under diversifying selection during the evolution of the causal genes. We show that Ga2, the oldest of these three loci, was duplicated to form Ga1 at least 12 million years ago. Tcb1, the youngest locus, arose as a duplicate of Ga1 before or around the time of diversification of the Zea genus. We find evidence of positive selection during evolution of the functional genes at an active site in the pollen-expressed PME and predicted surface sites in both the silk- and pollen-expressed PMEs. The most common allele at the Ga1 locus is a conserved ga1 allele (ga1-O), which is non-coding due to conserved stop codons in full-length gene copies that are between 610 thousand and 1.5 million years old. We show that the ga1-O allele is associated with and likely generates 24-nt siRNAs in developing pollen-producing tissue, and these siRNAs map to functional Ga1 alleles. In previously-published crosses, the ga1-O allele associates with reduced function of the typically dominant functional alleles for the Ga1 and Tcb1 barriers. Taken together, this seems to be an example of a type of epigenetic trans-homolog silencing known as paramutation functioning at a locus controlling a reproductive barrier.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Despite its crucial role, the structural basis of this competitive binding dynamics remains elusive owing to the lack of structural data and the inherent flexibility of these peptides. Using structural modeling, molecular docking, and simulations, this study reveals that PCP-B{gamma} binds to the same negatively charged pocket in the FERONIA-LLG2 complex as RALF23, displacing and interrupting the heterodimerized structure, thus reducing ROS levels to promote pollination.

Under challenging environmental conditions, such as low temperatures and high light intensities, plants need to immediately adjust their metabolism to prevent irreversible tissue damage, e.g., caused by reactive oxygen species. Regulation of photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism plays a crucial role in this stress response. Here, we analysed mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, which were affected in either central enzymatic activities of carbohydrate metabolism, in chloroplast positioning or in a combination of both. Plants were exposed to a treatment of combined cold and elevated light. While mutants with deficiencies in sucrose (spsa1) or starch (pgm1) metabolism showed affected metabolic pathway regulation under abiotic stress, Hexokinase 1 mutants (hxk1) showed a severe growth phenotype with lesions and pale areas on leaf tissue. In a double mutant, which combined deficiencies in Chloroplast Unusual Positioning 1 (CHUP1)-mediated chloroplast positioning and HXK1 (chup1 x hxk1), this growth phenotype vanished resulting in wild type-like plants. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significantly affected immune response of hxk1 plants, which was suppressed in the double mutants. Our findings provide evidence for a role of HXK1 as a positive regulator of the plant immune response. Finally, we suggest that, due to its potential role as a negative regulator of plant immunity, CHUP1 deficiency counteracted the reduced immunity of hxk1 in the double mutant which rescued the plants. Future studies might now reveal whether deficiencies in CHUP1 function and/or transcription represent a conserved strategy to increase plant immunity under abiotic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Herein, we devise a live-cell microscopy-based approach to follow hydroxyurea-induced fork stalling and subsequent restart at 30-s resolution. We measure two distinct processes during fork stalling. One is rapid PCNA removal, which reflects the drop in DNA synthesis. The other is gradual RPA1 accumulation on up to 2400 nt of ssDNA per fork despite an active intra-S checkpoint. Restoring the nucleotide pool enables prompt restart without post-replicative ssDNA and a smooth cell cycle progression. ATR, but not ATM inhibition, accelerates hydroxyurea-induced RPA1 accumulation nine-fold, leading to RPA1 exhaustion within 20 min. Fork restart under ATR inhibition led to the persistence of ~600 nt ssDNA per fork after S-phase, which reached 2500 nt under ATR/ATM co-inhibition, with both scenarios leading to mitotic catastrophe. MRE11 inhibition had no effect on PCNA/RPA1 dynamics regardless of ATR activity. E3 ligase RAD18 was recruited at stalled replication forks in parallel to PCNA removal.

At the same time, these new capabilities are creating potential biosecurity challenges by providing new pathways to intentional or accidental synthesis of genes that encode hazardous proteins. The synthesis of nucleic acids is a key choke point in the AI-assisted protein engineering pipeline as it is where digital designs are transformed into physical instructions that can produce potentially harmful proteins. Thus, one focus for efforts to enhance biosecurity in the face of new AI-enabled capabilities is on bolstering the screening of orders by nucleic acid synthesis providers. We describe a multistakeholder, cross-sector effort to address biosecurity challenges with uses of AI-powered biological design tools to reformulate naturally occurring proteins of concern to create synthetic homologs that have low sequence identity to the wild-type proteins. We evaluated the abilities of traditional nucleic acid biosecurity screening tools to detect these synthetic homologs and found that, of tools tested, not all could previously detect such AI-redesigned sequences reliably. However, as we report, patches were built and deployed to improve detection rates over the course of the project, resulting in a final mean detection rate over tools of 97% of the synthetic homologs that were determined, using in-silico metrics, to be more likely to retain wild-type-like function.

While movement plans can be computed relative to the world (extrinsic), intrinsic muscle commands tuned for current limb posture are ultimately needed to execute spatially accurate movements. The whole-brain topology and dynamics of this process are largely unknown. Here, we use high spatiotemporal resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans combined with a Pro-/Anti-wrist pointing task with 2 opposing forearm postures to investigate this question. First, we computed cortical source activity in 16 previously identified bilateral cortical areas (Alikhanian, et al., Frontiers in Neuroscience 2013). We then contrasted oscillatory activity related to opposing wrist postures to find posture coding and test when and where extrinsic and intrinsic motor codes occurred. We found a distinct pair of overlapping networks coding for posture (predominantly in {gamma} band) vs. posture-specific movement plans ( and {beta}). Some areas (e.g., pIPS) only showed extrinsic motor coding, and others (e.g., AG) only showed intrinsic coding, but the majority showed both types of codes. In the latter case, intrinsic codes appeared slightly before extrinsic codes and persisted in parallel across different cortical areas. These findings are consistent with two cortical networks for 1) direct feed-forward sensorimotor transformations to intrinsic muscle coordinates (for rapid control) and 2) computations of extrinsic spatial coordinates, possibly for use in higher-level aspects of visually-guided action, such as spatial updating and internal performance monitoring.

Significance statement / author summaryIt is thought that the brain incorporates posture into extrinsic spatial codes to compute intrinsic (muscle-centered) motor commands, but the whole-brain temporal dynamics of this process is unknown. Here we employed human magneto-encephalography (MEG) to track this process across 16 bilateral cortical sites. We identified two, largely overlapping subnetworks for posture-dependent intrinsic codes, and extrinsic spatial coding. Surprisingly, the direct transformation from sensorimotor coordinates to intrinsic commands preceded the appearance of extrinsic codes, suggesting that extrinsic motor codes are derived from intrinsic codes for higher-level cognitive purposes.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Regrettably, this was accomplished only for individual, tissue-dissociated cells. High-plex spatial biology has begun to recover the x, y, and z-coordinates of single-cells, but typically at the expense of far less than whole transcriptome coverage. To solve this problem, Bruker Spatial Biology has accomplished a commercial-grade panel (CosMx(R) Spatial Molecular Imager Whole Transcriptome Panel (WTx)), using 37,872 imaging barcodes, capable of sub-cellular imaging of the entire human protein-coding transcriptome. The imaging barcodes are encoded with 156 bits of information (4 on-cycles and 35 dark-cycles per code), at a Hamming Distance of 4 from each other to achieve a very low false-code detection. Key to achieving this high-plex capability was the ability to manufacture imaging barcodes that require no in-tissue amplification (every barcode is manufactured under GMP to contain exactly 30 fluorescent dyes) and uniform, size-exclusion purified, extremely small imaging barcodes ([~] 20 nm). A detailed study of six different human FFPE tissue types was performed (Colon, Pancreas, Hippocampus, Skin, Breast, Kidney), yielding over 5.4 billion transcripts from 2.7 million cells. We counted over 1,550 transcripts-per-cell on average and observed 900 unique genes per cell (measured as the median). Single fixed-cells containing well over 10,000 subcellularly imaged transcripts were accomplished. Advancing single-cell imaging to the whole transcriptome level opens a single unified approach to accomplish essentially all single-cell experiments, both imaging and non-imaging.

Pathway analysis within the tumor bed of a colon adenocarcinoma sample found evidence of enrichment in pathways suggestive of an aggressive tumor type, and localized ligand-receptor analysis showed spatially restricted patterns related to adhesion, migration, and proliferation. The high-dimensional whole transcriptome data is streamed directly to a cloud-based Spatial Informatics Platform, allowing for the scalable processing of millions-of-single-cells and billions-of-transcripts per operation.

It is widely accepted that the spread of this language family across Europe from the 5th millennium BP correlates with the expansion and diversification of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the onset of the Bronze Age6,7. However, multiple steppe-derived populations co-existed in Europe during this period, and it remains unclear how these populations diverged and which provided the demographic channels for the ancestral forms of the Italic, Celtic, Greek, and Armenian languages8,9. To investigate the ancestral histories of Indo-European-speaking groups in Southern Europe, we sequenced genomes from 314 ancient individuals from the Mediterranean and surrounding regions, spanning from 5,200 BP to 2,100 BP, and co-analysed these with published genome data. We additionally conducted strontium isotope analyses on 224 of these individuals. We find a deep east-west divide of steppe ancestry in Southern Europe during the Bronze Age. Specifically, we show that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Spain, France, and Italy was mediated by Bell Beaker (BB) populations of Western Europe, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages. In contrast, Armenian and Greek populations acquired steppe ancestry directly from Yamnaya groups of Eastern Europe. These results are consistent with the linguistic Italo-Celtic10,11 and Graeco-Armenian1,12,13 hypotheses accounting for the origins of most Mediterranean Indo-European languages of Classical Antiquity. Our findings thus align with specific linguistic divergence models for the Indo-European language family while contradicting others. This underlines the power of ancient DNA in uncovering prehistoric diversifications of human populations and language communities.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Nearly 90% of human genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are located in distal regions, underscoring the importance of enhancers in human development, diseases, and traits. It is widely suggested that mammalian enhancers frequently skip active genes, and thus, linear proximity is a poor predictor of their targets. A key unresolved question is how often mammalian enhancers skip proximal active genes to specifically target distal genes. Genome-wide enhancer-promoter mapping shows that enhancers frequently bypass active genes, while ultra-deep locus-specific analyses reveal extensive multi-way interactions between enhancers and promoters, forming nested microcompartments. The functional significance of these seemingly contrasting phenomena remains unclear.

Here, we compared hundreds of enhancer-target gene pairs identified using enhancer-promoter chromatin contact maps, enhancer-promoter RNA interaction data, and genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) perturbations. Our findings reveal limited overlap between active gene-skipping enhancer-gene pairs identified through physical interaction mapping and CRISPRi. Additionally, promoters involved in multi-way enhancer interactions are not co-regulated by shared coactivators. Notably, gene-skipping and non-skipping enhancers identified via CRISPRi differ fundamentally in chromatin features, gene activation strength, false discovery rates, target gene distance, coactivator requirements, and cell-type specificity of target genes. These results suggest that gene-skipping enhancer-promoter interactions observed in chromatin and RNA-based analyses do not reliably predict functional enhancer-gene relationships. We propose that linear enhancer-promoter proximity and coactivator dependency offer a simple, scalable, and cost-effective method for genome-wide prediction of enhancer and GWAS targets, with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art experimental techniques. While enhancers can skip active genes, such deliberate skipping appears to be the exception rather than the rule.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Previous studies suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms likely play important roles in whole-body regeneration. Here, we establish a resource for studying H. miamia microRNA-mediated gene regulation, a major aspect of post-transcriptional control in animals. Using small RNA-sequencing samples spanning key developmental stages, we annotated H. miamia microRNAs. Our analysis uncovered a total of 1,050 microRNA loci, including 479 high-confidence loci based on structural and read abundance criteria. Comparison of microRNA seed sequences with those in other bilaterian species revealed that H. miamia encodes the majority of known conserved bilaterian microRNA families and that several microRNA families previously reported only in protostomes or deuterostomes likely have ancient bilaterian origins. We profiled the expression dynamics of the H. miamia miRNAs across embryonic and post-embryonic development. We observed that the let-7 and mir-125 microRNAs are unconventionally enriched at early embryonic stages. To generate hypotheses for miRNA function, we annotated the 3 UTRs of H. miamia protein-coding genes and performed miRNA target site predictions. Focusing on genes that are known to function in the wound response, posterior patterning, and neural differentiation in H. miamia, we found that these processes may be under substantial miRNA regulation. Notably, we found that miRNAs in MIR-7 and MIR-9 families which have target sites in the posterior genes fz-1, wnt-3, and sp5 are indeed expressed in the anterior of the animal, consistent with a repressive effect on their corresponding target genes. Our annotation offers candidate miRNAs for further functional investigation, providing a resource for future studies of post-transcriptional control during development and regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

In type 2 diabetes (T2D), islet GlyR activity is impaired by unknown mechanisms. We sought to investigate if the GlyR dysfunction in T2D is replicated by hyperglycemia per se, and to further characterize its action in {beta} cells and islets.

MethodsGlyR-mediated currents were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp in human {beta} cells from donors with or without T2D, or after high glucose (15 mM) culture. We also correlated glycine-induced current amplitude with transcript expression levels through patch-seq. The expression of the GlyR 1, 3, and {beta} subunit mRNA splice variants was compared between islets from donors with and without T2D, and after high glucose culture. Insulin secretion from human islets was measured in the presence or absence of the GlyR antagonist strychnine.

ResultsAlthough gene expression of GlyRs was decreased in T2D islets, and {beta} cell GlyR-mediated currents were smaller, we found no evidence for a shift in GlyR subunit splicing. Glycine-induced currents are also reduced after 48 hours culture of islets from donors without diabetes in high glucose, where we also find the reduction of the 1 subunit expression, but an increase in the 3 subunit. We discovered that glycine-evoked currents are highly heterogeneous amongst {beta} cells, inversely correlate with donor HbA1c, and are significantly correlated to the expression of 92 different transcripts and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that include CREB3(+), RREB1(+) and ZNF697(+). Finally, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is decreased in the presence of the GlyR antagonist strychnine.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate that glucose can modulate GlyR expression, and that the current decrease in T2D is likely due to the receptor gene expression downregulation, and not a change in transcript splicing. Moreover, we define a previously unknown set of genes and regulons that are correlated to GlyR-mediated currents and could be involved in GlyR downregulation in T2D.

Here, we investigate the efficacy of different noise mitigation pipelines, including white-matter and cerebrospinal fluid regression, independent component analysis (ICA) - based artefact removal, volume censoring, global signal regression (GSR), and diffuse cluster estimation and regression (DiCER), in simultaneously achieving two objectives: mitigating motion-related artifacts and augmenting brain-behaviour associations. Our analysis, which employed three distinct quality control metrics to evaluate motion influence and a kernel ridge regression for behavioural predictions of 81 different behavioural variables across two independent datasets, revealed that no single pipeline universally excels at achieving both objectives consistently across different cohorts. Pipelines combining ICA-FIX and GSR demonstrate a reasonable trade-off between motion reduction and behavioural prediction performance, but inter-pipeline variations in predictive performance are modest.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

To counteract this, cells deploy dedicated silencing factors, such as the E3 ligase SIFI that terminates the mitochondrial stress response. How a single enzyme can sense stress across cells and elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here, we report the structure of human SIFI, which revealed how this 1.3MDa complex can target hundreds of proteins for accurate stress response silencing. SIFI attaches the first ubiquitin to substrates using flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, yet builds linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at distinct, sterically restricted elongation modules in its periphery. Ubiquitin handover via a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to precise chain elongation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared to process many diverse proteins and hence allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if appropriate, modulate a complex cellular state.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

These two groups of taxa show contrasting trends in the molecular mechanisms of 3D chromatin organization and long-term evolutionary dynamics of cis-regulatory element (CREs) conservation. To help us identify shared versus derived features that could be responsible for the evolution of these different regulatory architectures in animals, we studied the evolution and organization of the regulatory genome of echinoderms, a lineage whose phylogenetic position and relatively slow molecular evolution has proven particularly useful for evolutionary studies. First, using PacBio and HiC data, we generated new reference genome assemblies for two species belonging to two different echinoderm classes: the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the bat sea star Patiria miniata. Second, we characterized their 3D chromatin architecture, identifying TAD-like domains in echinoderms that, like in flies, do not seem to be associated with CTCF motif orientation. Third, we systematically profiled CREs during sea star and sea urchin development using ATAC-seq, comparing their regulatory logic and dynamics over multiple developmental stages. Finally, we investigated sea urchin and sea star CRE evolution across multiple evolutionary distances and timescales, from closely related species to other echinoderm classes and deuterostome lineages. This showed the presence of several thousand elements conserved for hundreds of millions of years, revealing a vertebrate-like pattern of CRE evolution that probably constitutes an ancestral property of the regulatory evolution of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

The recent approval of TCR-gene-edited T cells for cancer therapy demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of using pMHC recognition to eliminate cancer. However, identification and selection of TCRs from patient material is complex and influenced by the TCR repertoire of the donors used. To overcome these limitations, we here present a rapid and robust de novo binder design platform leveraging state-of-the-art generative models, including RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2, to engineer minibinders (miBds) targeting the cancer-associated pMHC complex, NY-ESO-1(157-165)/HLA-A*02:01. By incorporating in silico cross-panning and molecular dynamics simulations, we enhanced specificity screening to minimise off-target interactions. We identified a miBd that exhibited high specificity for the NY-ESO-1-derived peptide SLLMWITQC in complex with HLA-A*02:01 and minimal cross-reactivity in mammalian display assays. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this miBd by integrating it into a chimeric antigen receptor, as de novo Binders for Immune-mediated Killing Engagers (BIKEs). BIKE-transduced T cells selectively and effectively killed NY-ESO-1+ melanoma cells compared to non-transduced controls, demonstrating the promise of this approach in precision cancer immunotherapy.

Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk for human affective disorders involving dysregulated reward behaviors. In mice, ELA causes anhedonia-like behaviors in males and augmented reward motivation in females, indicating sex-dependent disruption of reward circuit operations. We recently identified a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing GABAergic projection from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that governs reward-seeking deficits in adult ELA males--but not females.

MethodsTo probe the sex-specific role of this projection in reward behaviors, adult male and female CRH-Cre mice raised in control or ELA conditions received excitatory or inhibitory Cre-dependent DREADDs in BLA, and then clozapine N-oxide or vehicle to NAc medial shell during reward behaviors. We determined the cell identity of the projection using immunostaining and electrophysiology. Using tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy and deep learning pipelines, we mapped brain-wide BLA CRH+ axonal projections to uncover sex differences in innervation.

ResultsChemogenetic manipulations in male mice demonstrated inhibitory effects of the CRH+ BLA-NAc projection on reward behaviors, whereas neither excitation nor inhibition influenced female behaviors. Molecular and electrophysiological cell-identities of the projection did not vary by sex. By contrast, comprehensive whole-brain mapping uncovered significant differences in NAc innervation patterns that were both sex and ELA-dependent, as well as selective changes of innervation of other brain regions.

ConclusionsThe CRH/GABA BLA-NAc projection that influences reward behaviors in males differs structurally and functionally in females, uncovering potential mechanisms for the profound sex-specific impacts of ELA on reward behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

With the advance of population genomics, studies in diverse organisms revealed supergenes associated with a myriad of complex traits, ranging from morphology to sexual behavior, from butterfly wing patterns to floral morphs. Two supergenes have been described on non-homologous ""social chromosomes"" in two ant lineages, Solenopsis and Formica, that diverged more than 90 million years ago. In both lineages, the supergene is associated with social polymorphism, where some colonies are headed by a single queen (monogyne) while others harbor multiple queens (polygyne). We discovered a new supergene associated with similar social polymorphism in the desert ant Cataglyphis niger. Although Cataglyphis is more closely related to Formica than to Solenopsis, the social chromosome in C. niger is homologous to the Solenopsis social chromosome, with conservation of synteny in gene content as well as gene order. Therefore, this is an ancient chromosome dating back to the common ancestor of Solenopsis and Cataglyphis, at least 90 million years ago. Previous work dated the Solenopsis supergene to be only one million years old, therefore, we propose that the two supergenes have evolved independently in the two diverged lineages on this ancient social chromosome. We surveyed hymenopteran genomes to discover a bee chromosome homologous to the ants social chromosome. The conservation of the gene set on these homologous chromosomes in ants and bees suggests that this chromosome plays an important role in social behavior across social Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that the conserved gene set in the social chromosome was repeatedly used as a pre-adapted toolkit for the evolution of social traits in general and specifically in the evolution of polygyne social structure in ants.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Here, using experimental evolution, we show that the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can adapt to freeze-thaw stress in a stereotyped manner, with survival increasing nearly two orders of magnitude from {approx}2% to {approx}70% in about 25 cycles of stress exposure. Adapted cells exhibit reduced membrane damage, smaller sizes, higher mass densities, and a lower prevalence of budding. Rheological measurements show that the adapted cells are stiffer and exhibit lower particle mobilities within the cytoplasm. Whole genome sequencing indicates that increased survival is not accompanied by specific (unique) genetic changes, but rather is associated with multiple, distinct genotypes. Concomitant with mechanical changes in the adapted cells, the basal intracellular level of trehalose, a sugar speculated to play a physical role in maintaining membrane and cytoplasmic integrity, exhibits a three-fold increase. Together, these cellular attributes strongly correlate with the entry of cells into a quiescence-like state. A quantitative model that incorporates selection based on cellular quiescence recapitulates the adaptation dynamics, i.e. increase in survival and trehalose levels, seen in experiments. Finally, we find that the evolved mechano-chemical phenotypes are similar even when we use qualitatively different freeze-thaw selection protocols for the evolution, hinting at a convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Uptake of peptides by S. aureus involves at least two transport systems: the POT family di/tri-peptide permease DtpT and the oligopeptide ABC transporter Opp3. Here we study the individual and combined functions of DtpT and Opp3 in enabling utilisation of 282 di-/tri-peptides via a high-throughput phenotypic screen. We reveal that many peptides can be utilised via either transporter, though DtpT appears to be the primary route of uptake for dipeptides. Intriguingly, we demonstrate a preference for Asp/Glu-containing peptides among putative DtpT substrates. To measure DtpT-mediated peptide transport directly, the protein was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes and active transport of diverse di- and tri-peptides was demonstrated, supporting the conclusions of the phenotypic screen. During this in vitro analysis, we also found that DtpT could transport the biologically prevalent tripeptide reduced glutathione (GSH). In the absence of the known glutathione transporter Gis, dtpT is essential for growth under conditions where GSH is supplied as the sole sulphur source, identifying DtpT as the predicted second GSH uptake system of S. aureus. Site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted ligand binding site of DtpT suggests GSH binds the protein vertically in a manner dependent on interactions with Gln310. Finally, we demonstrate that GSH transport is required by S. aureus for complete fitness during in vitro macrophage infection experiments, and our data suggest that GSH uptake plays a role in modulating host-pathogen interactions in these infections. Together, these data reveal important new functions for DtpT, both in the utilisation of diverse peptides for growth but also providing the first clues toward a distinct role of DtpT during intracellular infection.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Current light-sheet stabilization methods rely on fluorescence emission from the sample, which may interrupt the scientific imaging and add to sample photobleaching. Here we show that for oblique plane microscopes (OPM), a subset of LSFM where a single primary objective is used for illumination and detection, light-sheet stabilization can be achieved without expending sample fluorescence. Our method achieves ~43nm axial precision and maintains the light-sheet well within the depth of focus of the detection system for hour-long acquisition runs in a lab environment that would otherwise detune the system.

Given the high incidence and deleterious consequences of epileptiform activity in AD, we hypothesized neuronal hyperactivity and seizures are key factors in tau spread. To examine these interactions, we created a novel mouse model involving the cross of targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP) mice and the 5 times familial AD (5XFAD; 5X-TRAP) model allowing for the permanent fluorescent labelling of neuronal activity. To establish a causal role of seizures in tau spread, we seeded mice with human AD brain-derived tau lysate and induced seizures with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling. Comprehensive brain mapping of tau pathology and neuronal activity revealed that basal hyperactivity in 5X-TRAP mice was associated with increased tau spread, which was exacerbated by seizure induction through activated networks and correlated with memory deficits. Computational modeling revealed that anterograde tau spread was elevated in 5X-TRAP mice and that regional neuronal activity was predictive of tau spread to that brain region. On a cellular level, we found that in both saline and PTZ-treated 5X-TRAP mice, hyperactive neurons disproportionately contributed to the spread of tau. Further, we found that Synaptogyrin-3, a synaptic vesicle protein that interacts with tau, was increased following PTZ kindling in 5X-TRAP mice, possibly indicative of a synaptic mechanism underlying seizure-exacerbated tau spread. Importantly, postmortem AD brain tissue from patients with a history of seizures showed increased tau pathology in patterns indicative of increased spread and increased Synaptogyrin-3 levels compared to those without seizures. Overall, our study identifies neuronal hyperactivity and seizures as key factors underlying the pathobiological and cognitive progression of AD. Therapies targeting these factors should be tested clinically to slow tau spread and AD progression.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

The replisome-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP mitigates this threat by ubiquitylating the CMG helicase in mitosis, leading to disassembly of stalled replisomes, fork cleavage, and restoration of chromosome structure by alternative end-joining. Here, we show that replisome disassembly requires TRAIP phosphorylation by the mitotic Cyclin B-CDK1 kinase, as well as TTF2, a SWI/SNF ATPase previously implicated in the eviction of RNA polymerase from mitotic chromosomes. We find that TTF2 tethers TRAIP to replisomes using an N-terminal Zinc finger that binds to phosphorylated TRAIP and an adjacent TTF2 peptide that contacts the CMG-associated leading strand DNA polymerase {varepsilon}. This TRAIP-TTF2-pol {varepsilon} bridge, which forms independently of the TTF2 ATPase domain, is essential to promote CMG unloading and stalled fork breakage. Conversely, RNAPII eviction from mitotic chromosomes requires the ATPase activity of TTF2. We conclude that in mitosis, replisomes undergo a CDK- and TTF2-dependent structural reorganization that underlies the cellular response to incompletely replicated DNA.","NA","biorxiv",1733436544299

Its strength rivals that of many synthetic fibres used commercially, rendering it applicable across various industrial and medical domains. However, its widespread utilisation requires cost-effective mass production. Biotechnology presents a promising avenue for achieving this goal, particularly through the production of recombinant dragline silk proteins in transgenic plant systems. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of producing one key protein component of dragline silk, MaSp1, from the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, (LhMaSp1) in the moss Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens). Here, we present the successful recombinant production of spider silk protein containing both the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of LhMaSp1 protein in moss cells. NTD and CTD are necessary domains for protein assembly in spider silk. The production of recombinant LhMaSp1 protein in Physcomitrella was performed in shake flasks and in five-litre photobioreactors and the correct synthesis of LhMaSp1 was proven via mass spectrometry.

To uncover the evolutionary diversity of ribosome biogenesis, we analyzed over 30,000 bacterial genomes and revealed that Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), also known as the phylum Patescibacteria, characterized by reduced genomes and smaller ribosomes, has about half the average number of RBFs compared with non-CPR bacteria. Notably, key RBFs such as der, obgE, and rbfA, considered indispensable, are conserved in only around 20%-70% of CPR genomes. Since such repertoires were not observed in reduced genomes of other phyla, CPR presumably diverged early in bacterial evolution. We further confirmed that ribosomal structural changes correlate with reduced RBFs, evidencing co-evolution between RBFs and the ribosome. These findings suggest that ribosomal biogenesis is more flexible than recognized, and the small cell and genome sizes of CPR bacteria and their early divergence may influence the unusual repertoires of RBFs.

Mechanical cues exerted by shear stress from the blood flow remodel an initial vascular plexus into a ramifying array of large and small vessels. As plasma starts to fill vascular lumens, these forces trigger changes in EC gene expression and dynamic alterations in cell shape and cell adhesion, as cuboidal angioblasts elongate and flatten into ECs. Little is known about how embryonic ECs sense and transduce hemodynamic signals as vessels form in vivo. Here, we report a critical requirement for the Lats1 and Lats2 Hippo pathway kinases during this process. We show that when Lats1/2 are genetically deleted in ECs, embryos develop severe defects in blood vessel formation, which lead to embryonic lethality by E11.5. We find that initial vessel patterning and circulation initiate properly, however remodeling of the initial vascular plexus fails due to lumen collapse and altered blood flow. When Lats1/2 are knocked down using siRNA approaches in cultured ECs, cells fail to elongate and polarize, similar to ECs in the mutant embryos. In addition, VE-cadherin (VEcad) based junctions fail to mature under shear stress. These data show that Lats1/2 deficient cells no longer respond to laminar shear stress, both in vivo and in vitro. This work identifies the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1 and Lats2 as critical transducers of biomechanical cues during the early steps of blood vessel remodeling. This study will provide new targets for treatment of vascular diseases and new directions for efforts to generate vascularized tissues for replacement therapies.

We then further characterized the impact of a newly isolated Klebsiella oxytoca strain (UMKO1) on the pancreatic tumor microenvironment using bacterial genome sequencing, untargeted and targeted metabolomics, as well as an ex vivo tumor transplant system. We found that UMKO1 possesses a gene for the long form of cytidine deaminase, which can inactivate the standard PDAC chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine. In addition, we found that UMKO1 can produce several indoles when grown in tumor-like conditions, metabolites that can lead to an immune suppressive environment and interfere with therapy outcome. To test this in detail, we assessed changes in immune populations in pancreatic tumor explants upon exposure to the supernatant of UMKO1 and other isolated bacteria grown in tumor Interstitial fluid media (TIFM). We found that while none of the bacterial supernatants changed the abundance of CD8 T cells, granzyme B positive CD8 T cells were the lowest in tumor explants exposed to UMKO1, and not other isolated Klebsiella species or the non-pathogenic laboratory strain E. coli K12.

Therefore, we collected predicted protein structures from hyperthermophiles, which differ substantially in their amino acid composition from mesophiles. Notably, ProteinMPNN fails to recover their unique amino acid composition.

In the evolutionary transition from C3 to the more efficient C4 photosynthesis, restricting the glycine decarboxylase reaction to bundle sheath cells initiates a carbon concentrating mechanism via the photorespiratory glycine shuttle. This evolutionary step is generally thought to play an essential role in the progression from ancestral C3 to C4 photosynthesis. Plants operating this shuttle are often referred to as C3-C4 intermediates or C2 species. Within the Brassicaceae family, which includes model plants and crops, such species have evolved independently at least five times. However, research on the biochemistry of C3-C4 intermediates in the Brassicaceae has been limited to a few case studies of differentially localized proteins between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Here, we leveraged recent advances in single-cell transcriptome sequencing to better understand how new cellular specialization affects interconnected pathways. We generated a single-nuclei RNA sequencing dataset for Moricandia arvensis, a Brassicaceae with C3-C4 intermediate characteristics, and compared it to a publicly available single-cell transcriptome of leaf tissue of the C3 Arabidopsis thaliana. We independently confirmed the localization of selected photorespiratory proteins by electron microscopy of immunogold-labelled leaf sections. Our analysis revealed the shift in expression of genes directly associated with the photorespiratory glycine decarboxylase reaction, but also of related pathways, such as ammonium assimilation, synthesis of specific amino acids, redox regulation, and transport to the M. arvensis bundle sheath. In contrast, the expression of these genes was not restricted to this cell type in the C3 plant.

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024.

PREVENT-19 (NCT04611802/2019nCoV-301), a pivotal phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated robust efficacy of a primary, 2-dose series of NVX-CoV2373 against COVID-19.

MethodsProtocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered [&ge;]6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.

ResultsImmune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals.

MethodsThis phase 3, open-label study (2019nCoV-312/NCT05875701) enrolled participants who received one dose of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 protein-based vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) in an earlier study (2019nCoV-307/NCT05463068) after a primary series and possibly one additional dose of mRNA vaccine. In the current study, participants received an additional dose of protein-based vaccine (ancestral [n=104] or Omicron BA.5 [n=40]) at least 180 days after their previous study dose. The primary objective was demonstration of noninferiority of neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers induced by the dose in this study versus the first dose of NVX-CoV-2373 in the earlier study. Safety was also evaluated.

ResultsA total of 144 participants were enrolled. The ratio of anti-Wuhan nAbs (GMT, IU/mL [95% CI]) at Day 28 after this study dose (ancestral 393.2 [318.0-468.2]) versus previous study dose (396.6 [328.7-478.6]) was 1.0 (0.8, 1.2), meeting noninferiority. The seroresponse rate difference between doses was 7.4% (95% CI = -1.2%-16.5%), also meeting noninferiority. Omicron BA.5 nAb titers suggest cross-protection against emerging variants. The nAb ratio at Day 28 between Omicron dose in this study (835.0 [597.1-1167.6]) versus previous study ancestral dose (436.0 [305.6-622.2]) was 1.9 (1.5-2.5), exceeding superiority criterion. Local and systemic reactions were similar between doses and strains in both studies.

ConclusionsA heterologous regimen of two adjuvanted recombinant spike protein-based vaccine doses after mRNA vaccination produced robust immune responses, exhibiting cross-reactivity to newer variants.","NA","medrxiv",1733436544299

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Routine national levels surveillance of COVID-19 outcomes is essential to monitor populations most of severe disease and informing vaccination policy.","NA","medrxiv",1733436544299

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1733436544299

Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of the clonal landscapes of human tissues, and their impact on cancer risk, ageing and disease, remains limited due to the challenge of detecting somatic mutations present in small numbers of cells. Here, we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq)11, a duplex sequencing method with error rates <5 errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity enables the simultaneous detection of mutations in large numbers of clones, yielding accurate somatic mutation rates, mutational signatures and driver mutation frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 samples of blood from a twin cohort, we found an unprecedentedly rich landscape of selection, with 49 genes under positive selection driving clonal expansions in the oral epithelium, over 62,000 driver mutations, and evidence of negative selection in some genes. The high number of positively selected mutations in multiple genes provides high-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites, a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how carcinogenic exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing has the potential to unveil the polyclonal landscape of any tissue, providing a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.","NA","medrxiv",1733436544299

Mechanical thrombectomy has become a standard treatment to remove obstructive clots, providing a unique opportunity to analyze their properties. We previously demonstrated that blood can clot into an amyloid-like form, generating fibrinaloid microclots (2-200 m) that are highly resistant to fibrinolysis. In this study, archived clots from eight ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion were examined, using samples stored in the Walton Centre Clot Bank in Liverpool, UK. All clots exhibited strong, heterogeneous amyloid staining, revealing a pervasive amyloid component. These findings represent a previously unreported characteristic of stroke clots, highlighting the potential for amyloid-targeted therapies to overcome their fibrinolytic resistance and providing a foundational new insight into ischaemic stroke pathophysiology and treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1733436544299
