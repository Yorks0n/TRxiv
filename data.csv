However, their analysis is complicated by measurement noise and bias, differences between batches, technology platforms, and restricted antibody panels. This results in a limited capacity to accumulate knowledge across technologies, studies, experimental batches, or across different antibody panels. Here, we present CytoVI - a probabilistic generative model designed to address these challenges and enable statistically rigorous and integrative analysis for antibody-based single cell technologies. We show that CytoVI outperforms existing computational methods and effectively handles a variety of integration scenarios. CytoVI enables key functionalities such as generating informative cell embeddings, imputing missing measurements, differential protein expression testing, and automated annotation of cells. We applied CytoVI to generate an integrated B cell maturation atlas across 350 proteins from a set of smaller antibody panels measured by conventional mass cytometry, and identified proteins associated with immunoglobulin class-switching in healthy humans. Using a cohort of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients measured by flow cytometry, CytoVI uncovered T cell states that are associated with disease. Finally, we show that CytoVI is a robust probabilistic framework for the analysis of standard diagnostic flow cytometry antibody panels, enabling the automated detection of tumor populations and diagnoses of incoming patient samples. CytoVI facilitates accurate and automated analysis in both preclinical and clinical settings and is available as open-source software at scvi-tools.org.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101055341-TROJAN-Cel;IMME- DIATE EU#: 101095540;MiTE, 101123436;101106452; STIC-GBM;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""259373024;441891347;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS4-0000000121;EOSS6-0000000388;DAF2022-249318;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R61DA048444;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

Reaggregated early gastrula cells (here called gastruloids) of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis are able to regenerate with only little delay whole organisms that are virtually indistinguishable from normal developing polyps. However, the molecular control underlying the restoration of body axis and germ layers remains largely unknown. To address this, we established a standardized protocol, which reproducibly generates gastruloids developing into polys with a single body axis. Here, we show that committed mesodermal and endodermal cells are sorted out to the surface of the aggregate, where mesodermal cells form clusters of about 30 cells. At a critical time point, one mesodermal cluster immigrates, along with peripherally attached endodermal cells. Thereby, the inner germ layer and the oral-aboral axis is established in one and the same process. Functional studies demonstrated that this polarization of the endodermal cells requires a feedback loop of Notch and Wnt signaling. The dissociation of the early embryo disrupts Notch signaling in the endodermal cells, which leads to transient adoption of an endomesodermal profile, marked by the expression of the mesodermal cadherin1 until the boundaries between the germ layer identities are re-established. Our results highlight distinct morphogenetic behaviors of mesodermal and endodermal cells and the hitherto unknown role of Notch signaling in germ layer boundary formation in self-organizing gastruloids. Conservation of Notch-mediated boundary formation between endoderm and mesoderm mirrors bilaterian mechanisms, demonstrating how adoption of ancestral regulatory networks governing morphogenesis likely enabled the diversification of metazoan body plans.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P34404;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

Here, we combined high-density EEG with a serial awakening paradigm during NREM sleep to examine its neural and experiential correlates. As expected, deeper sleep was associated with reduced cortical activation, reflected in a lower high-to-low frequency power ratio. Yet, this relationship weakened in the presence of dreaming, indicating that immersive conscious experiences can counteract the impact of cortical activation on perceived depth. Indeed, perceived sleep depth was lowest during states with a mere sense of presence and highest during immersive dreaming or deep unconsciousness. Across the night, physiological sleep pressure and subjective sleepiness declined, but perceived sleep depth rose alongside increasing dream immersiveness. These results challenge the view that deep sleep stems solely from reduced brain activity and suggest that immersive dreaming sustains perceived sleep depth as homeostatic pressure wanes.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""948891;""},{""name"":""Ministero dell'Universit√† e della Ricerca"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R2049C8YN3;2022BNE97C;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

It is critically dependent on ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a mitochondrial reductase that facilitates cuproptosis by reducing ionophore-bound Cu(II) to Cu(I), which triggers its release, and by promoting mitochondrial protein lipoylation, which is directly targeted by the released Cu to drive cell death. Despite the pivotal role of FDX1 in cuproptosis, the structural determinants underlying its distinct functions remain unclear. To address this, we performed deep mutational scanning (DMS) of FDX1 and identified two conserved residues, D136 and D139, on -helix 3 that are critical for both FDX1-mediated lipoylation and cuproptosis. Charge-reversal mutations at these positions abolished FDX1 ability to support lipoylation and induce cuproptosis in cells, despite retaining full enzymatic activity in vitro. Guided by structural and genomic analyses, we further identified dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), the E3 subunit of lipoylated complexes as an alternative FDX1 reductase both in cells and in vitro. Together, these findings establish -helix 3 of FDX1 as a critical interface for its upstream regulation and suggest that FDX1 roles in lipoylation and cuproptosis are both structurally and functionally linked.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA279550;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

Our approach provides a generalizable framework for dissecting essential protein function in vivo, expanding the capacity to map critical residues underlying essential cellular processes. We applied this strategy to NRD1, encoding an essential RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) termination factor and performed a systematic alanine scanning with near-saturation coverage. We discovered novel and unexpected lethal mutations in the CTD-interacting domain (CID), thus revealing an unanticipated importance for this domain.

Mapping receptor distributions in the brain is therefore necessary for understanding how neurotransmitter systems mediate the link between brain structure and function. Normative receptor density can be estimated using group averages from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. However, the generalizability and reliability of group-average receptor maps depends on the inter-individual variability of receptor density, which is currently unknown. Here we collect group standard deviation brain maps of PET-estimated protein abundance for 12 different neurotransmitter receptors and transporters across 7 neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, cannabinoid, and opioid. We illustrate how cortical and subcortical inter-individual variability of receptor and transporter density varies across brain regions and across neurotransmitter systems. We complement inter-individual variability with inter-regional variability, and show that receptors that vary more across brain regions than across individuals also demonstrate greater out-of-sample spatial consistency. Altogether, this work quantifies how receptor systems vary in healthy individuals, and provides a means of assessing the generalizability of PET-derived receptor density quantification.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis (PPH) is the first comprehensive predictive coding model explaining ASMRs underlying neural mechanism. PPH posits that near-field acoustic cues from common ASMR triggers (e.g., brushing sounds, whispered speech) engage the audio-tactile Peripersonal Space Network, generating a top-down prediction of gentle C-tactile (CT) touch on CT fibre-rich skin of the scalp and neck. This prediction suppresses locus coeruleus (LC) arousal and increases vagal output, offering a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenons therapeutic benefits. In a subjective-experience survey (N = 64), ASMR-labelled trials were rated significantly more pleasant but only slightly more arousing than controls. Pleasantness predicted both the presence and intensity of tingles, supporting PPHs core claim that hedonic value, rather than sympathetic activation, drives the graded somatosensory response. PPH situates ASMR within the Neurovisceral Integration framework, predicting measurable Central Nervous System-Autonomic Nervous System (CNS-ANS) markers (beta-band desynchronisation in the posterior insula and proportional increases in high-frequency heart rate variability with tingle intensity). It further predicts reduced LC activity during ASMR, stronger effects in individuals with high interoceptive prediction error (e.g., anxiety, autism), and attenuation of tingles when spatial proximity cues are removed. By integrating auditory proximity, CT-touch anticipation, and autonomic regulation into a single predictive-coding account, PPH provides a unified, testable framework for explaining ASMR, offering a blueprint for translating this sensory phenomenon into targeted, evidence-based interventions for anxiety and sleep disorders.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

To reveal how these processes are mechanistically linked, we combined acute molecule perturbations in live cells with correlative 3D electron tomography or MINFLUX super-resolution microscopy. We show that degrading Nup62 during mitosis arrests NPC assembly at an intermediate step with smaller membrane pores and removes the whole central transport channel. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that 32 copies of the central channel subcomplex, recruited into the previously unoccupied pore center, can self-associate via hydrophobic interactions to occupy the volume required for full pore size and exert an outward pushing force; indeed, disrupting these interactions during NPC assembly blocked pore dilation. Later in mitotic exit, perturbed cells exhibited impaired nuclear import, smaller nuclei, and looser NE spacing. Acute inhibition of nuclear import recapitulated these NE defects without affecting NPC assembly. Together, our findings reveal a new, two-step molecular mechanism linking NPC assembly and NE reformation. First, hydrophobic FG-nucleoporins dilate the assembling nuclear pore to its full width by forming the central transport channel, which then allows nuclear import-driven nuclear expansion leading to tight, regular NE membrane spacing.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project-ID 511488495 - SFB 1638, P06;""},{""name"":""Baden-W√ºrttemberg Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH/NIGMS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM083960;P41GM109824;R01GM112108;F32GM150243;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tx8dq56"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

Somitogenesis, the rhythmic segmentation of vertebrate embryos, is governed by signalling gradients and oscillations in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM)1,2, but the corresponding protein dynamics are largely unknown. Perturbations in this process cause congenital spine disorders and can result in embryonic lethality3. Here, we introduce an integrated proteomics and microfluidics approach to resolve spatiotemporal protein expression in the developing mouse tail. To this end, we established a microfluidic system to synchronize oscillations in embryo tails grown in 3D, which we combined with mass-spectrometry and RNA sequencing. We uncover novel oscillatory proteins and differentially expressed genes along the anteroposterior axis. Building on this dataset, we identify a previously unrecognized antagonistic, dynamic ligand-receptor expression pattern in R-Spondin/LGR signalling explaining how Wnt-oscillation amplitude increases despite decreasing ligand levels in anterior PSM. Dynamic ligand expression was validated in mouse gastruloids. Perturbation of ligand dynamics reduced oscillation amplitude and impaired somite formation. Our study reveals a novel regulatory strategy in which dynamic antagonistic gradients fine-tune signalling strength, providing new mechanistic insight into how protein dynamics control tissue patterning. We anticipate our dataset to serve as foundation for mechanistic investigations of mammalian somitogenesis including the role of mechanics and metabolism. More broadly, our approach combining microfluidics-based synchronization of signalling in multicellular systems with omics analyses can be applied to study dynamics in other contexts such as in tissue homeostasis4 and regeneration5.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

We used critical point drying (CPD) of heavy metal-stained mouse brain tissue to produce mechanically stable samples with preserved ultrastructure and enhanced refractive index boundaries, a nanofoam-like material that remains compatible with follow-up conventional resin embedding. Using two complementary synchrotron-based setups, a high-throughput microtomography beamline (P14, DESY) and a nanoscale holographic tomography beamline (ID16A, ESRF), we found that CPD samples consistently showed 2-4x stronger phase-shift signal than conventional resin-embedded tissue. The contrast gain remained consistent across samples, imaging conditions, and beamlines. Our results suggest that CPD offers a versatile route for preparing tissue for subcellular and ultrastructural-resolution X-ray imaging.

In this work, we compared five variants of the LH2 complex from genetically modified strains of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, all containing the same BChls but different Cars with increasing conjugation: zeta-carotene (N=7; LH2Zeta), neurosporene (N=9; LH2Neu), spheroidene (N=10; LH2Spher), lycopene (N=11; LH2Lyco), and spirilloxanthin (N=13; LH2Spir). Absorption measurements confirmed that Car excited state energy decreased with increasing conjugation. Similarly, fluorescence spectra showed that the B850 BChl emission peak had an increasing red shift from LH2Zeta[-&gt;](LH2Neu/LH2Spher)[-&gt;]LH2Lyco[-&gt;]LH2Spir. In contrast, time-resolved fluorescence and ultrafast transient absorption (fs-TA) revealed similar excited state lifetimes ([~]1 ns) for all complexes except LH2Spir ([~]0.7 ns). From fs-TA analysis, an additional [~]7 ps non-radiative dissipation step from B850 BChl was observed for LH2Zeta. Further, singlet-singlet and singlet-triplet annihilation studies showed a [~]50% average fluorescence lifetime reduction in LH2Zeta at high laser power and high repetition rate, compared to [~]10-15% reductions in LH2Neu/LH2Spher/LH2Lyco and minimal lifetime change in LH2Spir. In LH2Zeta, the fastest decay component (<50 ps) became prominent at high repetition rates, consistent with strong singlet-triplet annihilation. Nanosecond TA measurements revealed long-lived (>40 s) BChl triplet states in LH2Zeta and signs of damage caused by singlet oxygen, whereas other LH2s showed faster triplet quenching ([~]18 ns) by Cars. These findings highlight a key design principle of LH2 complexes: the Car triplet energy must be significantly lower than the BChl triplet energy to efficiently quench BChl triplets that otherwise act as potent ""trap states"" causing exciton annihilation in laser-based experiments or photo-damage in native membranes.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W004593/1;BB/W005719/1;BB/R000174/1;""},{""name"":""Royal Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wnrjx87"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""URFR241006;""},{""name"":""Office of Basic Energy Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mg91w61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0018097;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""564394927;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

Here we introduce EXPAND (EXplainable Pathologist Aligned Nuclear Discriminator), the first pathologist-interpretable AI model to predict breast cancer tumor subtypes and patient survival. EXPAND focuses on a core set of 12 nuclear pathologist-interpretable features (NPIFs), composing the Nottingham grading criteria used by the pathologists. It is a fully automated, end-to-end diagnostic workflow, which automatically extracts NPIFs given a patient tumor slide and uses them to predict tumor subtype and survival. EXPANDs performance is comparable to that of existing deep learning non-interpretable black box AI models. It achieves areas under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.73, 0.79 and 0.75 for predicting HER2+, HR+ and TNBC tumor subtypes, respectively, matching the performance of proprietary models that rely on substantially larger and more complex interpretable feature sets. The 12 NPIFs demonstrate strong and independent prognostic value for patient survival, underscoring their potential as biologically grounded, interpretable biomarkers for survival stratification in BC. These results lay the basis for building interpretable AI diagnostic models in other cancer indications.

Traditionally, ecological factors have been the primary focus of species distribution studies, but recent work emphasizes the importance of rapid evolution through local adaptation. Here, we focus on adaptation to changing temperatures, which is one of the central challenges populations face today. Importantly, thermal adaptation may be affected by the underlying thermodynamics. Despite many existing models in the fields of thermal biology and spatial evolutionary ecology, there is little integrative theory. However, understanding and modelling the thermodynamic constraints on thermal adaptation is likely essential for more nuanced predictions of the impacts of climate change. By integrating molecular mechanisms and population dynamics in a unified modelling framework, we here study how temperature-dependent processes at the protein level influence the macroecological patterns of range expansions. Our results highlight the importance of the microscopic processes underlying thermal adaptation for capturing the evolutionary ecology of range expansions. Specifically, the molecular bases of thermal adaptation define how and how fast thermal performance can evolve, which determines range expansion speeds. In general, our framework predicts that adaptation to warmer temperatures will be easier than adaptation to cold. Our study underscores the necessity for more interdisciplinary work, combining molecular mechanisms with population dynamics in space in order to improve climate change modeling, enhance prediction accuracy and provide better information for management and conservation of natural populations.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-19-CE02-0015;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

Yet this raises a paradox: if there is such strong selection for optimal display choreography within species, how do courtship displays diversify so extensively between species? To address this, we measure how the choreography of courtship changes among allopatric populations of the dancing dune fly - Apotropina ornatipennis Malloch (Diptera: Chloropidae) - a species in which males and females spend their days cavorting on Australias hot sandy beaches. Merging population genetics with detailed quantification of the courtship display we explore which elements of the display are the first to diverge between isolated populations, whether new behaviours arise rapidly, and whether sequence rearrangements occur in the modular structure of the display. We find that these tiny flies express courtship repertoires approaching the levels of visual complexity seen in birds of paradise. Yet despite clear genetic and geographic isolation, the complex choreography of courtship displays is stable among populations. In contrast to the notion that courtship behaviour should be highly evolvable and rapidly diverge among allopatric populations, our findings suggests that the complex choreography of courtship can instead act as a stabilising feature that limits divergence over short evolutionary timescales.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

Applied to breast cancer cells, pepR-MS identifies over 21,000 unique crosslinks at 4,757 crosslinking sites in 744 proteins. Employing different nucleases, we capture crosslinks with RNA moieties up to six nucleotides, revealing RNA crosslinking preferences at domain and subdomain resolution. Finally, we demonstrate mass spectrometry-based sequential sequencing of both peptide and RNA from the same crosslink, providing a starting point for the analysis of long-chain peptide-RNA crosslinks that map interaction interfaces across the proteome and transcriptome.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""325871075;492625837;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

However, it remains unclear whether this is intrinsically mediated or driven by age-related changes in neighboring cells. Here, we describe a scalable, genetically modifiable system for in vivo heterochronic myeloid cell replacement. We find reconstituted myeloid cells adopt region-specific transcriptional, morphological and tiling profiles characteristic of resident microglia. Young donor cells in aged brains rapidly acquired aging phenotypes, particularly in the cerebellum, while old cells in young brains adopted youthful profiles. We identified STAT1-mediated signaling as one axis controlling microglia aging, as STAT1-loss prevented aging trajectories in reconstituted cells. Spatial transcriptomics combined with cell ablation models identified rare natural killer cells as necessary drivers of interferon signaling in aged microglia. These findings establish the local environment, rather than cell-autonomous programming, as a primary driver of microglia aging phenotypes.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Cure Alzheimer‚Äôs Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

Yet the molecular basis underlying niche-specific colonization remains poorly defined. To address this, we conducted a time-resolved dual RNA-seq experiment to simultaneously monitor the transcriptional co-adaptations of human commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and human gut epithelial cells in an anaerobe-epithelium co-culture system. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of mucus-associated versus supernatant Bacteroides populations unveiled small RNAs (sRNAs) that are differentially regulated between spatially segregated subpopulations. Among these, we identified IroR as a key sRNA that facilitates B. thetaiotaomicron adaptation to the mucus-rich, iron-limiting niche, partly by modulating expression of bacterial capsule genes. This work provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of gut colonization and underscores a previously underappreciated role for bacterial sRNAs in shaping mutualistic interactions between the human microbiota and the gut epithelium.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757801175942

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.
