However, cost and invasiveness preclude EGD in those who have no prior GERD symptoms, despite having other risk factors, representing missed opportunities for BE screening in individuals who account for approximately 40% of the patients who eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate if non-endoscopic methods can enable BE detection in an at-risk population without GERD symptoms.

MethodsPatients presenting for colonoscopy who had not undergone previous EGD plus had [&ge;]3 BE risk factors (from among age >50 years, male sex, white race, smoking history, family history of BE/EAC, or central obesity) without chronic GERD symptoms were prospectively recruited for non-endoscopic screening. Trained nurses administered the EsoCheck (Lucid Diagnostics) encapsulated balloon. Samples were assayed with the EsoGuard BE detection methylated DNA marker panel (Lucid Diagnostics). Patients with a positive result were offered standard-of-care EGD, while patients with a negative EG result were offered free of cost research EGD. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and BE prevalence were calculated.

ResultsThe mean age of the 132 study subjects was 60.7 years, 129 (98%) were white, 124 (94%) were male, 71 (54%) had a prior smoking history, 46 (35%) were centrally obese, and 5 (4%) reported a family history. EsoCheck was successfully administered in 124 (94%) and the EsoGuard methylated DNA marker panel could be assayed in 120 (97%) of the samples. Thirty-four assays were positive of which 27 underwent a follow-up EGD and BE was identified in 9, PPV = 33% [17%, 54%] subjects. EGD was also performed in 22 of the 86 subjects whose assays were negative and none of them had BE, NPV = 100% [85%, 100%]. A logistic regression model fitted to impute the presence of BE estimated the PPV as 27% [13%, 44%], NPV as 98% [92%, 100%], and BE prevalence as 8.4% [4.5%, 14.3%].

ConclusionPatients without chronic GERD who have [&ge;]3 BE risk factors have a moderately high prevalence of BE. Non-endoscopic detection can effectively identify BE, enabling expansion of screening to this larger at-risk population. Those with a negative EG assay have a low likelihood of BE.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

Notably, in the past two decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, affecting individuals under the age of 50 years, has doubled in many countries. The reasons for this increase are unknown. Here, we investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related differences by examining 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries. No major differences were found in microsatellite unstable cancers, but variations in mutation burden and signatures were observed in the 802 microsatellite-stable cases. Multiple signatures, most with unknown etiologies, exhibited varying prevalence in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and Thailand, indicating geographically diverse levels of mutagenic exposure. Signatures SBS88 and ID18, caused by the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin, had higher mutation loads in countries with higher colorectal cancer incidence rates. SBS88 and ID18 were also enriched in early-onset colorectal cancers, being 3.3 times more common in individuals diagnosed before age 40 than in those over 70, and were imprinted early during colorectal cancer development. Colibactin exposure was further linked to APC driver mutations, with ID18 responsible for about 25% of APC driver indels in colibactin-positive cases. This study reveals geographic and age-related variations in colorectal cancer mutational processes, and suggests that early-life mutagenic exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria may contribute to the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

The extent to which policies impacted person-to-person contact remains unclear. In this study, we examined changes in contact patterns and their association with behaviors and governmental recommendations in Japan during the pandemic.

Ten social contact surveys were conducted between 2021 and 2023 reaching over 1500 participants per survey in Osaka and Fukuoka prefectures where governmental recommendations were first implemented due to high COVID-19 incidence. Their contact patterns were assessed through their demographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination status, and individual disease mitigation measures. Generalized linear models were used to identify factors associated with increased contacts.

The mean number of contacts during the pandemic declined by at least 49.8% (8.2 weekday contacts and 6.0 weekend contacts per individual, adjusted by age and sex) compared to a study conducted prior to 2020. Weekdays, occupation, larger household sizes, and mask wearing were associated with a higher number of contacts. The frequency and duration of contacts were negatively associated with the issuance of COVID-19 governmental measures, yet the relative change in contacts was not as prominent as pre- and post-lockdown situations in the United Kingdom.

There was a gradual increase in contacts with time and less strict public health recommendations. Yet, contacts that did not increase with uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and continuous mask wearing depict cautious behavior across the survey population during the pandemic and into 2023. These results are in contrast with European countries where contacts largely increased among vaccinated individuals compared to the non-vaccinated. Social contacts are country and context specific, highlighting the need for data collection across different communities.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that changes in circulation of common respiratory pathogens associated with the introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic altered acquisition of immunity to S. pyogenes and common respiratory viruses.

DesignCross-sectional study recruiting before (September 2016 to March 2020) and after (April 2020 to July 2023) introduction of NPIs.

SettingEuropean hospitals in 10 countries.

ParticipantsChildren with suspected infection and afebrile controls, aged 0-4 years.

Main OutcomesMolecular detection of bacterial and viral pathogens on throat swabs and age-stratified total serum IgG reactivity to S. pyogenes cell wall extract from two strains (measured by ELISA), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), five influenza viruses and four common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 measured by Mesoscale immunoassay.

ResultsThroat swabs from 1942 children under 5-years of age were tested for respiratory pathogens (1449 recruited before introduction of NPIs; 493 recruited after). A decrease in detection of S. pyogenes, RSV, common cold coronaviruses, and influenza viruses was observed between March 2020 to July 2021, corresponding to the maximal period of NPIs. Antibodies to S. pyogenes were measured in 252 children recruited before NPIs and 200 thereafter. Antibodies to viral antigens were measured in 230 before NPIs and 92 thereafter. Total IgG to S. pyogenes and RSV was significantly lower in children aged 3-4 years recruited after NPI introduction compared with before (S. pyogenes emm1: after, n=67, median 0.13 vs before, n=87, 0.35 IVIG relative-units, p=0.007. RSV: after, n=30, median 49604 vs before, n=76, 141782 mesoscale-units p<0.001). No such differences were observed for children aged 0-2 years, or for individual influenza viruses, common cold coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusions and RelevanceWe found a significant reduction in serum antibodies to S. pyogenes and RSV in children aged 3-4 years after introduction of NPIs. Equivalent to approximately a year delay in acquisition of immunity, these data provide a biological basis for the 2022-2023 upsurge in severe S. pyogenes infections in this age group.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

ParA-family ATPases exploit this nucleoid matrix to position a wide range of cargos, yet how nucleoid compaction influences these positioning reactions remains poorly understood. We previously characterized the Maintenance of Carboxysome Distribution (Mcd) system in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, where the ParA-like ATPase McdA binds the nucleoid and interacts with its partner protein, McdB, to generate dynamic gradients that distribute carboxysomes for optimal carbon fixation. Here, we investigate how nucleoid compaction impacts carboxysome positioning, particularly during metabolic dormancy when McdAB activity is downregulated. We demonstrate that a compacted nucleoid maintains carboxysome organization in the absence of active McdAB-driven positioning. This finding reveals that the nucleoid is not merely a passive substrate for positioning, but an active player in spatial organization. Given the widespread role of ParA-family ATPases in the positioning of diverse cellular cargos, our study suggests that nucleoid compaction state is a fundamental, yet underappreciated, determinant of mesoscale organization across bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1745705283444

Ecological generalism is one of the strongest predictors of survival in light of these changes which, in animals, may be shaped by bold and innovative behaviours. Species with greater habitat generalism are proposed to behave more boldly (e.g., touching and ingesting novel food). Species with greater dietary generalism are proposed to behave more innovatively (e.g., novel problem-solving to access food). Support for both hypotheses exists but remains largely restricted to broad comparisons between generalists and specialists. Further comparative data are needed to understand the extent to which these behavioural patterns might shape more nuanced ecological variation between species, such as species with finer-scale niche differences. We compared bold and innovative behaviour in two wild sympatric generalists, the Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), using a pull-string task with strings and wires attached to vertical cups containing high-value food. Although both species are broadly classified as generalists, raccoons show relatively greater habitat and dietary flexibility than opossums. Because they live sympatrically, it offers a unique opportunity to test - at the same time and locations - whether these finer-scale niche differences are reflective of differences in their bold and innovative behaviour. We predicted that raccoons would display bolder behaviour (in terms of touching our novel task) and more innovative behaviour (in terms of solving it). We found that both species were equally likely to acknowledge and touch the task, but raccoons were more likely to display innovation to access the food. Raccoons' propensity for using innovation to solve novel foraging challenges may contribute to their greater ecological flexibility compared to opossums. More broadly, our findings may help explain differences in how each species adapts to environmental changes.","NA","biorxiv",1745705283444

Their potential to transform oncological practice is significant, but their accuracy and reliability in interpreting medical imaging and offering management suggestions remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in interpreting T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI images of meningiomas and glioblastomas and providing treatment recommendations based on simulated patient inquiries.

MethodsThis observational cohort study utilized publicly available MRI datasets. Thirty cases of meningiomas and glioblastomas were randomly selected, yielding 90 images (three orthogonal planes per case). ChatGPT-4o was tasked with interpreting these images and responding to six standardized patient-simulated questions. Two neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons assessed ChatGPTs performance using five-point Likert scales and their inter-rater agreement was evaluated.

ResultsChatGPT identified MRI sequences with 91.7% accuracy and localized tumors correctly in 66.7% of cases. Tumor size was qualitatively described in 85% of cases, and the median acceptability was rated as 4.0 (IQR 4.0-5.0) by neuroradiologists. ChatGPT included meningioma in the differential diagnosis for 73.3% of meningioma cases and glioma in 83.3% of glioblastoma cases. Inter-rater agreement among neuroradiologists ranged from moderate to good ({kappa} = 0.45-0.72). While surgical treatment was suggested in all symptomatic cases, neurosurgeon acceptability ratings varied, with poor inter-rater reliability.

ConclusionsChatGPT demonstrates potential in interpreting neuro-oncological MRI images and offering preliminary management recommendations. However, errors in tumor localization and variability in recommendation acceptability underscore the need for physician oversight and further refinement of LLMs before clinical integration.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

We aimed to determine if gSOS was associated with bone health in children.

Two observational studies of children were evaluated: (1) children enrolled in the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) with genetic data (N=1,727); and (2) children with genetic data for research at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP; N=10,301).

Genetic variants were used to calculate gSOS and genetic ancestry. For the BMDCS, puberty stage, dietary calcium, physical activity and fracture accumulation (none or [&ge;]1 fracture) were self-reported, height and weight were measured and BMI calculated. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of the lumbar spine, hip, radius, and whole body were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and expressed as Z-scores. The CHOP study paired genetic data with documentation of fracture in the electronic health record (EHR).

gSOS associated with higher aBMD Z-scores across 7 skeletal sites [e.g., a 1 SD increase in gSOS associated with 0.17 (95% CI: 0.10-0.24) higher lumbar spine aBMD Z-score]. These associations were consistent for males and females, age, puberty stage, and lifestyle factors, and most consistent among children of European genetic ancestry. A 1 SD increase in gSOS associated with 12% and 16% reduced likelihood of self-reported fracture in the BMDCS (OR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.95) and a recorded fracture in the CHOP EHR (OR=0.88; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.95). No sex or genetic ancestry differences were found.

A higher gSOS score associated with higher aBMD at multiple skeletal sites and reduced odds of fracture in two independent pediatric samples. This genetic tool may have clinical utility to help enhance bone health in early life and protect against fracture across the lifespan.

Lay summaryIn adults, the polygenic risk score gSOS associates with reduced fracture risk. This study evaluates the relationship of gSOS to bone density and fractures in two groups of children. We found that a 1 standard deviation increase in gSOS was associated with higher bone density at multiple skeletal sites. In our two groups of children, a 1 standard deviation increase in gSOS associated with reduced odds of fracture in children by 12% (95% CI: 0.82, 0.95) and 26% (95% CI: 0.74, 0.95).

The first line of treatment for MDD is antidepressant medication that enhances signaling by monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine. Other treatments include non-pharmaceutical treatments, such as electroconvulsive therapy and transmagnetic stimulation, and non-traditional pharmaceutical antidepressants that function via alternative, often unknown, mechanisms. Methods: To identify mechanisms of action shared across antidepressant categories, we examined changes in gene expression following treatment with both traditional and non-traditional antidepressants, using a meta-analysis of public transcriptional profiling data from laboratory rodents (rats, mice). We focused on the hippocampus, which is a brain region that is well-documented via neuro-imaging to show morphological changes in depression that reverse with antidepressant usage. We specifically focused on treatment during adulthood, and included both clinically-used antidepressants (both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) and treatments demonstrated to effectively treat depressive mood symptoms. The outcome variable was gene expression in bulk dissected hippocampus as measured by microarray or RNA-Seq. To conduct our project, we systematically reviewed available datasets in the Gemma database of curated, reprocessed transcriptional profiling data using pre-defined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria. We identified 15 relevant studies containing a total of 22 antidepressant vs. control group comparisons (collective n=352). For each gene, a random effects meta-analysis model was then fit to the antidepressant vs. control effect sizes (Log2 Fold Changes) extracted from each study. Results: Our meta-analysis yielded stable estimates for 16,439 genes, identifying 58 genes that were consistently differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate<0.05) across antidepressant experiments and categories. Of these genes, 23 were upregulated and 35 were downregulated. The functions associated with the differentially expressed genes were diverse, including modulation of the stress response, immune regulation, neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. Conclusion: The genes that we identified as consistently differentially expressed across antidepressant categories may be worth investigating as potential linchpins for antidepressant efficacy or as targets for novel therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1745705283444

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

The molecular basis for these effects can be explored using transcriptional profiling to quantify brain gene expression. In the present report, we used a meta-analysis of public transcriptional profiling data to discover effects of SD on gene expression that are consistent across studies and paradigms. To conduct the meta-analysis, we used pre-specified search terms related to rodent SD paradigms to identify relevant studies within Gemma, a database containing >19,000 re-analyzed microarray and RNA-Seq datasets. Eight studies met our systematic inclusion/exclusion criteria, characterizing the effect of 18 SD interventions on gene expression in the mouse cerebral cortex (collective n=293). For each gene with sufficient data (n=16,290), we fit a random effects meta-analysis model to the SD effect sizes (log(2) fold changes). Our meta-analysis revealed 182 differentially expressed genes in response to SD (false discovery rate<0.05), 104 of which were upregulated and 78 downregulated. Gene-set enrichment analysis (fGSEA) revealed down-regulation in pathways related to stress response (e.g., glucocorticoid receptor, Nr3c1), cell death and neural cell differentiation, and upregulation related to hypoxia and inflammation. Exploratory analyses found that SD duration (ranging from 3-12 hrs) did not significantly influence differential expression. However, recovery sleep (RS: 2-18 hrs) was included in three studies, and reversed the impact of SD on four transcripts. Our meta-analysis illustrates the diverse molecular impact of SD on the rodent cerebral cortex, producing effects that occasionally parallel those seen in the periphery.","NA","biorxiv",1745705283444

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

Although prior studies suggest that many trait-associated loci are pleiotropic, the extent to which this pleiotropy reflects shared causal variants or confounding by linkage disequilibrium remains poorly characterized. To define a set of candidate loci with potentially pleiotropic associations, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of up to 1,167 clinically relevant traits and diseases across 1,789,365 diverse individuals genetically similar to Admixed American (AMR, NMax = 60,756), African (AFR, NMax = 128,361), East Asian (EAS, NMax = 307,465), European (EUR, NMax = 1,283,907), and South Asian (SAS, NMax = 8,876) reference populations from the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP), UK Biobank (UKB), FinnGen, Biobank Japan (BBJ), Tohoku Medical Megabank (ToMMO), and Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). We identified 27,193 genome-wide significant locus-trait pairs (1MB region with PGWAMA < 5 x 10-8) in within-population analysis and 29,139 in multi-population analysis (PMR-MEGA < 5 x 10-8). Among these, 11.5% (n = 3,149) of locus-trait pairs in population-wise and 6.4% (n = 1,875) in multi-population analyses did not reach genome-wide significance in previously published GWAS. In aggregate, the genome-wide significant loci fell within 2,624 non-overlapping autosomal genomic windows on average [~]600kb in size. Each locus contained genome-wide significant signals for a median of 6 traits (IQR 2 to 18), including 2,110 (80%) pleiotropic loci associated with >1 trait. Multi-trait colocalization identified 1,902 (72%) loci with high-confidence (posterior probability > 0.9) evidence of a shared causal variant across two or more traits. Variants in pleiotropic loci were significantly enriched for a broad spectrum of functional annotations compared to non-pleiotropic counterparts. Polygenic scores (PGS) developed from these data generally improved prediction compared to existing PGS and were broadly associated with both on- and off-target phenotypes.

MethodsWe used plasma samples collected from subjects diagnosed with MIS-C and compared them first to controls with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and then to controls with pneumonia or Kawasaki disease. We used mass spectrometry to identify proteins. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm-based classification schemes were used to analyze protein pathways. We assessed diagnostic accuracy using internal and external cross-validation.

ResultsProteomic analysis of a training dataset containing MIS-C (N=17), and asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infected control samples (N=20) identified 643 proteins, of which 101 were differentially expressed. Plasma proteins associated with inflammation and coagulation increased and those associated with lipid metabolism decreased in MIS-C relative to controls. The SVM machine learning algorithm identified a three-protein model (ORM1, AZGP1, SERPINA3) that achieved 90.0% specificity, 88.2% sensitivity, and 93.5% area under the curve (AUC) distinguishing MIS-C from controls in the training set. Performance was retained in the validation dataset utilizing MIS-C (N=17) and asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infected control samples (N=10) (90.0% specificity, 84.2% sensitivity, 87.4% AUC). We next replicated our approach to compare MIS-C with similarly presenting syndromes, such as pneumonia (N=17) and Kawasaki Disease (N=13) and found a distinct three-protein signature (VWF, SERPINA3, and FCGBP) that accurately distinguished MIS-C from the other conditions (97.5% specificity, 89.5% sensitivity, 95.6% AUC). We also developed a software tool that may be used to evaluate other protein pathway signatures using our data.

ConclusionsWe used MIS-C, a novel hyperinflammatory illness, to demonstrate that the use of mass spectrometry to identify candidate plasma proteins followed by machine learning, specifically SVM, is an efficient strategy for identifying and evaluating biomarker signatures for disease classification.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

In longer evolutionary scales, e.g. between families or orders, this diversity arises from whole-genome and tandem duplication events. Less is known about the evolutionary patterns shaping chemical diversity at shorter scales, e.g. within a family. Utilizing the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway we explored how the terminal structural modification enzyme GSL-OH evolved across the Brassicaceae and the genomic processes that control presence-absence variation of its products (R)-2-hydroxy-but-3-enyl and (S)-2-hydroxy-but-3-enyl. We implemented a phylo-functional approach where we functionally validated GSL-OH orthologs across the Brassicaceae and used that information to map the genomic origin and trajectory of the loci. This uncovered a complex mechanism involving at least three ancestral loci with extensive gene loss across all species creating unequal retention across the phylogenetic relationships. Convergent evolution in enantiomeric specificity was observed where several independent species had tandem duplicates diverged towards producing the R or S enantiomers. To explore potential biological differences between the enantiomers, we performed Trichoplusia ni insect assays and Botrytis cinerea detached leaf assays. We found that plants with the S enantiomer were more susceptible to B. cinerea infection while plants with the R enantiomer seemed more susceptible to T. ni herbivory. This variation in activity between the precursor and different enantiomeric products may shape the recurrent evolution of their production.","NA","biorxiv",1745705283444

However, the precise mechanisms driving transmission between poultry premises and the impact of potential control measures in Great Britain, such as vaccination, are not fully understood. We have developed a spatial transmission model for the spread of HPAI in poultry premises calibrated to infected premises data for the 2022--23 season using Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Identifying distinct subphenotypes and understanding potential personalized modifications remain critical unmet needs. Methods: We applied unsupervised learning techniques to electronic medical records from UCSF to identify distinct Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes based on comorbidity profiles. We conducted enrichment analyses to determine cluster-specific comorbidities. Based on the observed sex-based differences, we subsequently conducted sex-stratified analyses to assess differences in disease manifestations between males and females. Findings were validated using an independent UC-Wide dataset. Results: Among 8,363 patients, we identified five Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes, characterized by comorbidities related to cardiovascular conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, and frailty-related conditions such as pneumonia and pressure ulcers. Sex-stratified analyses revealed significant differences in comorbidity distributions across clusters. Notably, in Cluster 2, circulatory diseases were more prevalent among males, whereas in Cluster 3, bladder stones were more common among females.

Non-invasive electrophysiological biomarkers like phase amplitude coupling (PAC) hold promise for understanding and managing PD. This study aims to investigate the modulations of levodopa and locomotion in cortical and cortico-muscular beta-gamma PAC by monitoring central EEG (cEEG) and gastrocnemius EMG (gEMG) and discuss their potential utility as biomarkers for monitoring motor impairments. Methods The cEEGs and gEMGs were recorded in 30 PD patients during sitting, standing, and free walking under OFF and ON dopaminergic medication. Spectral features, cEEG and cEEG-gEMG PAC were analyzed to assess the effects of levodopa, locomotion, and their correlations with PD symptoms. Results Longer gait cycle intervals and shorter step lengths were observed OFF levodopa, correlating with UPDRS-III. The cEEG beta-gamma PAC during sitting and standing, and cEEG-gEMG beta-gamma PAC during walking, positively correlated with UPDRS-III OFF levodopa. The cEEG alpha/low beta-gamma and cEEG-gEMG low beta-gamma PAC increased during levodopa withdrawal while walking, with the latter correlating with reduced step length. Step event-related PAC analysis unveiled the enhancement of alpha/beta cEEG-gamma gEMG PAC around heel strikes in ON levodopa compared to OFF. Conclusions Elevated cEEG and cEEG-gEMG beta-gamma PAC in various locomotion are associated with Parkinsonian motor impairments, whereas cEEG-gEMG low beta-gamma PAC is linked specifically to gait dysfunction. Levodopa administration enhances the dynamic fluctuations of alpha/beta oscillations during free walking. These findings demonstrated that the cortical and cortico-muscular couplings are significantly impacted by both levodopa and locomotion status, hinting the context-dependent nature of PAC and its potential utility in the development of gait phase-locked aDBS strategies for PD patients.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

Understanding their longitudinal trajectory in the untreated state is key to their use as potential markers of pharmacodynamic response. To this end, we undertook a large-scale proteomic study in well-phenotyped cohorts to identify biomarker candidates of ALS disease state and disease progression. Methods: Clinical phenotypic data and biofluid samples, collected from patients with ALS and healthy controls through multiple longitudinal natural history studies, were used to identify biomarker candidates. SOMAmer (Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer)-based relatively quantitative measurement of ~7,000 proteins was performed in plasma and CSF, with immunoassay validation of candidates of interest. Results: We identified 329 plasma proteins significantly differentially regulated between ALS and controls (adjusted p-value <0.05), with 25 showing >40% relative abundance. PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11 had the greatest log-fold elevation, while ANTXR2 and ART3 had the greatest log-fold reduction. A similar set of plasma proteins was found to increase (e.g. PDLIM3, TNNT2, MYL11) or decrease (e.g. ANTXR2, ART3, MSTN) with disease progression. CSF proteins with the greatest log-fold elevation included NEFL, NEFH, CHIT1, CA3, MYL11 and GPNMB. These results were confirmed in an independent replication cohort.

However, the causal role of robotic assistance in sensorimotor recovery, an underlying core mechanistic feature, remains unclear. Objective: This study systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on upper-limb rehabilitation that isolated the effect of robotic assistance by comparing similar interventions differing only in presence, level, or mode of robotic assistance. Method: Three electronic bibliographic databases- PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched. Twelve RCTs were included in the qualitative synthesis, and data from eight studies (all involving stroke survivors) were meta-analysed with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (measure of impairment) as the primary outcome. The main analysis was done to assess the overall effect of robotic assistance, regardless of disease stage, assistance level and targeted limb area, whereas subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of robot-assisted therapy on chronic stroke survivors and to compare therapies focused on the shoulder-elbow versus the hand (wrist/fingers). Results: The main analyses yielded a significant positive effect size (0.462) favouring robotic assistance in impairment recovery, however with a significant heterogeneity between the studies. Subgroup analyses suggested potential benefits in chronic phase (moderate significant effect size 0.588), and similar therapy gain for shoulder-elbow and hand-specific training.

We demonstrate that the direct detection and quantification of high- and medium-copy markers, including PMMoV RNA, beta-lactamase, and carbapenemase DNA, in wastewater extracts is both feasible and accurate when benchmarked against gold-standard NAATs. Low-copy detection and monitoring daily trends of SARS-CoV-2 N RNA was achievable but was not as robust as NAATs. Due to the lower analytical sensitivity of NNS compared to NAATs and the requirement of a 18h hybridization step, NNS may not be suitable to provide early warning of incident cases to public health. However, as the scope of wastewater surveillance expands to monitor a broad range of nucleic acid-based biomarkers, the target and sample multiplexing capability of NNS, combined with reduced hands-on time and ease-of-analysis, are distinct advantages. Thus, NNS has a role to play in wastewater and environmental monitoring applications, especially for AMR surveillance.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

South Africa is unique in the region because its HIV programme is largely domestically funded, although donor funds and partnerships support key components. We estimated the epidemiological impact of ceased PEPFAR support for specific services and the costs and cost-effectiveness of the South African government (SAG) potentially taking over these services.

MethodsWe used a costed version of Thembisa, a South African HIV transmission model, to simulate four scenarios: a minimum scenario assuming intervention coverage reducing proportional to PEPFARs funding share of specific activities in 2023; a maximum scenario assuming additional health system impacts; and sub-scenarios either with 3-year recovery (2029-2031) or no recovery to previous coverage. HIV programme costs were estimated from the provider perspective (SAG) in 2024/25 US dollars.

ResultsOver 2025-2028, discontinuing PEPFAR funding in South Africa without replacement by SAG would result in 150,000-296,000 additional new HIV infections (29-56% increase) and 56,000-65,000 additional AIDS-related deaths (33-38%). Permanent discontinuation of currently PEPFAR-supported services over the next 20 years increases this to 1.1-2.1 million additional new HIV infections and 519,000-712,000 additional AIDS deaths. To sustain services, SAG needs to spend an additional $710 million to $1.5 billion between 2025 and 2028. Under a reduced budget, the most cost-effective interventions to preserve are ART and PrEP.

ConclusionUnmanaged PEPFAR exit from South Africa threatens to undo a decade of progress towards ending AIDS as a public health threat unless services are taken over by other funders, including SAG.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

Vaccination is a vital tool in preventing acute COVID-19 and may confer additional protection against Long COVID. There is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing of COVID-19 vaccination (i.e., vaccination schedule) to minimize the risk of Long COVID.

MethodsWe applied Longitudinal Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation to electronic health record (EHR) data from a retrospective cohort of patients vaccinated against COVID-19 between December 2021 and September 2022. We evaluated the association between binary COVID-19 vaccination status (two or more doses vs. zero doses) and 12-month Long COVID risk among patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 between December 2021 and September 2022. In addition, we compared the 12-month cumulative risk of Long COVID (ICD-10 code U09.9) among patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 one to three months after vaccination, three to five months after vaccination, or five to seven months after vaccination while adjusting for relevant high-dimensional baseline and time-dependent covariates.

ResultsWe analyzed EHR data from a retrospective cohort of 1,558,018 patients. In our binary cohort (n = 519,980), we found that vaccinated patients had a lower risk of Long COVID than unvaccinated patients (adjusted marginal risk ratio 0.84 (0.81, 0.88)). In our longitudinal cohort (n = 1,085,291), we did not find a significant difference in Long COVID risk comparing patients who were diagnosed with acute COVID-19 one to three months after vaccination versus patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 three to five months (adjusted marginal risk ratio 0.93 (95% CI 0.62, 1.41) or 5 to 7 months (adjusted marginal risk ratio 1.06 (95% CI 0.72, 1.56)) after vaccination.

ConclusionsWe found that COVID-19 vaccination before SARS-CoV-2 infection was protective against Long COVID, and we did not find that this protection significantly waned within 7 months after vaccination. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination protects against Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

Established theories, such as kin selection, group selection, and reciprocal altruism, explain altruism via assortment mechanisms that depend on preferential interactions among altruists to ensure a higher average payoff than selfish individuals. Hamiltons rule defines the minimum level of such assortative interactions required for altruism to evolve. However, in populations with limited growth, increased competition can erode the selective advantage of altruism and thus require more stringent Hamiltons rule. Here, we propose a fundamentally different mechanism: fluctuating selection driven by increased competition due to added social benefits of altruism in populations with limited carrying capacity. Under fluctuating selection, altruists can invade a selfish population without the need of assortment mechanisms and outcompete selfish individuals through a transient phase, even when the cost of altruism exceeds its direct benefit. Classical invasion analysis, which compares the long-term growth rates of rare altruistic mutants and resident selfish individuals, fails in our model because both strategies exhibit zero long-term growth. Instead, we show that altruism can invade when its short-term, time-averaging growth rate exceeds that of selfish individuals, which necessitates a prolonged transient phase. This invasion is enabled by payoff-regulated density dependence, which captures the dynamic interplay between payoff and density on fitness under fluctuating selection. Our findings challenge the necessity of Hamiltons rule and show that genuine altruism, with less average payoff than selfish individuals, even extremely self-sacrificial, can emerge under natural selection. This suggests that altruism may arise not from preferential interaction, but as an adaptive response to population fluctuations in constrained environments, providing an alternative paradigm for understanding the evolution of altruistic behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1745705283444

The overlap with and dissociation from domain-general executive control in the frontal lobe remains contentious. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the functional relevance of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) for semantic and executive control. Across four sessions, 24 participants received 1 Hz repetitive TMS to each region individually, dual-site TMS targeting both regions sequentially (IFG followed by pre-SMA), and sham TMS. Participants then completed semantic fluency, figural fluency, and picture-naming tasks. Stimulation of either region broadly disrupted both semantic and figural fluency, suggesting shared functionality. However, electric field modeling of the induced stimulation strength revealed distinct specializations: The left IFG was primarily associated with semantic control, as evidenced by verbal fluency deficits, while the pre-SMA played a domain-general role in executive functions, affecting non-verbal fluency and cognitive flexibility (e.g., clustering and switching during semantic fluency). Notably, only dual-site TMS impaired accuracy in figural fluency, providing unique evidence for successful compensation of executive functions through either the left IFG or pre-SMA following single-site perturbation. These findings underscore the multidimensionality of cognitive control and suggest a flexible task-dependent contribution of the IFG to control processes, either as semantic-specific or general executive resource. Furthermore, they highlight the tightly interconnected network of executive control subserved by the left IFG and pre-SMA, advancing our understanding of the neural basis of semantic and executive functions.","NA","biorxiv",1745705283444

To address this gap, we present a long-range massively parallel reporter assay (long-range MPRA), an assay allowing the measurement of hundreds of enhancers at multiple distances from a genome-integrated promoter. The long-range MPRA assay features two independent landing pads, allowing modular control over the genome-integrated promoter and enhancer libraries. We showcased the capability of long-range MPRA by testing over 300 K562 enhancers, as well as a set of enhancer combinations, at distances up to 100 kb. We found that enhancers long-range activities are primarily determined by their intrinsic strength, with strong enhancers retaining more activity over long distances, while weak enhancers rapidly lose activity. Additionally, we found that GATA1-bound enhancers are more resistant to distance-dependent loss of activity, suggesting that TF binding also modulates long-range function. Finally, testing long-range enhancer activities with three different promoters (HBE, HBG and GAPDH) revealed that long-range enhancer-promoter interactions rely on not only enhancer properties but also promoter responsiveness.","NA","biorxiv",1745705283444

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

Circulating biomarkers have the potential to identify patients with primary resistance or early progression on therapy to alter treatment course and avoid unnecessary toxicity. Unbiased multimodal proteomic profiling in blood has been underexplored due to the previously limited scalability of multiplexing technologies or cohorts lacking time-series sampling. To address this, we performed plasma proteomic profiling of >2,900 proteins and high-dimensional mass cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocytes across serial time points in 250 metastatic melanoma patients on ICB treatment. We further obtained 92 patient-matched tumor samples, which were processed for single-cell and/or bulk RNA sequencing. Proteins upregulated post-ICB were associated with inflammatory pathways involving the activation of effector immune functions. Expression of genes corresponding to these proteins was higher in immune cells involved in recruitment and tumor reactivity. Expression of genes corresponding to plasma proteins more abundant in non-responders was highest in suppressive myeloid subsets and malignant cells. We further posit the involvement of these non-responder genes in immunosuppressive and pro-tumor interactions, which we confirmed using publicly available spatial transcriptomic data. We also found that epithelial-specific proteins in the circulation of responders post-ICB correlate with patient toxicity and likely originate from healthy tissues. Together, these data represent one of the deepest peripheral biomarker studies using paired blood and tumor samples in melanoma patients treated with ICB, and begin to elucidate the complex interplay between tumors and the systemic immune response within the host.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283444

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283445

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1745705283445
