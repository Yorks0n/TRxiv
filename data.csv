Apart from technical challenges such as the sparsity and heterogeneous noise properties of these data, the crucial problem is that we know little about the potentially very complex high-dimensional structures that the data represent. Consequently, there is an urgent need for exploratory analysis methods that allow rigorous representation and visualization of the structure in the data. However, currently popular methods such as UMAP and t-SNE are unsatisfactory because they are ad hoc, stochastic, uninterpretable, and known to severely distort the structure in the data. Here we show that these challenges can be overcome by representing the data on tree structures and present Bonsai: a novel method that reconstructs the most likely tree relating any set of high-dimensional objects while rigorously accounting for heterogeneous measurement noise. We show that, in contrast to other visualization methods, distances along the Bonsai trees accurately represent true distances between the objects in high-dimensional space across many types of datasets. Moreover, Bonsai automatically regularizes measurement noise, outperforming even methods specifically designed for that purpose on tasks such as nearest-neighbor identification. By analyzing a blood cell dataset, we show that Bonsai trees not only capture known lineage relationships but also provide novel biological insights. For example, Bonsai uncovers that different subsets of NK cells derive from the myeloid and lymphoid lineage, and pinpoints genes that distinguish myeloid-NK from lymphoid-NK cells. Bonsai is free from tunable parameters and scales to datasets of hundreds of thousands of cells. The accompanying tool, Bonsai-scout, provides visualizations of the Bonsai trees and allows for interactive data exploration such as identifying subclades and their markers, visualizing features along the tree, changing the tree layout, and zooming in on substructures. Finally, application to a dataset of football statistics shows the generality of Bonsai in successfully capturing complex structures in high-dimensional data.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1746828554832

Understanding the dominance of deleterious mutations is critical as it can fundamentally impact the rate and efficiency of natural selection, the magnitude of inbreeding depression, and the prevalence and evolution of genetic diseases. Despite its inarguable importance, the dominance effects of mutations remain poorly understood in humans, primarily because existing statistical methods cannot distinguish them from the overall selective effects of mutations. In this work, we take a fundamentally different approach to infer dominance by leveraging the distribution of Neanderthal ancestry across the human genome. We show through simulations that recessive deleterious mutations lead to an increase in archaic introgressed ancestry in the absence of positive selection, contrary to what is expected when deleterious mutations are additive. Leveraging this unique pattern, we develop a machine learning classifier to infer dominance in genomic windows at a megabase resolution, trained on simulations of a human demographic model with Neanderthal introgression using fully recessive or additive mutations. Our method demonstrates robust accuracy at detecting genomic windows containing recessive deleterious mutations, with particularly high power in exon-dense regions. When applied to the non-African populations from the 1000 Genomes Project, we find that approximately 3-9% of the human genome is enriched for recessive mutations with most recessive regions shared across human populations. Furthermore, our method reveals that recessive deleterious mutations are not evenly distributed across the genome: regions enriched for recessive mutations are significantly depleted of haploinsufficient genes and runs of homozygosity, and are enriched with non-additive variants associated with complex traits. Overall, our Neanderthal ancestry-based approach reveals the presence of recessive deleterious mutations in the human genome and suggests that these mutations are found in regions containing genes associated with metabolism and immune-related traits.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1746828554832

However, the HAs of Siamese algae-eater influenza-like virus (SAEILV) and chum salmon influenza-like virus (CSILV) bind to a2,3 linked sialic acid. Furthermore, SAEILV HA binds to sialyated Lewis X, is activated by human airway enzymes and is fusogenic at a wide range of pH conditions. SAEILV NA has a highly conserved active site and a similar structure to other known NAs. We also determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the HA of a previously described virus from the same sister clade, the Wuhan spiny eel influenza virus (WSEIV). Importantly, no cross-reactive antibodies against these HAs or NAs were found in the human serum, suggesting that humans are immunologically naive to these viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

This patterning reflects the differential use, by precursors and mature OSNs, of a coherent gene expression program controlled by a spatially-varying retinoic acid gradient; this program -- which includes key transcription factors and axon guidance genes -- translates position into a spatially appropriate distribution of OR choices and aligns the epithelial map of OR identity with the glomerular map present in the olfactory bulb. These results identify a transcriptional code that distinguishes and spatially organizes the vast array of sensory channels that comprise the olfactory system.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

The package offers a range of ABC methods such as simple rejection sampling, simulation-budget-constrained rejection, and Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC). Epydemix is modular, and supports ABC-based calibration both for models defined within the package and for those developed externally. To demonstrate the computational framework capabilities, we discuss usage examples that include (i) simulating an intervention-driven model with time-varying parameters, and (ii) benchmarking calibration performance using synthetic epidemic data. We further illustrate the use of the package in a retrospective case study that includes scenario projections under alternative intervention assumptions.

However, localizing subdural electrodes in patients with brain tumors presents unique challenges due to altered neuroanatomy and the impracticality of acquiring extraoperative computed tomography (CT). To address this gap, we developed BrainTRACE, a novel MATLAB tool that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cortical vascular reconstructions, and intraoperative photography for accurate subdural electrode grid placement. Methods: Preoperative MRI, cortical photography, and subdural electrode array data were recorded from patients with diffuse glioma and brain metastasis. BrainTRACE generated three-dimensional cortical surfaces, integrated vascular reconstructions, and enabled precise placement of electrode grids. Each electrode was placed based on cortical anatomy and vascular landmarks informed by intraoperative photographs. Novice and expert-level proficiency were quantified. Results: Expert users achieved high consistency and accuracy, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.934 and a mean deviation of 4.3 mm from consensus placements. Novice users demonstrated lower reliability (ICC = 0.399) and greater variability, averaging a 16.3 mm deviation from consensus. These findings highlight the non-trivial nature of intraoperative ECoG localization, which requires neuroanatomical expertise for successful grid placement. Conclusion: BrainTRACE enables accurate localization of intraoperative ECoG electrodes in brain tumor patients. By integrating anatomical images, intraoperative photographs, and vascular mapping, the tool addresses challenges posed by tumor-induced artifacts. While requiring that users have cortical neuroanatomical expertise, BrainTRACE provides a practical tool for neurosurgical and neuroscience applications, including brain malignancy, epilepsy, and deep brain stimulation procedures.

Pathogens can rapidly evolve resistance which diminishes the impact of antimicrobial treatments. The presence of other microbes in polymicrobial infections can impact the development of antimicrobial resistance of pathogens, yet it is unclear how the interplay between the environmental structure and the presence of a polymicrobial community affect the rate of plasmid mediated antibiotic resistance evolution. This study investigates the effect of environmental structure and microbial interactions on antibiotic resistance evolution in a uropathogenic Escherichia coli. We conducted a serial transfer experiment across well-mixed and spatially structured environ-ments with increasing concentrations of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, in the presence and absence of a polymicrobial community. Our results revealed that E. coli in community context displayed parallel evolutionary trajectories, leading to higher final antibiotic tolerance, while spatial structures allowed for prolonged resistance evolution. Copy number variation of the plasmid-borne resistance locus varied significantly across the different evolutionary contexts. E. coli lineages evolved in the absence of the community, in the well-mixed isolation environ-ments demonstrated the highest copy number increases, while those in the presence of the community showed minimal changes compared to the ancestor. These findings underscore the intricate relationship between the genetic basis of resistance, the environmental structure and the microbial ecology in plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

We introduce hedonic foraging as a mechanism by which hedonic evaluation guides behaviour via iterative reward maximisation. This framework integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference, whereby expected free energy encodes wanting--the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes--while variational free energy co responds to liking--the hedonic impact of the outcome. Hedonic foraging unifies the mechanisms underlying behaviours ranging from allostasis to art appreciation, casting cognition and motivated behaviour as purposive engagement with the environment and its affordances.

Long abstractHedonic evaluation shapes behaviour across organisms. Yet, the mechanisms that transform hedonic values into motivated behaviour remain poorly understood, and key questions remain unanswered. How do habits, wanting, and liking or disliking interact to generate behaviour? Do common principles govern behaviour across species and cognitive systems, from basic survival mechanisms to complex cultural endeavours? We propose a unifying theory of motivated behaviour that integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference--a framework in which perception, action and cognition emerge from the imperative to minimise free energy. We argue that variational free energy provides a natural measure of liking and disliking, while expected free energy encodes wanting--the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes. This synthesis, which we term hedonic foraging, offers a principled explanation for how organisms navigate their environments based on pleasure-driven learning and decision-making. It posits that motivated behaviour emerges from the fundamental pursuit of maximising reward, with hedonic evaluation motivating and monitoring actions through wanting and liking mechanisms. We demonstrate that hedonic foraging captures a wide range of behaviours, from allostatic processes common to all animals to sophisticated human activities such as art appreciation and cultural exploration. Crucially, our integrative perspective fosters mutual enrichment between hedonic evaluation and active inference--two fundamental approaches to behaviour. Ultimately, hedonic foraging reinforces the view that cognition is essentially about purposive engagement in adaptive interactions with the environment and its affordances and offers a unified framework for investigating cognition and behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

MGEs are often selfish, exploiting their bacterial hosts to propagate, however they can also provide adaptive advantages through horizontal gene transfer. Gene transfer agents (GTAs), which are non-infectious domesticated prophages, represent a unique class of beneficial MGEs that facilitate bacterial gene transfer. Despite their domestication, GTAs retain phage-like features, including the requirement for host cell lysis to release particles, that may inadvertently trigger host immunity. How GTAs might avoid, subvert, or possibly adopt host immune systems to complete their life stages is poorly understood. Here, we identify a tripartite system, LypABC, that is essential for GTA-mediated cell lysis in Caulobacter crescentus. LypABC resembles caspase recruitment domain-nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (CARD-NLR) anti-phage defence systems that mediate abortive infection wherein infected cells die to prevent phage proliferation, thereby protecting the overall bacterial population. LypABC-deficient cells produce host DNA-packed GTA particles and eventually die but cannot lyse to release GTA particles. Moreover, overproduction of LypABC is highly toxic to both GTA-producing and non-producing cells, highlighting the need for strict regulation. We find that such regulation is achieved transcriptionally by a repressor, RogB, which binds the promoters of lypABC and of essential GTA activator genes, thus coupling GTA activation and host cell lysis. While traditionally considered antagonistic towards MGEs, our findings here suggest that immunity components are versatile and can be adapted to support MGEs.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

It is widely used in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, yet its efficiency and broader applicability remain limited. Here, we identify key floral stages and develop novel strategies to enhance AMT-FI-based genome editing. Using a dual-reporter system (RUBY and hygromycin resistance), we determined that flowers opened at 6 days post-inoculation (DPI) are optimal for high transformation efficiency, with nearly 100% of siliques harboring transformants. However, Agrobacterium infection induced ovule abortion, particularly in wild-type (Col-0) plants, whereas efr mutants lacking the EF-Tu receptor (EFR)-mediated pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) showed reduced ovule abortion. Notably, efr mutants exhibited more RUBY-positive ovules and significantly enhanced genome editing efficiency, despite showing no improvement in stable transformation rates. These results suggest that PTI restricts transient transformation rather than T-DNA integration. We further engineered stealth Agrobacterium strains expressing a chimeric EF-Tu for evading recognition by EFR. These GV3101-derived strains, named as AS201 and AS202, enhanced both transient transformation and genome editing efficiency without significantly altering stable transformation frequency. Remarkably, genome-edited T1 plants could be recovered based on phenotype or direct sequencing without the need for antibiotic selection when targeting flowers opened at 6 DPI. Our findings reveal EFR-mediated immunity as a key barrier to efficient transient transformation and genome editing via AMT-FI. By integrating floral stage selection, immune evasion, and Agrobacterium engineering, this study provides a practical and versatile platform to advance plant genome engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

We introduce Reinforcement Learning from eXperimental Feedback (RLXF), a general framework that aligns protein language models with experimentally measured functional objectives, drawing inspiration from the methods used to align large language models like ChatGPT. Applied across five diverse protein families, RLXF improves generation of high-functioning variants beyond pre-trained baselines. We demonstrate this with CreiLOV, an oxygen-independent fluorescent protein, where RLXF-aligned models generate sequences with significantly enhanced fluorescence, including the most fluorescent CreiLOV variants reported to date. Our results indicate that RLXF-aligned models effectively integrate the evolutionary knowledge encoded in pre-trained pLMs with experimental observations, improving the success rate of generated sequences and enabling the discovery of synergistic mutation combinations that are difficult to identify through zero-shot or evolutionary approaches. RLXF provides a scalable and accessible approach to steer generative models toward desired biochemical properties, enabling function-driven protein design beyond the limits of natural evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

Here, we identify a small RNA (svsR) encoded by the lambdoid prophage NC-SV in adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strain NC101 that confers resistance to lytic coliphages. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that NC-SV-like prophages and svsR homologs are conserved across diverse Enterobacteriaceae. Transcriptional analyses reveal that svsR represses maltodextrin transport genes, including lamB, which encodes the outer membrane maltoporin LamB--a known receptor for multiple phages. Nutrient supplementation experiments show that maltodextrin enhances phage adsorption, while glucose suppresses it, consistent with established effects of these sugars on lamB expression. In vivo, we compared wild-type NC101 and a prophage-deletion strain (NC101{Delta}NC-SV) in mice to assess the impact of NC-SV on lytic phage susceptibility. Although intestinal E. coli densities remained stable across groups, animals colonized with NC101 exhibited markedly reduced phage burdens in both the intestinal lumen and mucosa compared to mice colonized with NC101{Delta}NC-SV. This reduced phage pressure was associated with increased dissemination of NC101 to extraintestinal tissues, including the spleen and liver. Together, these findings highlight a nutrient-responsive, prophage-encoded mechanism that protects AIEC from phage predation and may promote bacterial persistence and dissemination in the inflamed gut.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

Yet, how and when heterochromatin is reconfigured to facilitate changes in cell- fate remains a key open question. Here, we address this by mapping a prevalent heterochromatic feature - genome-lamina interactions - relative to transcription in single-cells during mouse embryogenesis. We find that genome-lamina interactions remain relatively uniform between germ layers following gastrulation but are extensively reconfigured in diverse tissues during later organogenesis. Focusing on limb development, we demonstrate that genome-lamina interactions are selectively released in early multipotent progenitors at key developmental genes and their surrounding regulatory domains. This ""lamina-release"" often precedes gene expression at later developmental stages, suggesting it primes regulatory domains for future potential activation. Conversely, lamina-release coincides with chromatin opening at sites of crucial limb transcription factor binding, and so is closely intertwined with the regulatory machinery driving limb formation. Finally, we show that the boundaries of topologically-associated domains (TADs) constrain the spread of lamina-release at a limb gene locus. This ensures independent lamina dynamics between neighbouring domains. Together, our data suggest a previously unrecognised process where genome-lamina interactions are selectively released at regulatory domains to transition loci toward more permissive chromatin states, thereby potentiating cell type specific activation. Our work thus reveals how systematic heterochromatin reorganization links to developmental multipotency, providing mechanistic insights into cell-fate decisions in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

A more comprehensive understanding of structure-function relationships, including non-equilibrium conformations and transitions under force, calls for methods capable of simultaneously resolving structural and mechanical properties at the single-molecule level. To meet this need, we present a DNA nanoswitch calipers platform capable of both measuring multiple intramolecular distances and mechanically unfolding individual biomolecules along defined axes.

Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the mammalian retina have a highly stereotyped, radially symmetric dendritic arbor that is essential for their role in direction-selective circuits in the retina. We show that PTEN, the primary negative regulator of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway that is highly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, regulates SAC morphology in a cell-autonomous manner. Pten-deficient SACs show a nearly twofold increase in the number of dendritic branches, while other morphological properties remain largely unchanged. These morphological changes arise late in SAC development after dendrite development is largely complete and persist into adulthood. Mechanistically, excessive dendritic branching appears to arise from dysregulated mTOR activity. Despite this dramatic increase in dendritic branches, Pten-deficient SACs maintain a normal population number, organization of synaptic outputs, and intact direction-selectivity in the retina. Collectively, these results show that PTEN is essential for the normal development of highly stereotyped neuronal morphology.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

Leveraging single-cell genomics, we investigated the transcriptional dynamics and cis-regulatory evolution of duplicated genes in cultivated soybean (Glycine max), a species that has undergone two rounds of whole-genome duplication. Our analysis revealed extensive transcriptional divergence among these duplicated gene pairs, including dosage balanced, paralogue dominance, divergence, specialization, and widespread mono-expressed pattern. These expression divergences are correlated with sequence variation in their associated accessible chromatin regions (ACRs), where cis-regulatory elements reside. Moreover, different duplication mechanisms, including whole-genome duplication and small-scale duplication, likely give rise to distinct types of cis-regulatory variants, leading to varying effects on transcriptional divergence. To further explore the evolution of cis-regulatory elements and their impact on gene expression, we focused on gene sets in which duplicated genes are derived from two rounds of whole-genome duplication and share a common ancestral gene, as cis-regulatory elements are typically co-duplicated with genes during whole-genome duplication. Most ACRs were retained after duplication whereas a subset likely arose de novo. Both mutations in duplicated elements and the emergence of de novo evolved elements contribute to widespread expression divergence within these gene sets. We also characterized the evolution of cell-type-specific expression and cell-type-specific ACRs among these sets. Collectively, our findings highlight the important role of cis-regulatory evolution in shaping transcriptional divergence and facilitating the retention of duplicated genes, offering a high-resolution view through the lens of single-cell genomics.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

Based on this, we observed three distinct protein groups: (i) common-core proteins, expressed universally across all tissues and time points; (ii) time-/tissue-specific proteins, selectively expressed within specific temporal or spatial contexts; and (iii) time-/tissue-unique proteins, whose expression is restricted to specific points in space and time. Our analysis shows a clear gradient of network centrality, transitioning from the highly connected common-core proteins to more specialized time-/tissue-specific and unique proteins, mirroring a progressive shift in functional specificity. Further, we characterized the distinct molecular signatures of intrauterine to extrauterine life, delineating two key protein networks: the embryonic development network (EDev) and the environmental aging network (EAgi). Their network characterization and comparison highlighted specific communities within the EDev network enriched for developmental diseases, and specific EAgi communities involved in aging. This network classification allowed us to rank candidate anti-aging drugs and their molecular targets, laying the foundation for a systematic, data-driven, network-based investigation of development and aging, providing a roadmap for future research aimed at mitigating age-related diseases and promoting longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

The role of the resident microbiota in modulating S. aureus nasal colonization remains largely unclear. Using a newly assembled nasal strain collection, we demonstrate that nasal commensals can either promote or inhibit S. aureus proliferation through strain- and community-specific effects in vitro and within gnotobiotic animals. We identified nutrient-dependent interactions as a key driver of these dynamics and found that S. aureus strains auxotrophic to tyrosine rely on amino acid-providing nasal communities to thrive in the nutrient-limited environment of the nose. Large-scale screenings revealed tyrosine dependency to affect 8% of nasal S. aureus strains and to impair S. aureus colonization. Our findings uncover a crucial factor in S. aureus physiology and its interactions as a commensal nasal species, paving the way for new decolonization strategies.

To explore the possibilities and advantages of antiviral PROTACs, we have developed an antiviral PROTAC against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro) using an allosteric warhead. Here, we present the design of ten MPro degraders that were developed using pelitinib as a warhead, an allosteric binder of MPro. Among several candidates, LLP019 emerged as the most potent molecule, capable of degrading up to 90% of MPro after ectopic expression in HEK293F cells. LLP019 displayed significant antiviral activity against several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 in infected Calu3 cells. In conclusion, we show that the development of antiviral PROTACs using an allosteric warhead represents a promising antiviral strategy, expanding the range of possible target proteins and ligands.

While immediate nestling survival can easily be measured, long-term survival is more challenging to evaluate. Early-life telomere length has been suggested as a potential biomarker of future fitness prospects. To evaluate the potential impact of changes in early-life temperature, we thus experimentally increased (ca. +2.8C) and decreased (ca. -1.7C) average nestbox temperatures in wild pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) during nestling postnatal growth, and measured nestling telomere length before fledging. Shorter telomeres were observed in individuals exposed both to an experimental heating or cooling during growth.

While significant progress has been made in migratory birds, where multiple compass systems are well described, similar knowledge for migratory Lepidoptera remains limited. Most insights into butterfly and moth orientation come from just two species: the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and the Australian Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa), both of which possess multimodal compass systems involving visual and geomagnetic cues. However, these species follow unusual migratory strategies that include diapause or aestivation and multigenerational round-trip migrations between breeding region and very specific non-breeding areas, that are not representative of most other Lepidoptera migrants. In contrast, European species such as the painted lady (Vanessa cardui) and red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) undertake regular seasonal migrations involving multiple generations and no diapause, yet the sensory mechanisms guiding their orientation remain largely unexplored. Here, we report findings from a two-year study investigating compass orientation in red admirals using a flight simulator under a range of controlled light and magnetic conditions. Our experiments yielded three key results: (1) red admirals orient using solar cues when selecting migratory direction; (2) the sun compass in this species appears to be time-independent, as clock-shifted individuals did not alter orientation; and (3) there is no sign of magnetic sense in red admirals. These findings sharply contrast with those from monarch butterflies, which rely on both time-compensated sun and light-dependent magnetic compasses. Our results reveal important interspecific variation in compass use among diurnal Lepidoptera and underscore the need to expand orientation research beyond traditional model systems to better understand the diversity of migratory strategies and orientation mechanisms in migratory Lepidoptera.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

By integrating a large set of over 500 RNA binding protein (RBP) depletion and binding experiments across two cell lines generated by the ENCODE consortium, we uncovered a number of RBPs in each cell type whose depletion leads to widespread alteration of 3'UTR patterns. These include not only known regulators of APA, but also many putative novel regulators of 3'UTR isoform expression. We focused analysis on the largely unstudied DEAD box RNA helicase, DDX55, and validate its novel role in 3'UTR isoform regulation using molecular assays and targeted 3' end sequencing experiments.

Due to its high conservation, the 3CLpro is relatively stable across all these variants without significant changes, suggesting that drugs targeting this enzyme could be effective against all variant viruses. And compared to traditional antibodies, nanobodies show significant advantages against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Traditional antibodies often lose their inhibitory activity due to viral mutation. Nanobodies are characterised by their small size, high stability, high affinity for antigen binding, and high water solubility, which enable them to capture viruses quickly and effectively address the continuous mutations and persistent infections of SARS-CoV-2. In this research, we devised a strategy to produce nanobodies by utilizing a fragment-generating large language model, resulting in the identification of a nanobody named Nb01. Nb01 exhibits potent and broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The nanobody Nb01, directed against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, demonstrated efficacy against the majority of prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, it has a higher affinity than the current best performing nanobodies (S43, bn03, R14, and 3-2A2-4) for most of the variants, including the Alpha (27.5%), Gamma (29.7%), Omicron BA.2 (32.2%), BA.4/5 (81.2%), BF.7 (64.2%) and XBB (5.5%) variants. For other variants, Nb01 displayed affinities that were on par with these benchmark nanobodies. In summary, the exceptional specificity, low toxicity, robust stability, and extensive spectrum of Nb01 indicate its potential to be developed as a nanobody therapeutic for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections and its diverse variants.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

We find that while the two approaches often identify the same target genes, they also capture distinct features of gene regulation. CRISPRi tends to detect genes that are physically closer to regulatory variants and more constrained, whereas eQTL studies are sensitive to detecting multiple, often distal, genes. By comparing these discoveries to a gold-standard set of genes linked to blood traits, we demonstrate that the two approaches provide highly complementary insights with distinct strengths and caveats. Our results offer guidance for improved design of CRISPRi and eQTL studies and highlight their potential as a powerful toolkit for interpreting disease-associated loci.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

We present context-dependent identification of spatial motifs (CISM), a two-step method to identify local cell structures associated with a disease state in single cell spatial data. First, for each tissue, CISM enumerates structures of enriched reoccurring multicellular patterns that define modular 'motifs' in the multicellular network. Second, discriminative motifs are selected according to the context - their presence in patients at different clinical disease states. By applying CISM, we show that modular structures composed of as little as 3-5 cells and their relative spatial arrangement can encode differences in clinical disease states in cohorts of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and melanoma patients. Machine learning validation indicated that discriminative motifs outperform state-of-the-art methods for disease state prediction while enabling interpretation of which interactions in what spatial context are associated with these predictions.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway plays a key role in inducing cardiac hypertrophy and in regulating specific protein translation. However, it is unclear how the specificity is achieved, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of protein translation remain unexplored.

MethodsWe employed single-molecule imaging of nascent peptides (SINAPs) reporters to visualize and analyze the translation dynamics in single adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and tracked active translation sites at high spatiotemporal resolution. We also examined the effects of adrenergic stimulation and the role of the ERK pathway in translation localization.

ResultsOur findings revealed that translation sites are primarily localized near Z-lines in cardiomyocytes, with some sites being highly dynamic and moving during translation. The 3 untranslated regions did not significantly change the localization of translation. Many translation sites co-localized with microtubules, and their movement predominantly occurred along microtubular tracks. Adrenergic stimulation led to a transient shift in translation activity toward the peri-nuclear region, peaking at 12 hours and requiring ERK pathway activity for this localization change.

ConclusionsOur high-resolution single-cell study demonstrates that protein translation in cardiomyocytes is dynamic and responsive to hypertrophic stimuli in an ERK-dependent manner. The localized translation mechanism allows cardiomyocytes to rapidly adapt to changing environments by preferentially translating mRNAs in the peri-nuclear region.

These findings provide new insights into the spatial regulation of translation in cardiomyocytes and its role in cardiac hypertrophy.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554832

Lateral transfer of carbon needs to be more widely studied, especially in smaller streams and catchments, as they receive high loading of organic matter and are hotspots of carbon degradation. In this study we combined measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and quantity with microbial community data from a small Arctic catchment. Our aim was to understand how the catchment is affected by two sub-catchments, degrading palsa permafrost mire and peatland thawing in spring. The small thaw ponds in the palsa mire were clearly distinct from the rest of the catchment and ponds in the peatland. Palsa ponds had higher DOM quantity, more aromatic DOM and distinct microbial communities. Thus, our results point towards analogous and low export rates of organic matter from the permafrost mire and peatland to the receiving small streams. Instead, the DOM is being retained and metabolised within the small ponds in both palsa mire and peatland. In our study we were also able to detect high abundances of ultra-small Patescibacteria.

We found that older age was associated with a steady decline in reaction time (- 1.2 ms/year), movement time (-2.3 ms/year), and movement precision (-0.02{o}/year). Although the rate of decline did not differ by sex/gender, females consistently reacted more slowly (-8 ms), moved more slowly (-37 ms), and exhibited greater precision (+0.5{o}) across the adult lifespan. Notably, sex/gender differences attenuated after accounting for experiential factors such as video game use and the amount of sleep per day, whereas age remained a robust and consistent predictor of motor decline. Together, these findings provide a large-scale quantification of age, sex/gender, and experiential effects on motor control, offering a normative benchmark to inform future clinical interventions aimed at preserving motor function across the lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

Plasmodium malariae is a human malaria parasite that is present in most malaria-endemic regions. However, this species remains enigmatic because it is very challenging to culture, its low parasitaemia in human infections, and frequent co-infection with other malarias. We investigate the transcriptome of P. malariae during transmission in the vector by analyzing RNA-seq data from midgut and salivary gland parasite stages obtained in two experimental mosquito infections with field P. malariae isolates. Our analysis resulted in 3,699 expressed genes, of which 263 are developmentally regulated and 1,338 are P. malariae specific, including genes with unknown functions and without orthologs in other Plasmodium. We detected unique expression patterns of the ApiAP2 family of transcription factors, many of which appear to function as master regulators during sporogony. We found expressed several members of multigene families, like PIR, PHIST, fam-l, and described new families potentially showing transcriptional heterogeneity. Our findings point to the uniqueness of the P. malariae transcriptome, probably related to different transmission traits in the vector, and the lower pathogenicity and virulence in the human.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

The recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology generated large-scale genomic and/or multi-omics datasets from different disease types or models. Owing to the huge volume of data coming out of genomic experiments, scientists are facing challenges in handling, manipulating, visualizing, and interpreting the data. Currently, available tools to visualize genetic variants from VCF files are not very user-friendly as most of them require knowledge of command line tools or scripts to install and run those software. Moreover, biologists or clinicians lack this knowledge of computer programming. Therefore, graphical user interface (GUI) based tools or software are needed to effectively summarize and visualize the huge volume of genomic data such as VCF data.

MethodsWe have developed a Shiny App, interactive tool using the R programming language that utilizes other R packages like ""vcfR"" and ""maftools"" to visualize and generate quality control metrics for genetic data effectively and exquisitely. A key improvement is the addition of a user-friendly interface, providing researchers with an interactive way to explore VCF or Cancer genomics data. Our tool is powered by Shiny, making it even easier for researchers to analyze and visualize genomic variation data using a GUI. Researchers can upload their datasets and customize the analysis parameters to suit their specific research needs.

ResultsA user-friendly interactive tool has been developed for the summarization and visualization of data related to genomic variation research. The application features an easy and friendly interface, allowing users to perform various functions such as data loading, summarization, and visualization interactively. XVCF offers an easy-to-use GUI platform to read genetic variant data (annotated or unannotated) and extract useful information such as read depth, mapping quality, genotype, quality control summary, and allele frequency from unannotated data. In the second module of XVCF, the cancer genomic data (annotated, so far supported by ANNOVAR) is analyzed using ""maftools"" to produce oncoplot, comparison of mutational load across different TCGA datasets, gene summary, etc. XVCF is available for free download from https://github.com/rashidma/XVCF.

ConclusionXVCF Shiny web application can serve as a robust visualization and quality control GUI platform for the germline and cancer genomics dataset. We expect this tool will be immensely useful for researchers with less computational or technical knowledge. Being a shiny R package, XVCF can be installed across different operating systems and utilize different computer hardware configurations.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

We explore this issue using goddard (gdrd), an orphan gene essential for spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Although the Gdrd protein has maintained structural conservation across the Drosophila genus, its overall length and primary sequences, especially at its disordered termini, show substantial divergence. Using gene swaps assays that included gdrd orthologs from multiple species across different evolutionary distances, we investigated how lineage-specific evolutionary changes have affected Goddards ability to function in D. melanogaster. Our results indicate that most orthologs possess the ability to interact with axonemes and insect ring centrioles in D. melanogaster, suggesting these interactions could have been present in the orthologs common ancestor. Surprisingly, a highly divergent ortholog from D. mojavensis fully rescued fertility in goddard null D. melanogaster, indicating that the Gdrd protein at the base of the Drosophila genus was most likely fully integrated into an essential spermatogenesis pathway. However, several orthologs, including one from a more closely related species, failed to complement fertility in D. melanogaster. All of these complementation failures correlated with weaker axonemal binding. Furthermore, we noted that all tested orthologs exhibited divergent subcellular localization patterns. In parallel with these gene swap studies, we computationally analyzed each orthologs structural stability and flexibility, physicochemical properties within its intrinsically disordered regions, and amino acid sequence divergence. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated structural instability in the most closely related, non-functional ortholog, while shared motifs identified in the disordered termini correlated with functionality, notably present in D. mojavensis and D. melanogaster but absent in non-rescuing orthologs. These findings suggest that although Goddards central structure and key interactions likely existed at the base of the Drosophila genus, several orthologs have undergone consequential lineage-specific evolutionary changes.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

To address this gap, we introduce an integrated approach where we generate ultra-deep Region Capture Micro-C (RCMC) and Micro-C data specifically designed for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We developed Cleopatra, an attention-based deep learning model that takes epigenomic inputs and is pre-trained on genome-wide Micro-C data followed by fine-tuning with high-resolution RCMC data. Cleopatra accurately predicts 3D maps at sub-kilobase bin sizes and unprecedented resolution, enabling us to generate ultra-high-resolution, genome-wide 3D contact maps across four human cell types. These maps revealed cell-type-specific microcompartments and over 900,000 loops across the cell types, about half of which are cell-type-specific. Using Cleopatra maps, we observe that promoters form about a dozen loops on average, and that expression increases monotonically with the number of loops, indicating that looping is associated with higher gene expression. We further show the enhancer-promoter loops are often anchored by CTCF, and nominate new transcription factors that may regulate cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions. Overall, we establish a framework for ultra-high-resolution 3D genome mapping, providing a broadly applicable resource for gaining new insights into cell-type-specific gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

Contrary to the common assumption that PGCs directly develop into germline stem cells (GSCs), recent mammalian data and our zebrafish observations suggest a more complex picture. We hypothesized that individual PGCs contribute differentially to gonad development. To test this hypothesis, we developed two Cre-based lineage tracing systems and demonstrate that PGCs give rise to at least four distinct clone types in zebrafish. We observed no restriction in clone type localization along the anterior-posterior axis, suggesting these differences are PGC intrinsic or locally determined. Further examination of the ovarian reserve revealed functional evidence that some PGCs generate self-renewing GSCs, while others produce non-renewing progenitors that are depleted with successive matings. Collectively, our findings propose a revised model of vertebrate germline establishment with implications to reproductive lifespan. This model suggests that differentiation potential varies among PGCs, allowing individual PGCs to directly differentiate into multiple distinct germ cell types, including renewing GSCs and transient populations that contribute to an early wave of gametes.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

This study investigates the workplace support provided to people with Long COVID (PwLC) in the UK, focusing on their return-to-work (RTW) experiences. It encompasses perspectives from both PwLC and managers of PwLC. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 PwLC and two managers experienced in managing employees with LC. Thematic analysis was performed using NVivo14. Findings This qualitative research explored barriers and facilitators to supporting PwLC's RTW. LC is characterised by a wide range of mostly invisible and fluctuating symptoms and unpredictable recovery trajectories during which relapses can occur. Existing support mechanisms for RTW with LC include phased return, reduced hours, Occupational Health services, work adjustments, and government support. However, the study identified challenges in implementing these measures, such as unrealistic phased return plans, managers neglecting advice or guidance (e.g. from Occupational Health), unsuitable work adjustments and the burden of navigating government support. The financial impact of reduced hours or sick leave was one of the main reasons for returning to work. Both PwLC and managers highlighted significant gaps in knowledge, training, policy and guidance for RTW support, emphasising the need for tailored support. Managers reported limited resources and inflexible policies as main challenges, which they addressed through creative solutions. Conclusion This qualitative study highlights potential barriers, challenges and gaps in supporting PwLCs RTW. To ensure equitable access to work for PwLC, a flexible and personalised approach is crucial, given the variability in LC symptoms and recovery rates. RTW support that fails to accommodate these characteristics may exacerbate symptoms or cause relapses. A supportive work environment is essential, as LC symptoms can be invisible and concerns about stigma may prevent PwLC from communicating openly and seeking support. Lack of resources is a major barrier for managers in supporting PwLC. Effective government support can potentially fill this gap but must be well-designed and implemented to reduce the burden on applicants.","NA","medrxiv",1746828554833

RGC degeneration in injury and/or disease also occurs in a compartmentalized manner, with distinct injury responses in axonal and somatodendritic compartments. Thus, the goal of this study was to establish a novel microfluidic-based platform for the analysis of RGC compartmentalization in health and disease states. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived RGCs were seeded into microfluidics, enabling the recruitment and isolation of axons apart from the somatodendritic compartment. Initial studies explored axonal outgrowth and compartmentalization of axons and dendrites. We then compared the differential response of RGCs differentiated from hPSCs carrying the OPTN(E50K) glaucoma mutation with isogenic control RGCs in their respective axonal and somatodendritic compartments, followed by analysis of axonal transport. Further, we explored the axonal transcriptome via RNA-seq, focusing on disease-related axonal differences. Finally, we established models to uniquely orient astrocytes along the axonal compartment combined with modulation of astrocyte reactivity as a pathological feature of neurodegeneration. Overall, RGC culture within microfluidic chips allowed enhanced cell growth and maturation, including long-distance axonal projections and proper compartmentalization, while patient-specific RGCs exhibited axonal outgrowth deficits as well as decreased rate of axonal transport. Finally, the induction of astrocyte reactivity uniquely along the proximal region of RGC axons led to the onset of neurodegenerative phenotypes in RGCs. These results represent the first study to effectively recapitulate the highly compartmentalized properties of hPSC-derived RGCs in healthy and disease states, providing a more physiologically relevant in vitro model for neuronal development and degeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

This study examined age- and sex-specific differences in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular kinetics and used systems modeling to assess physiological coupling during moderate intensity exercise. We recruited adults to complete a single session of moderate intensity exercise on a recumbent stepper. Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) were continuously recorded. In 164 participants, the kinetic profiles were analyzed using mono-exponential modeling and functional data analysis. Granger causality within a subject-specific vector autoregression framework evaluated directional influence among physiological signals. Advancing age was associated with an attenuated dynamic response for MCAv, PETCO2, and HR while MAP was elevated. Older adults exhibited significantly smaller MCAv amplitude and slower time constants than young and middle-aged groups. While sex did not influence overall MCAv, MAP, or HR kinetics, men had significantly higher PETCO2 throughout exercise. Granger causality analysis revealed bidirectional coupling among MCAv, HR, MAP, and PETCO2. Prior PETCO2 levels significantly predicted MCAv while MAP had both short- and long-lag predictive effects on MCAv. MCAv also influenced subsequent changes in MAP and PETCO2, indicating feedback regulation. PETCO2 emerged as a dominant driver of MCAv, though systemic interactions reflect an integrated physiological network with multi-component feedback loops.

Despite emerging as important sensors of infection to regulate immunity and inflammation, the mechanisms by which pain-sensing nociceptor neurons can detect infections are poorly defined. Using C. elegans as a tractable model host that shares many features with mammalian systems, we investigated nociceptor function during bacterial infection.

ResultsIn vivo intracellular Ca2+ imaging of nociceptor ASH neurons revealed a drastic reduction in ASH responses to aversive stimuli in Staphylococcus aureus-infected animals compared to noninfected controls. Morphological examination showed that the ASH neurons lost integrity in the sensory processes that extend to the mouth, in a pathogen growth phase-dependent manner. Neighboring neurons did not exhibit this pathogen-induced neurodegeneration (PaIN) phenotype. Genetic analysis suggested that apoptosis, necrosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy are dispensable for the PaIN phenotype. In contrast, loss of the evolutionarily conserved stress-response transcription factor HLH-30/TFEB reduced the penetrance of ASH PaIN by about 50%. Moreover, infected animals showed defective ASH-mediated evasive behaviors, suggesting that the S. aureus- triggered drop in ASH activation and morphological degeneration are physiologically relevant.

ConclusionsCollectively, these findings reveal that nociceptor neurons lose functional and morphological integrity during infection with S. aureus, with severe consequences for animal behavior. Because S. aureus is a critical human pathogen, the induction of nociceptor PaIN may have important implications for human health.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

The neurodevelopmental disorder Pilarowski-Bjornsson syndrome (PILBOS) was initially described in females. Here, we describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of the largest PILBOS cohort to date, showing that both sexes can exhibit PILBOS features, although males are overrepresented. A mouse model carrying a human-derived Chd1 missense variant (Chd1R616Q/+) displays female-restricted phenotypes, including growth deficiency, anxiety and hypotonia. Orchiectomy unmasks a growth deficiency phenotype in male Chd1R616Q/+ mice, while testosterone rescues the phenotype in females, implicating androgens in phenotype modulation. In the gnomAD and UK Biobank databases, rare missense variants in CHD1 are overrepresented in males, supporting a male protective effect. We identify 33 additional highly constrained autosomal genes with missense variant overrepresentation in males. Our results support androgen-regulated sexual dimorphism in PILBOS and open novel avenues to understand the mechanistic basis of sexual dimorphism in other autosomal Mendelian disorders.

However, it is unclear whether a reformulation will be necessary for 2025. KP.2-based monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (KP.2 MV) were authorized for use in 2024, and they conferred substantial protection against hospitalizations caused by viral variants that emerged and dominated later, such as KP.3.1.1 and XEC. Today, LP.8.1 has become the dominant variant worldwide, particularly so in North America. To characterize the antigenicity of LP.8.1, we tested serial serum samples from 16 individuals who recently received KP.2 MV in neutralization assays against KP.3.1.1, XEC, and LP.8.1 pseudoviruses. Serum neutralizing antibody titers against LP.8.1 were comparable to those against KP.3.1.1 and XEC, indicating that LP.8.1 is antigenically similar to its predecessors. Therefore, the currently authorized KP.2 MV may not need to be updated for 2025, if the vaccine manufacturers could demonstrate comparable immunogenicity for KP.2 MV and LP.8.1-based mRNA vaccines and, of course, in the absence of an antigenically divergent SARS-CoV-2 emerging.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

The 10-minute National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT) is an objective clinical test used to assess these symptoms and direct management. There is, however, no robust literature on normative data for this test, particularly from a younger population.

AimsThe aim of this study was to produce a healthy control data set for NLT, which can be used for comparison with the patient population with health conditions.

MethodsIndividuals recruited into the study had no history or symptoms of orthostatic intolerance; autonomic dysfunction; post-infection conditions (such as long COVID); or other neurological conditions with hemodynamic instability. Participants were primarily recruited from the general population in a metropolitan city. All participants underwent a standardised NLT. Lying Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR) after 2 min of lying down supine was recorded, followed by BP and HR recordings at every minute of standing (leaning against a wall) up to 10 minutes, along with recording patient-reported symptoms at each time point.

ResultsA complete dataset was available for 112 individuals (60.7% Female, 39.3% Male). The population was 61.6% Caucasian, 8.0% Asian, 3.6% Black/Caribbean, 9.8% Mixed, and 17.0% Other; the mean age was 35.3 {+/-} 15.1, with a BMI of 24.8 {+/-} 4.0; 30.6% of individuals had a background medical condition, but none of the exclusion criteria.

During NLT, upon standing, the average change of HR was an increase of 9.89 {+/-} 8.15bpm. The sustained HR increase (HR increase sustained at two consecutive readings) was an average of 6.23 {+/-} 6.94bpm. The predominant response with BP was an increase of systolic BP, with the average initial increase being 7.55 {+/-} 10.88mmHg. None of the participants met the diagnostic criteria for symptomatic OH or PoTS during NLT.

ConclusionFor the first time in the current literature, NLT data from a relatively younger healthy population without orthostatic intolerance have been gathered. This normative data will help interpret NLT findings in younger patients with Orthostatic Intolerance better and be useful in managing dysautonomia in specific conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1746828554833

Here, we use a synthetic platform to introduce diverse promoters at defined genomic sites within the Sox2 locus and measure how these inserted promoters attenuate activity of the endogenous promoter. We find that reduction in endogenous Sox2 transcription is correlated with the strength of the inserted promoter. Transcription from the inserted promoter is required for competition, with longer transcript resulting in more competition. Furthermore, competition is dependent on the location of the inserted promoter, but independent of cohesin mediated loop extrusion. Lastly, we encounter silencing of the de novo inserted promoter by HUSH, which counteracts competition. Together, our work uncovers the rules governing promoter competition, highlights its impact on tuning gene expression levels, and suggests a role for RNA in mediating this process.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

Both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells mediate MR1 presentation within the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes (meLNs). Conversely, the type-1 MAIT cell response to the intracellular pathogen Francisella tularensis requires MR1 presentation by type-2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) within meLNs and ablation of these cells or their expression of MR1 renders animals more susceptible to the infection. Although MR1 is broadly expressed at homeostasis, A. baumannii enhances MR1 on macrophages and fibroblasts, while F. tularensis increases expression on cDC2s. These results demonstrate that microbial tropism dictates which APCs mediate MR1 presentation of metabolites, revealing alternative therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1746828554833

Underlying this variation are evolutionary forces, such as selection, that operate on changes to circuitry against a background of constraints. The interplay between selection and potentially limiting constraints determine how circuits evolve. Understanding how this process operates requires an evolutionary framework that facilitates comparative analysis of neural traits, within a clear behavioural and functional context. We leverage a large radiation of Heliconiini butterflies to examine how selection shapes the evolution of the central complex and the mushroom bodies, two integration centres in the insect brain involved in spatial navigation. Within the Heliconiini, one genus, Heliconius, performs systematic spatial foraging and navigation to exploit specific plants as a source of pollen, a novel dietary resource. Closely related genera within Heliconiini lack this dietary adaptation, and are more vagrant foragers. The evolution of increased spatial fidelity in Heliconius has led to changes in brain morphology, and in specific learning and memory profiles, over a relatively short evolutionary time scale. Here, using a dataset of 41 species, we show that in contrast to a massive expansion of the mushroom bodies, the central complex and associated visual processing areas are strongly conserved in size and general architecture. We corroborate this by characterising patterns of fine anatomical conservation, including conserved patterns in dopamine and serotonin expression. However, we also identify a divergence in the expression of a neuropeptide, Allatostatin A, in the noduli, and in the numbers of GABA-ergic ellipsoid body ring neurons and their branching in the fan-shaped body, which are essential members of the anterior compass pathway. These differences match expectations of where evolutionary adaptability might occur inside the central complex network and provide rare examples of divergence of these circuits in a shallow phylogenetic context. We conclude that due to the contrasting volumetric conservation of the central complex and the massive volumetric differences in the mushroom bodies, their circuit logics must determine distinct responses to selection associated with divergent foraging behaviours.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

Their existence leads one to wonder whether amino acid sequences are sufficiently degenerate with respect to protein folding to broadly allow arbitrary pairs of functional proteins to be overlapped. Here, we investigate this question by engineering synthetic OLGs using state-of-the-art generative models. To evaluate the approach, we first design overlapped sequences targeting two different protein families. We then encode distinct highly ordered de novo protein structures and observe surprisingly high in silico and experimental success rates. This demonstrates that the overlap constraints under the structure of the standard genetic code do not significantly restrict simultaneous accommodation of well defined 3D folds in alternative reading frames. Our work suggests that OLG sequences may be frequently accessible in nature and could be readily exploited to compress and constrain synthetic genetic circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

Blocking visual access or replacing the partner with an automated agent disrupted coordination. Causal dependencies between social gaze and pull actions revealed both gaze-dependent and gaze-independent strategies. Cooperation depended on social relationships, including dominance, kinship, and sex. Remarkably, marmosets adapted strategies based on partner identity, indicating rapid social learning and memory. Altogether, these findings show that flexible, cognitively driven cooperation extends more broadly across primates than previously recognized, informing our understanding of cooperative behaviors mechanisms and evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

Part of the difficulty arises from the enormous number of possible genotypes and the lack of understanding of the underlying phenotypic differences driving adaptation. Here, we present a computational method that takes advantage of modern high-throughput fitness measurements to learn a map from high-dimensional fitness profiles to a low-dimensional latent space in a geometry-informed manner. We demonstrate that our approach using a Riemannian Hamiltonian Variational Autoencoder (RHVAE) outperforms traditional linear dimensionality reduction techniques by capturing the nonlinear structure of the phenotype-fitness map. When applied to simulated adaptive dynamics, we show that the learned latent space retains information about the underlying adaptive phenotypic space and accurately reconstructs complex fitness landscapes. We then apply this method to a dataset of high-throughput fitness measurements of E. coli under different antibiotic pressures and demonstrate superior predictive power for out-of-sample data compared to linear approaches. Our work provides a data-driven implementation of Fishers geometric model of adaptation, transforming it from a theoretical framework into an empirically grounded approach for understanding evolutionary dynamics using modern deep learning methods.","NA","biorxiv",1746828554833

When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies, arresting the proteins in their transient configurations. However, observations have so far been limited to tens of microseconds only, due to the instability of the thin liquid film under laser irradiation. Here, we seal samples between two ultrathin, vapor-deposited silicon dioxide membranes to extend the observation window by an order of magnitude.

These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1746828554833
