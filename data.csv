However, a detailed description of the pathway from the initial assembly product (procapsid) to the mature, infectious particle (virion) has been elusive. This is due to the ""in cell"" nature of the natural process, the 2-state behavior of maturation (no detectable intermediates) in some viruses in vitro and heterogeneous populations of particle intermediates that are only partially matured in other systems. The non-enveloped, T=4, ssRNA-containing, Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (N{omega}V), is a highly accessible model system that exemplifies the maturation process of a eukaryotic virus. During maturation the particle shrinks in outer diameter from 482 Angstroms (pH 7.5) to 428 Angstroms (pH 5.0). It is possible to mimic the maturation process in vitro by lowering the pH of a population of procapsids produced in heterologous systems. Indeed, by controlling the pH in vitro it is possible to produce homogenous populations of intermediate N{omega}V virus-like particles (VLPs) that occur too fleetingly to be observed in vivo. Here we report structural models, based on cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), of five intermediates in the N{omega}V maturation process. The structures of the intermediate particles reveal unique, quaternary position-dependent trajectories and refolding of subunit N and C-terminal regions, including the formation of the autocatalytic cleavage site at N570. The detailed structures reported here, coupled with previously determined structures of the procapsids and mature particles, allows the maturation pathway to be described in detail for the first time for a eukaryotic virus.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565338

We conducted a serological survey for binding antibodies to influenza A and B viruses in goats (n=452) and sheep (n=329) in Pakistan and found high seropositive rates for the hemagglutinin (HA) of avian influenza A viruses (AIV) H5 (23.9-34.0%), H7 (13.9-37.1%), and H9 (17.0-34.7%).

Notably, we observed high reactivity to the neuraminidase of human H1N1/2009 (57.8-60.6%) and swine H3N2 (14.0-14.4%), likely due to cross-reactivity with the N1 and N2 proteins of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs, respectively. Interestingly, we also detected seropositivity against influenza B HA in both goats (7.1%) and sheep (4.6%).

However, the rate at which microbial genomes are sequenced has continued to increase, and there are now datasets in the millions, far beyond the abilities of existing alignment tools. We introduce LexicMap, a nucleotide sequence alignment tool for efficiently querying moderate length sequences (> 500 bp) such as a gene, plasmid or long read against up to millions of prokaryotic genomes. A key innovation is to construct a small set of probe k-mers (e.g. n = 40,000) which window-cover the entire database to be indexed, in the sense that every 500 bp window of every database genome contains multiple seed k-mers each with a shared prefix with one of the probes. Storing these seeds, indexed by the probes with which they agree, in a hierarchical index enables fast and low-memory variable-length seed matching, pseudoalignment, and then full alignment. We show that LexicMap is able to align with higher sensitivity than Blastn as the query divergence drops from 90% to 80% for queries [&ge;] 1 kb, and then benchmark on small (GTDB) and large (AllTheBacteria and Genbank+RefSeq) databases. We show that LexicMap achieves higher sensitivity and speed and lower memory compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Alignment of a single gene against 2.34 million prokaryotic genomes from GenBank and RefSeq takes 36 seconds (rare gene) to 15 minutes (16S rRNA gene).

While the copying function of these enzymes is well established, their ability to perform untemplated DNA synthesis is less well characterized. Here, we explore the ability of DNA polymerases to synthesize DNA fragments in the absence of template. We use long-read nanopore sequencing and real-time PCR to observe the synthesis of pools of DNA products derived from a diverse set of natural and engineered DNA polymerases across varying temperatures and buffer compositions. We detail the features of the DNA fragments generated, enrichment of select sequence motifs, and demonstrate that the sequence composition of the synthesized DNA may be altered by modifying environmental conditions. This work provides an extensive data set to better discern the process of untemplated DNA polymerase activity and may support its potential repurposing as a technology for the guided synthesis of DNA sequences on the kilobase-scale and beyond.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565338

It achieves super-resolution by physically expanding specimens. Since its introduction, ExM has undergone continuous methodological developments to enhance its resolution and labeling capabilities. However, ExM imaging often encounters sample drift during image acquisition due to the physical movement of the expanded hydrogel, posing a significant challenge for accurate image reconstruction. Despite many proposed experimental solutions to mitigate sample drift, a universal solution has yet to be established. In response to this challenge, we developed 3D-Aligner, an advanced and user-friendly image analysis tool designed to computationally correct drift in ExM images for precise three-dimensional image reconstruction and downstream quantification. We demonstrate that 3D-Aligner effectively determines and corrects drift in ExM images with different expansion rates and various fluorescently labeled biological targets, showcasing its capabilities and robustness in drift correction. Additionally, we validate the precision of 3D-Aligner by comparing drift values across different labeled targets and highlight the importance of drift correction in quantification of biological structures.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565338

Other studies, however, have called these results into question, noting that statistically indistinguishable patterns of time-varying fluctuations can be obtained by windowing synthetic time series generated from ground-truth stationary correlation structure. Recently, we developed a technique for tracking rapid (framewise) fluctuations in network connectivity over time. Here, we show that these ""edge time series"" are mathematically equivalent to interaction terms in a specific family of general linear models. We exploit this fact to further demonstrate that time-varying connectivity carries explanatory power above and beyond brain activations. This observation suggests that time-varying connectivity is likely more than a statistical artifact.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565338

However, similar models for nonhuman primate (NHP) growth are lacking. The rhesus macaque, a widely used NHP in translational neuroscience due to its similarities in brain anatomy, phylogenetics, cognitive, and social behaviors to humans, serves as an ideal NHP model. This study aimed to create normative growth charts for brain structure across the macaque lifespan, enhancing our understanding of neurodevelopment and aging, and facilitating cross-species translational research. Leveraging data from the PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) and other sources, we aggregated 1,522 MRI scans from 1,024 rhesus macaques. We mapped non-linear developmental trajectories for global and regional brain structural changes in volume, cortical thickness, and surface area over the lifespan. Our findings provided normative charts with centile scores for macaque brain structures and revealed key developmental milestones from prenatal stages to aging, highlighting both species-specific and comparable brain maturation patterns between macaques and humans. The charts offer a valuable resource for future NHP studies, particularly those with small sample sizes. Furthermore, the interactive open resource (https://interspeciesmap.childmind.org) supports cross-species comparisons to advance translational neuroscience research.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565338

This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape, in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. Surprisingly, the confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its [~]1 kb coding region.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725228565338

The total diversity of geographic radiations of many Indo-Pacific fauna is often incompletely sampled in phylogenetic studies due to the difficulty in obtaining single island endemic forms across the Pacific and the relatively poor performance of degraded DNA when using museum specimens for inference of evolutionary relationships. New methods for production and analysis of genome-wide datasets sourced from degraded DNA are facilitating insights into the complex evolutionary histories of these influential island faunas. Here, we leverage whole genome resequencing (20X average coverage) and extensive sampling of all taxonomic diversity within Todiramphus kingfishers, a rapid radiation of largely island endemic  Great Speciators. We find that whole genome datasets do not outright resolve the evolutionary relationships of this clade: four types of molecular markers (UCEs, BUSCOs, SNPs, and mtDNA) and tree building methods did not find a single well-supported and concordant species-level topology. We then uncover evidence of widespread incomplete lineage sorting and both ancient and contemporary gene flow and demonstrate how these factors contribute to conflicting evolutionary histories. Our complete taxonomic sampling allowed us to further identify a novel case of mitochondrial capture between two allopatric species, suggesting a potential historical (but since lost) hybrid zone as islands were successively colonized. Taken together, these results highlight how increased genomic and taxon sampling can reveal complex evolutionary patterns in rapid island radiations.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565338

These cell engineering tools depend on antigen sensors which are most often derived from antibodies. Advances in the de novo design of proteins have enabled the design of protein binders with the potential to target epitopes with unique properties and faster production timelines compared to antibodies. Building upon our previous work combining a de novo-designed minibinder of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with the synthetic receptor synNotch (SARSNotch), we investigated whether minibinders can be readily adapted to a diversity of cell engineering tools. We show that the Spike minibinder LCB1 easily generalizes to a next-generation proteolytic receptor SNIPR that performs similarly to our previously reported SARSNotch. LCB1-SNIPR successfully enables the detection of live SARS-CoV-2, an improvement over SARSNotch which can only detect cell-expressed Spike. To test the generalizability of minibinders to diverse applications, we tested LCB1 as an antigen sensor for a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). LCB1-CAR enabled CD8+ T cells to cytotoxically target Spike-expressing cells. We further demonstrate that two other minibinders directed against the clinically relevant epidermal growth factor receptor are able to drive CAR-dependent cytotoxicity with efficacy similar to or better than an existing antibody-based CAR.

We observed two groups of differentially regulated genes: i) with robust changes in mRNA and protein levels, and ii) with protein/RNA discordances. Many of the latter are classified as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) but have no reported antiviral activity. This suggests that IFN-dependent changes in mRNA levels do not imply antiviral function. Phosphoproteomics revealed an additional regulatory layer involving non-signalling proteins with altered phosphorylation.

We sought to overcome this challenge using the classic catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of serine hydrolases as a model system. We used RFdiffusion (1) to generate proteins housing catalytic sites of increasing complexity and varying geometry, and a newly developed ensemble generation method called ChemNet to assess active site geometry and preorganization at each step of the reaction. Experimental characterization revealed novel serine hydrolases that catalyze ester hydrolysis with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) up to 3.8 x 10*3 M-1 s-1, closely match the design models (C alpha RMSDs < 1 Angstrom), and have folds distinct from natural serine hydrolases. In silico selection of designs based on active site preorganization across the reaction coordinate considerably increased success rates, enabling identification of new catalysts in screens of as few as 20 designs. Our de novo buildup approach provides insight into the geometric determinants of catalysis that complements what can be obtained from structural and mutational studies of native enzymes (in which catalytic group geometry and active site makeup cannot be so systematically varied), and provides a roadmap for the design of industrially relevant serine hydrolases and, more generally, for designing complex enzymes that catalyze multi-step transformations.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565338

This sgRNA codes both ORF3a and E and can be detected throughout the viral life cycle in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with high copy numbers. ORF3a-E-sgRNA guides more ORF3a translation and promotes the expression of cellular ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) and the binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Single-cell sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2-infected human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) revealed that maintenance of this stable translational environment by ORF3a-E-sgRNA is important for the SARS-CoV-2 assembly and release capabilities and is also beneficial for viral evasion of host innate immunity.

However, this level of detail is typically difficult to attain in macromolecular crystallography because the diffracted intensities rapidly fade with increasing resolution. The problem cannot be circumvented by increasing the fluence as this leads to detrimental radiation damage. Previously, we demonstrated that high quality MicroED data can be obtained at low flux conditions using electron counting with direct electron detectors. The improved sensitivity and accuracy of these detectors essentially eliminate the read-out noise, such that the measurement of faint high-resolution reflections is limited by other sources of noise. Inelastic scattering is a major contributor of such noise, increasing background counts and broadening diffraction spots. Here, we demonstrate that a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved using an energy filter to largely remove the inelastically scattered electrons. This strategy resulted in sub-atomic resolution MicroED data from proteinase K crystals, enabling accurate structure modelling and the visualization of detailed features. Interestingly, filtering out the noise revealed diffuse scattering phenomena that can hold additional structural information. Our findings suggest that combining energy filtering and electron counting can provide more accurate measurements at higher resolution, providing better insights into protein function and facilitating more precise model refinement.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565338

One particularly compelling demonstration of this fact can be seen by regressing EEG responses to speech against measures of how individual words in that speech linguistically relate to their preceding context. This approach produces a so-called temporal response function that displays a centro-parietal negativity reminiscent of the classic N400 component of the event-related potential. One shortcoming of previous implementations of this approach is that they have typically assumed a linear, time-invariant relationship between the linguistic speech features and the EEG responses. In other words, the analysis typically assumes that the response has the same shape and timing for every word - and only varies (linearly) in terms of its amplitude. In the present work, we relax this assumption under the hypothesis that responses to individual words may be processed more rapidly when they are predictable. Specifically, we introduce a framework wherein the standard linear temporal response function can be modulated in terms of its amplitude, latency, and temporal scale based on the expectedness of the current and prior words. We use the proposed approach to model EEG recorded from a set of participants who listened to an audiobook narrated by a single talker, and a separate set of participants who attended to one of two concurrently presented audiobooks. We show that expected words are processed faster - evoking lower amplitude N400-like responses with earlier peaks - and that this effect is driven both by the words own predictability and the predictability of the immediately preceding word. Additional analysis suggests that this finding is not simply explained based on how quickly words can be disambiguated from their phonetic neighbors. As such, our study demonstrates that the timing and amplitude of brain responses to words in natural speech depend on their predictability. By accounting for these effects, our framework also improves the accuracy with which neural responses to natural speech can be modeled.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565338

Slow waves and sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movements and sawtooth waves during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep induce frequent low-amplitude CSF fluctuations, contributing to faster CSF dynamics during deep sleep. In contrast, arousal-related brain activities during light sleep produced infrequent large CSF changes. Furthermore, these brain oscillations during light and deep sleep recruited essentially different brain networks, with deep sleep emphasizing memory and homeostatic circuits. Thus, human deep sleep has a unique way of enabling faster CSF dynamics that are distinctive from arousal mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We experimentally tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

We examined the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to echocardiography (TTE) and electrocardiography (ECG) as a scalable strategy to quantify pre-clinical trends in ATTR-CM.

MethodsAcross age/sex-matched case-control datasets in the Yale-New Haven Health System (YNHHS) we trained deep learning models to identify ATTR-CM-specific signatures on TTE videos and ECG images (area under the curve of 0.93 and 0.91, respectively). We deployed these across all studies of individuals referred for cardiac nuclear amyloid imaging in an independent population at YNHHS and an external population from the Houston Methodist Hospitals (HMH) to define longitudinal trends in AI-defined probabilities for ATTR-CM using age/sex-adjusted linear mixed models, and describe discrimination metrics during the early pre-clinical stage.

ResultsAmong 984 participants referred for cardiac nuclear amyloid imaging at YNHHS (median age 74 years, 44.3% female) and 806 at HMH (69 years, 34.5% female), 112 (11.4%) and 174 (21.6%) tested positive for ATTR-CM, respectively. Across both cohorts and modalities, AI-defined ATTR-CM probabilities derived from 7,423 TTEs and 32,205 ECGs showed significantly faster progression rates in the years before clinical diagnosis in cases versus controls (ptime x group interaction[&le;] 0.004). In the one-to-three-year window before cardiac nuclear amyloid imaging sensitivity/specificity metrics were estimated at 86.2%/44.2% [YNHHS] vs 65.7%/65.5% [HMH] for AI-Echo, and 89.8%/40.6% [YNHHS] vs 88.5%/35.1% [HMH] for AI-ECG.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate that AI tools for echocardiographic videos and ECG images can enable scalable identification of pre-clinical ATTR-CM, flagging individuals who may benefit from risk-modifying therapies.

Interference with transcription factors can lead to counter-silencing of XS target promoters but typically requires promoter engineering. In this study, we developed a novel CRISPR/dCas-mediated counter-silencing (CRISPRcosi) approach by using nuclease-deficient dCas enzymes to counteract the Lsr2-like XS protein CgpS in Corynebacterium glutamicum or Lsr2 in Streptomyces venezuelae. Systematic in vivo reporter studies with dCas9 and dCas12a and various guide RNAs revealed effective counter-silencing of different CgpS target promoters in response to guide RNA/dCas DNA binding, independent of promoter sequence modifications. The most prominent CRISPRcosi effect was observed when targeting the CgpS nucleation site, an effect that was also seen in S. venezuelae when targeting a known Lsr2 nucleation site. Analyzing the system in strains lacking the XS protein CgpS revealed varying strengths of counteracting CRISPR interference effects based on the target position and strand. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling in sgRNA/dCas9 co-expressing wild-type strains revealed high counter-silencing specificity with minimal off-target effects. Thus, CRISPRcosi provides a promising system for the precise upregulation of XS target genes with significant potential for studying gene networks as well as for developing applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

In healthy cardiomyocytes, Cx43 is mainly located at the intercalated disk; however, Cx43 remodeling is observed in cardiac pathologies and is linked with arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death. Using a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), we previously demonstrated that Cx43 localizes to the lateral side of dystrophic cardiomyocytes, forming undocked hemichannels. {beta}-adrenergic signaling-induced cardiac stress promotes S-nitrosylation and the opening of undocked Cx43 hemichannels leading to disrupted cardiac membrane excitability and deadly arrhythmogenic behaviors. To establish the direct role of S-nitrosylated Cx43 in DMD cardiomyopathy, we generated knockin DMDmdx mice with reduced levels of S-nitrosylated Cx43, by replacing cysteine 271 with a serine in one Cx43 of the unique site for S-nitrosylation of Cx43 (DMDmdx:C271S+/-). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that cardiac Cx43 lateralization in DMDmdx:C271S+/- mice was similar to DMDmdx mice, indicating that the genetic modification did not prevent Cx43 remodeling. Upon isoproterenol treatment, DMDmdx mice displayed a higher incidence of arrhythmogenic events when compared to DMDmdx:C271S+/- mice, which more closely resemble wild-type mice. Optical mapping imaging in isolated hearts showed that DMDmdx mice displayed aberrant Ca2+ signaling and prolonged action potentials, which is restored in DMDmdx:C271S+/- mice. Isoproterenol treatment evoked severe myocardial injury in DMDmdx mice, which was significantly attenuated in DMDmdx:C271S+/- mice. Notably, DMDmdx mice treated with Gap19, a Cx43 hemichannel blocker, exhibited cardioprotection against myocardial injury. We concluded that S-nitrosylation of Cx43 proteins is a fundamental NO-mediated mechanism involved in arrhythmias and myocardial injury in DMDmdx, occurring through the opening of hemichannels following {beta}-adrenergic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Here we recorded the paths of desert ants navigating in their natural habitat under various displacement conditions. We demonstrate that ants learn continuously the routes they travel and memorize them in one trial, without the need for reward or punishment, and even if these routes are meandering and do not lead to places of interest: a concept called ""latent learning"", which is typically associated with the formation of map-like representation in vertebrates. Yet, the failure of ants to solve simple artificial navigation tasks -even with the goal being clearly visible- reveals that they relied on egocentric visual memories without map-like representation of the surrounding space.

However, the identities of RNAs whose localization is regulated by a specific RBP as well as the impacts of that RNA localization on cell function have generally remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the RBP HNRNPA2B1 acts to keep specific RNAs out of neuronal projections. Using subcellular fractionation, high-throughput sequencing, and single molecule RNA FISH, we find that hundreds of RNAs demonstrate markedly increased abundance in neurites in HNRNPA2B1 knockout cells. These RNAs often encode motor proteins and are enriched for known HNRNPA2B1 binding sites and motifs in their 3' UTRs. The speed and processivity of microtubule-based transport is impaired in these cells, specifically in their neurites. HNRNPA2B1 point mutations that increase its cytoplasmic abundance relative to wildtype lead to stronger suppression of RNA mislocalization defects than seen with wildtype HNRNPA2B1. We further find that the subcellular localizations of HNRNPA2B1 target RNAs are sensitive to perturbations of RNA decay machinery, suggesting that it is HNRNPA2B1s known role in regulating RNA stability that may explain these observations. These findings establish HNRNPA2B1 as a negative regulator of neurite RNA abundance and link the subcellular activities of motor proteins with the subcellular abundance of the RNAs that encode them.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

However, while this wealth of available data represents a significant resource for further research, the analysis of these datasets often requires significant computational skills, preventing a considerable proportion of the parasitology community from meaningfully incorporating existing single-cell data into their work. Here, we present paraCell, a novel software tool that automates the advanced analysis of published single-cell data without requiring any programming ability.

We recently reported the existence of sialoglycoRNAs, where mammalian small RNAs are covalently linked to N-glycans through the modified base acp3U and trafficked to the cell surface. However, little is currently known about the role for O-glycosylation, another major class of carbohydrate polymer modifications. Here, we use parallel genetic, enzymatic, and mass spectrometry approaches to demonstrate that O-linked glycan biosynthesis is responsible for the majority of sialoglycoRNA levels. By examining the O-glycans associated with RNA from cell lines and colon organoids we find known and previously unreported O-linked glycan structures. Further, we find that O-linked glycans released from small RNA from organoids derived from ulcerative colitis patients exhibit higher levels of sialylation than glycans from healthy organoids. Together, our work provides flexible tools to interrogate O-linked glycoRNAs (O-glycoRNA) and suggests that they may be modulated in human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

To determine how the biotic and abiotic conditions in an insectary affect the composition of the bacterial microbiome of mosquitoes we reared mosquitoes from a single cohort of eggs from one genetically homogeneous inbred Aedes aegypti colony, which were split into three batches, and transferred to each of three different insectaries located within the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Using three replicate trays per insectary, we assessed and compared the bacterial microbiome composition as mosquitoes developed from these eggs. We also characterised the microbiome of the mosquitoes food sources, measured environmental conditions over time in each climate-controlled insectary, and recorded development and survival of mosquitoes. While mosquito development was overall similar between all three insectaries, we saw differences in microbiome composition between mosquitoes from each insectary. Furthermore, bacterial input via food sources, potentially followed by selective pressure of temperature stability and range, did affect the microbiome composition. At both adult and larval stages, specific members of the mosquito microbiome were associated with particular insectaries; and the insectary with less stable and cooler conditions resulted in slower pupation rate and higher diversity of the larval microbiome. Tray and cage effects were also seen in all insectaries, with different bacterial taxa implicated between insectaries. These results highlight the necessity of considering the variability and effects of different microbiome composition even in experiments carried out in a laboratory environment starting with eggs from one batch; and highlights the impact of even minor inconsistencies in rearing conditions due to variation of temperature and humidity.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

The numerosity of recently viewed images influences our perception of the current image's numerosity: numerosity adaptation. How does numerosity adaptation affect responses to numerosity in the brain? Recent studies show both early visual responses that monotonically increase with numerosity, and later numerosity-tuned responses that peak at different (preferred) numerosities in different neural populations. We have recently shown that numerosity adaptation affects the preferred numerosity of numerosity-tuned neural populations. We have also shown that early visual monotonic responses reflect image contrast, which follows numerosity closely. Here we ask how monotonic responses in the early visual cortex are affected by adaptation to different numerosities, using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI and neural model-based analyses. FMRI response amplitudes increased monotonically with numerosity throughout the early visual field maps (V1-V3, hV4, LO1-LO2 & V3A/B). This increase in response amplitudes becomes less steep after adaptation to higher numerosities, with this effect becoming stronger through the early visual hierarchy. This suppression of responses to numerosity is consistent with perceptual effects where adaptation to high numerosities reduces the perceived numerosity. These results imply that numerosity adaptation effects in later numerosity-tuned neural populations may originate in early visual areas that respond to image contrast in the adapting image.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

First, neuronal responses are very diverse -- specific stimuli or behaviors prompt some neurons to emit many action potentials, while other neurons remain relatively silent. Second, the trial-to-trial fluctuations of neuronal response occupy a low dimensional space, owing to significant correlations between the activity of neurons. These two features define the quality of neuronal representation. We link these two aspects of population response using a recurrent circuit model and derive the following relation: the more diverse the firing rates of neurons in a population, the lower the effective dimension of population trial-to-trial covariability. This surprising prediction is tested and validated using simultaneously recorded neuronal populations from numerous brain areas in mice, non-human primates, and in the motor cortex of human participants. Using our relation we present a theory where a more diverse neuronal code leads to better fine discrimination performance from population activity. In line with this theory, we show that neuronal populations across the brain exhibit both more diverse mean responses and lower-dimensional fluctuations when the brain is in more heightened states of information processing. In sum, we present a key organizational principle of neuronal population response that is widely observed across the nervous system and acts to synergistically improve population representation.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

This study investigates how molecular crowding, specifically the size and shape of crowders like Dextran and Ficoll, modulates the conformational states and phase separation behavior of Sup35NM. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and molecular dynamics simulations, we observed that Dextran, depending on its molecular weight, induces both compaction and expansion of Sup35NM, driving phase separation at certain thresholds. Notably, rod-like Dextran crowders promote phase separation, while spherical Ficoll does not, highlighting the impact of crowder geometry on IDP behavior. Computational modelling further revealed that the crowder shape influences Sup35NM's conformational ensemble by modulating intra- and inter-domain interactions. These findings elucidate the role of crowding agents in IDP phase behavior, suggesting that cellular crowding may regulate IDP functionality through conformational control.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Despite having the most complex, segmented bacterial genome, little is known about Borrelia burgdorferi DnaA and its role in maintaining the spirochetes physiology. In this work we utilized inducible CRISPR-interference and overexpression to modulate cellular levels of DnaA to better understand this essential protein. Dysregulation of DnaA, either up or down, increased or decreased cell lengths, respectively, while also significantly slowing replication rates. Using fluorescent microscopy, we found the DnaA CRISPRi mutants had increased numbers of chromosomes with irregular spacing patterns. DnaA-depleted spirochetes also exhibited a significant defect in helical morphology. RNA-seq of the conditional mutants showed significant changes in the levels of transcripts involved with flagellar synthesis, elongation, cell division, virulence, and other functions. These findings demonstrate that the DnaA plays a commanding role in maintaining borrelial growth dynamics and protein expression, which are essential for the survival of the Lyme disease spirochete.

IMPORTANCELyme disease is the most prevalent tick-borne infection in the Northern Hemisphere. Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative spirochete bacteria, has been maintained in nature for millennia in a consistent enzootic cycle between Ixodes ticks and various small vertebrate hosts. During the ticks blood meal, B. burgdorferi substantially increases its replication rate, alters its repertoire of outer surface proteins, and disseminates into the new vertebrate host. Across eubacteria, DnaA is the master regulatory protein that initiates chromosomal replication and acts as a transcription factor to regulate specific pathways. Here, we describe the roles that B. burgdorferi DnaA has on the physiology and gene expression of this medically important pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Although most biofilms are stationary, Flavobacterium johnsoniae forms a motile spherical biofilm called a zorb, which is propelled by its base cells and contains a polysaccharide core. Here, we report formation of spatially organized, motile, multispecies biofilms, designated ""co-zorbs,"" that are distinguished by a core-shell structure. F. johnsoniae forms zorbs whose cells collect other bacterial species and transport them to the zorb core, forming a co-zorb. Live imaging revealed that co-zorbs also form in zebrafish, thereby demonstrating a new type of bacterial movement in vivo. This discovery opens new avenues for understanding community behaviors, the role of biofilms in bulk bacterial transport, and collective strategies for microbial success in various environments.

Significance StatementThis paper reports the discovery of co-zorbs, which are spherical aggregates of bacteria that move and transport other bacteria. Zorbs move toward other bacteria and collect them in a manner reminiscent of phagocytes. Once inside the zorb, the new species form a striking, organized core. The discovery of co-zorbs introduces an entirely new type of bacterial movement and transport involving cooperation among bacterial species. Co-zorbs have potential for engineering microbial systems for biotechnology applications and for managing spread of bacterial pathogens in their hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Here, we utilized comparative genome-resolved metagenomics of a high-quality Illumina-sequenced sample from the Cauquenes copper tailing in central Chile. We investigate the metabolic roles and evolutionary behaviors of the resident microorganisms, focusing on capacities related to copper, iron, and sulfur metabolism. We recovered 44 medium and high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), primarily classified belonging to phylum Actinobacteriota (21), Proteobacteria (10), and Acidobacteriota (6). These MAGs were compared to the Global Soil MAGs project (SMAG catalog), which includes bacteria from conventional or natural ecosystems, to uncover specialized properties of mining bacteria. Notably, we discovered a new phylum, Nitrospirota_A, and provided insights into the unexplored taxonomic classifications at the lowest ranks such as genus and species. Functional potential analysis revealed that the mining community has enhanced molecular capabilities associated with sulfur and copper metabolism. Evolutionary analysis revealed that mining genes involved in targeted metabolism are under strong negative selection, indicating conservative evolutionary pressure within the mining environment. In particular, it was possible to identify a MAG from the genus Acidithrix with a global dN/dS ratio greater than 1, suggesting positive selection. Additionally, core proteins essential for bacterial survival, such as flagellar motors, cell cycle regulators, and biogenesis proteins, were also under positive selection. The latter points to the need for enhanced mobility in these microorganisms to locate resources efficiently. We demonstrate that copper mining communities are diverse and possess a significant metabolic repertoire under extreme conditions in sulfur and copper proteins. Those specialized genes appear to be in a conservative state rather than undergoing adaptive evolution. This study enhances our understanding of extremophile mining microbiomes, highlighting their high variability in classification, metabolic functions, evolution, and adaptation, which can be leveraged for further biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

However, when gene expression is affected jointly by time and cellular identity, analyzing such data --- including conducting cell type annotation and modeling cell type--dependent dynamics --- becomes challenging. To address this problem, we propose SNOW (SiNgle cell flOW map), a deep learning algorithm to deconvolve single cell time series data into time--dependent and time--independent contributions. SNOW has a number of advantages. First, it enables cell type annotation based on the time--independent dimensions. Second, it yields a probabilistic model that can be used to discriminate between biological temporal variation and batch effects contaminating individual timepoints, and provides an approach to mitigate batch effects. Finally, it is capable of projecting cells forward and backward in time, yielding time series at the individual cell level. This enables gene expression dynamics to be studied without the need for clustering or pseudobulking, which can be error prone and result in information loss. We describe our probabilistic framework in detail and demonstrate SNOW using data from three distinct time course scRNA-seq studies. Our results show that SNOW is able to construct biologically meaningful latent spaces, remove batch effects, and generate realistic time--series at the single--cell level. By way of example, we illustrate how the latter may be used to enhance the detection of cell type--specific circadian gene expression rhythms, and may be readily extended to other time--series analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), extracellular glutamate levels increase, contributing to excitotoxicity, circuit dysfunction, and morbidity. Increased neuronal glutamate release and compromised astrocyte-mediated uptake contribute to elevated glutamate, but the mechanistic and spatiotemporal underpinnings of these changes are not well established. Using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI and iGluSnFR glutamate imaging, we quantified extracellular glutamate dynamics after injury. Three days post-injury, glutamate release was increased, and glutamate uptake and GLT-1 expression were reduced. 7- and 14-days post-injury, glutamate dynamics were comparable between sham and CCI animals. Changes in peak glutamate response were unique to specific cortical layers and proximity to injury. This was likely driven by increases in glutamate release, which was spatially heterogenous, rather than reduced uptake, which was spatially uniform. The astrocyte K+ channel, Kir4.1, regulates activity-dependent slowing of glutamate uptake. Surprisingly, Kir4.1 was unchanged after CCI and accordingly, activity-dependent slowing of glutamate uptake was unaltered.

Recently, the high-resolution structure of a purified human caveolin assembly, the CAV1-8S complex, revealed a unique organization of 11 protomers arranged in a tightly packed, radially symmetric spiral disc. One face and the outer rim of this disc are highly hydrophobic, suggesting that the complex incorporates into membranes by displacing hundreds of lipids from one leaflet. The feasibility of this unique molecular architecture and its biophysical and functional consequences are currently unknown. Using Langmuir film balance measurements, we find that CAV1-8S is highly surface active and intercalates into lipid monolayers. Molecular simulations of biomimetic bilayers support this 'leaflet replacement' model and reveal that while CAV1-8S effectively displaces phospholipids from one bilayer leaflet, it accumulates 40-70 cholesterol molecules into a disordered monolayer between the complex and its distal lipid leaflet. We find that CAV1-8S preferentially associates with positively curved membrane surfaces due to its influence on the conformations of distal leaflet lipids, and that these effects laterally sort lipids of the distal leaflet. Large-scale simulations of multiple caveolin assemblies confirmed their association with large, positively curved membrane morphologies, consistent with the shape of caveolae. Further, association with curved membranes regulates the exposure of caveolin residues implicated in protein-protein interactions. Altogether, the unique structure of CAV1-8S imparts unusual modes of membrane interaction with implications for membrane organization, morphology, and physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Here, we investigated the contribution of rare coding variants to DDs by analyzing 13,452 individuals with DDs, 18,613 of their family members, and 3,943 controls using a combination of family-based and case/control analyses. In line with previous studies of other neuropsychiatric traits, we found a significant burden of rare (allele frequency < 1x10-5) predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) and damaging missense variants, the vast majority of which are inherited from apparently unaffected parents. These predominantly inherited burdens are strongest in DD-associated genes or those intolerant of pLoF variation in the general population, however we estimate that ~10% of the excess of these variants in DD cases is found within the DD-associated genes, implying many more risk loci are yet to be identified. We found similar, but attenuated, burdens when comparing the unaffected parents of individuals with DDs to controls, indicating that parents have elevated risk of DDs due to these rare variants, which are overtransmitted to their affected children. We estimate that 6-8.5% of the population attributable risk for DDs are due to rare pLoF variants in those genes intolerant of pLoF variation in the general population. Finally, we apply a Bayesian framework to combine evidence from these analyses of rare, mostly-inherited variants with prior de novo mutation burden analyses to highlight an additional 25 candidate DD-associated genes for further follow up.","NA","medrxiv",1725228565339

In zebrafish, these two ribosome types are expressed from different genomic loci and also differ in their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence. To characterize this dual ribosome system further, we examined the expression patterns of maternal and somatic rRNAs during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. We found that maternal rRNAs are not only expressed during oogenesis but are continuously produced in the zebrafish germline. Proteomic analyses of maternal and somatic ribosomes unveiled differences in core ribosomal protein composition. Most nucleotide differences between maternal and somatic rRNAs are located in the flexible, structurally not resolved expansion segments. Our in vivo data demonstrated that both maternal and somatic ribosomes can be translationally active in the embryo. Using transgenically tagged maternal or somatic ribosome subunits, we experimentally confirm the presence of hybrid 80S ribosomes composed of 40S and 60S subunits from both origins and demonstrate the preferential in vivo association of maternal ribosomes with germline-specific transcripts.

The regulation of flagellin levels in bacteria is governed by a tripartite regulatory network involving fliC, fliW, and csrA, which creates a feedback system to regulate flagella production. Through genomic analysis of C. difficile clade 5 strains (non-motile), we identified they have jettisoned many of the genes required for flagellum biosynthesis yet retain the major flagellin gene fliC and regulatory gene fliW. We therefore investigated the roles of fliC, fliW, and csrA in the clade 5 ribotype 078 strain C. difficile 1015, which lacks flagella and is non-motile. Analysis of mutations in fliC, fliW, and csrA (and all combinations) on C. difficile pathogenesis indicated that FliW plays a central role in C. difficile virulence as animals infected with strains carrying a deletion of fliW showed decreased survival and increased disease severity. These in vivo findings were supported by in vitro studies showing that mutations impacting the activity of FliW showed increased toxin production. We further identified that FliW can interact with the toxin positive regulator TcdR, indicating that modulation of toxin production via FliW occurs by sequestering TcdR from activating toxin transcription. Furthermore, disruption of the fliC-fliW-csrA network results in significant changes in carbon source utilization and sporulation. This work highlights that key proteins involved in flagellar biosynthesis retain their regulatory roles in C. difficile pathogenesis and physiology independent of their functions in motility.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Here, we establish a method for labeling the differentiating neurons of specific birthdates. Using this method, we traced the four-day differentiation process of in vivo deep-layer excitatory neurons in mouse embryonic cortex and examined the changes in the genome-wide transcription pattern and chromatin accessibility with RNA-seq and DNase-seq, respectively. The genomic regions of genes associated with mature neuron functions, such as deep layer-specific genes and genes responsive to external stimuli, became open even in the embryonic stage.

The conserved transcriptional repressor SP140 inhibits interferon beta (Ifnb1) expression via an unknown mechanism. We find that SP140 does not repress Ifnb1 transcription but instead negatively regulates Ifnb1 mRNA stability by directly repressing the expression of a previously uncharacterized regulator we call RESIST (REgulated Stimulator of Interferon via Stabilization of Transcript, previously annotated as Annexin-2 Receptor). RESIST promotes Ifnb1 mRNA stability by counteracting Ifnb1 mRNA destabilization mediated by the Tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. SP140 localizes within nuclear bodies, punctate structures that play important roles in silencing DNA virus gene expression in the nucleus. Consistent with this observation, we found that SP140 inhibits replication of the gammaherpesvirus MHV68. The antiviral activity of SP140 was independent of its ability to regulate Ifnb1. Our results establish dual antiviral and interferon regulatory functions for SP140 and identify the SP140-RESIST pathway as a novel regulator of Ifnb1 mRNA stability.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Understanding drought responses in plants at a cellular level is a crucial first step towards engineering improved drought resilience. However, the molecular responses to drought are complex as they depend on multiple factors including the severity of drought, the profiled organ, its developmental stage or even the cell types therein. Thus, deciphering the transcriptional responses to drought is specially challenging. Here, we investigated tissue-specific responses to mild drought in young Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) leaves using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). To preserve transcriptional integrity during cell isolation, we inhibited RNA synthesis using the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, demonstrating the benefits of transcriptome fixation for studying mild stress responses at single-cell level. We present a curated and validated single-cell atlas comprising 50,797 high-quality cells from almost all known cell types present in the leaf. We show that the mesophyll contains two spatially separated cell populations with distinct responses to drought: one enriched in canonical abscisic acid-related drought-responsive genes, and another one depicting iron starvation responses. Our study thus reveals a dual adaptive mechanism of the leaf mesophyll in response to mild drought and provides a valuable resource for future research on stress responses.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Here, we uncover dynamic expression of Hes1, a direct NOTCH target3, in intestinal stem and progenitor cells, and investigate its role in vivo and in vitro. A knock-in reporter4 reveals distinct, cell-specific period lengths in Hes1 oscillations that form a gradient along the crypt-villus axis. Whereas secretory precursors oscillate at low periods, absorptive precursors oscillate at higher periods before transitioning to a differentiated state. To test the function of different oscillation periods, we innovated a microfluidic system that modulates Hes1 oscillations in organoids.

Unlike many cancers, gliomas rarely metastasize outside the brain, indicating a possible dependency on unique features of brain microenvironment. Synapses between neurons and glioma cells exist, suggesting that glioma cells rely on neuronal inputs and synaptic signaling for proliferation. Yet, the locations and properties of neurons that innervate gliomas have remained elusive. In this study, we utilized transsynaptic tracing with a pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus to specifically infect TVA and glycoprotein-expressing human glioblastoma cells in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, allowing us to identify the neurons that form synapses onto the gliomas. Comprehensive whole-brain mapping revealed that these glioma-innervating neurons (GINs) consistently arise at brain regions, including diverse neuromodulatory centers and specific cortical layers, known to project to the glioma locations. Molecular profiling revealed that these long-range cortical GINs are predominantly glutamatergic, and subsets express both glutamatergic and GABAergic markers, whereas local striatal GINs are largely GABAergic. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that while GINs share passive intrinsic properties with cortex-innervating neurons, their action potential waveforms are altered. Our study introduces a novel method for identifying and mapping GINs and reveals their consistent integration into existing location-dependent neuronal network involving diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. The observed intrinsic electrophysiological differences in GINs lay the groundwork for future investigations into how these alterations may correspond with the postsynaptic characteristics of glioma cells.

SignificanceWe have developed a novel system utilizing rabies virus-based monosynaptic tracing to directly visualize neurons that synapse onto human glioma cells implanted in mouse brain. This approach enables the mapping and quantitative analysis of these glioma-innervating neurons (GINs) in the entire mouse brain and overcomes previous barriers of molecular and electrophysiological analysis of these neurons due to the inability to identify them. Our findings indicate that GINs integrate into existing neural networks in a location-specific manner. Long-range GINs are mostly glutamatergic, with a subset expressing both glutamatergic and GABAergic markers and local striatal GINs are GABAergic, highlighting a complex neuromodulatory profile. Additionally, GINs exhibit unique action potential characteristics, distinct from similarly selected neurons in non-tumor-bearing brains. This study provides new insights into neuronal adaptations in response to forming putative synapses onto glioma, elucidating the intricate synaptic relationship between GINs and gliomas.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

RNA activity, involving both catalytic (ribozymes) and translation processes, is controlled via myriad mechanisms involving different binding partners such as proteins and smaller polar solutes. We previously reported that lipid membranes can directly interact with the artificial R3C ribozyme, changing its activity; however, the effect of lipids on naturally occurring ribozymes remains unknown. Here, we report that both catalytic activity and RNA integrity can be controlled by the presence of different lipid membranes. Lipid gel membranes decreased the activity of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and increased the hammerhead (HH) ribozyme reaction yield. The presence of lipid liquid membrane lattices triggered RNA degradation, with greater degradation occurring in the single-stranded regions of RNA. The interplay between RNA activity and stability in the presence of different lipid membranes introduces multiple possibilities, where different combinations of ribozyme and lipid membrane composition could produce different effects on activity. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that the activity of both natural and artificial RNAs can be modulated by lipid membranes, which, in turn, contribute to the development of novel riboswitch-like molecules and lipid membrane-based RNA-biosensors.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

The non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) of SARS-CoV-2, in complex with nsp10, catalyses the final step of viral mRNA capping via its 2-O-methylase activity. This function helps the virus evade host immunity and protect viral mRNA from degradation. Current literature has not thoroughly investigated the host factors that regulate nsp16. Although various E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their specific roles in targeting nsp16 for degradation have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that nsp16 is ubiquitinated and degraded by host E3 ubiquitin ligases UBR5 and MARCHF7, acting through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). UBR5 and MARCHF7 induce nsp16 degradation via K48- and K27-linked ubiquitination, respectively. Moreover, this degradation by either UBR5 or MARCHF7 is independent, and both processes inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro as well as in vivo. Further, UBR5 and MARCHF7 exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral potential by degrading nsp16 variants from different SARS-CoV-2 strains. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of the UPS in antagonising SARS-CoV-2 replication and open new avenues for therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

This study aims to determine cost-saving risk thresholds for statin use in Germany to inform better prescription practices and healthcare policies.

MethodsA decision-analytic approach was employed, using secondary data to compare statin use with no statin use from the perspective of German sickness fund insurees. The analysis focused on cost savings from avoided cardiovascular (CV) events, translating these avoided events into net savings after accounting for treatment costs and potential side effects. The study considered the German adult population insured by sickness funds and used a lifetime horizon for the analysis.

ResultsThe maximum number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve cost savings over 10 years was found to be 40, leading to a minimum risk threshold for savings of 9.8%. It was estimated that approximately 22% of the adult population in Germany has a 10-year CV risk of [&ge;]9.8%, potentially avoiding between 307,049 and 705,537 CV events over 10 years, with net population savings of approximately {euro}18 billion.

ConclusionsThe current official threshold for statin prescription in Germany, set at a 20% 10-year risk, is too stringent. Lowering the threshold to 9.8% could significantly increase the number of patients benefiting from statin therapy, reducing CV events and generating substantial cost savings. These findings suggest that adjustments to prescription guidelines could improve cardiovascular outcomes and economic efficiency within the German healthcare system.","NA","medrxiv",1725228565339

Determining the origin time of genes facilitates the elucidation of crucial genetic mechanisms underlying significant biological evolutionary questions such as the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life, the emergence of mammals, the origin of humans, as well as the development of species- or lineage-specific traits. However, accurately determining the origin time of these genes in species separated by long evolutionary distances remains a major challenge in bioinformatics as these genes often undergo significant changes in their genome sequences, making it difficult to trace them back to their origin. Here, we proposed a new approach for dating gene age based on the micro- and macro-synteny algorithms. This approach employs the parallel computation of orthologous genome alignments across multiple species. Our method was integrated into the GageTracker (Gene Age Tracker) software, providing a fast and accurate way to trace gene age with minimal user input, available at https://github.com/RiversDong/GageTracker. Benchmarked against the simMammals dataset (Alignathon), GageTracker achieved the same high-quality genome alignments as the optimized LastZ aligner, but improved operation speed by 1.4-7 times. In a separate analysis of 12 Drosophila genomes, GageTracker efficiently assessed the ages of 23,720 genes (including ~13,965 protein-coding genes) in just ~22 hours with default parameters. When comparing with the GenTree database (recognized as the most comprehensive and accurate tool for evaluating gene age), GageTracker achieved an impressive ~94.4% accuracy and ~99% macro consistency in assessing the age of protein-coding genes. Moreover, for the ~5.6% conflicting genes, GageTracker displayed slightly higher support rates than GenTree, as evidenced by data from OrthoDB, FlyBase, and Ensembl ortholog databases. Notably, younger genes identified by GageTracker exhibited a preferential expression pattern in the testis, further reinforcing the reliability of GageTracker in accurately tracing gene age.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

For example, p53 deficiency in some mice has been shown to rescue premature aging while others display significant aging phenotype when p53-deficient. This study seeks to elucidate, structurally and mechanistically, p53s roles in longevity. Through a relative evolutionary scoring (RES) algorithm, we quantify the level of evolutionary change in the residues of p53 across organisms of varying average lifespans in six taxonomic orders. Secondly, we used PEPPI to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53-or p53-linked proteins-and known senescence-regulating proteins across organisms in the orders Primates and Perciformes. Our RES algorithm found variations in the alignments within and across orders, suggesting that mechanisms of p53-mediated regulation of longevity may vary. PEPPI results suggest that longer-lived species may have evolved to regulate induction and inhibition of cellular senescence better than their shorter-lived counterparts. With experimental verification, these predictions could help elucidate the mechanisms of p53-mediated cellular senescence, ultimately clarifying our understanding of p53s connection to aging in a multiple-species context.

Author summaryThe p53 tumor suppressor protein protects our genome from cancers by repairing DNA damage, regulating cell death and/or pushing cells to a state where they become permanently unable to divide (known as cellular senescence). An accumulation of senescent cells produces various molecular features of aging in both mouse and human cellular models-thus linking p53 to the aging process. However, the molecular mechanism by which p53 regulates aging and its structural implications on this regulation are not clear. In this study, we assessed quantitatively the evolutionary differences in p53 sequences of organisms across several taxonomical orders to determine if there is a relationship between average lifespan and sequence evolution. In addition, we used a protein-protein interaction tool to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53, or p53-associated protein, and various senescence-associated proteins across organisms of various lifespans in two taxonomic orders: Primates and Perciformes. An elucidation of p53 structural difference and mechanistic proteomic network linked to p53 regulation of cellular senescence could advance therapeutics targeting abnormal aging.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

We examined whether this extended to alterations in circadian rhythms and sleep, such as those induced by chronic social defeat stress, using actigraphy and wireless EEG. CFA-induced inflammatory pain profoundly altered sleep architecture in male and female mice. Injection of the hind paw, whether with CFA or saline, reduced some measures of circadian rhythmicity such as variance, period, and amplitude. CFA increased sleep duration primarily in the dark phase, while sleep bout length was decreased in the light and increased in the dark phase. Additionally, CFA reduced wake bout length, especially during the dark phase. Increases in REM and SWS duration and bouts were most significant in the dark phase, regardless of whether CFA had been injected at its onset or 12 hours prior. Taken together, these results indicate that inflammatory pain acutely promotes but also fragments sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

A tradeoff between these objectives is well-documented in microbes, where it is caused by the need to partition the total cellular protein content between growth- and survival-enhancing proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of growth-survival tradeoffs in multicellular animals remain largely unknown. Here, we addressed this mechanism for C. elegans by measuring the dynamic changes of its proteome during starvation using live imaging and proteomics. We found that starved animals catabolize ribosomal proteins through autophagy, which provides essential energy for survival while preserving organismal integrity. However, the resulting decline in ribosomes delayed growth resumption upon refeeding until pre-starvation ribosome levels were restored. Genetic inhibition of ribosomal autophagy had a dual effect: although it accelerated growth after short starvation, it compromised survival during prolonged starvation. These findings reveal the rate of ribosomal catabolism as a key determinant of a tradeoff between starvation survival and rapid growth resumption whose tuning may adapt animals to different starvation durations. Our research shows how the need to balance protein allocation between growth and survival constrains animal physiology, highlighting the mechanistic role of proteome resource limitation in whole-organism tradeoffs.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Acquisition is typically mediated by mobile genetic elements (MGEs), however, beyond plasmids, bacteriophages and certain integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), the nature and diversity of MGEs is poorly understood. The bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 was propagated by serial transfer in the presence of filtrate obtained from garden compost communities. Genome sequencing of derived colonies revealed acquisition of three different mobile elements, each integrated immediately downstream of tmRNA. All are flanked by direct repeats and harbour a tyrosine integrase (intY), followed by a cargo of accessory genes including putative phage defence systems. Although characteristic of genomic islands, MGE-classifiers showed no matches to mobile elements. Interrogation of DNA sequence databases showed that similar elements are widespread in the genus Pseudomonas and beyond, with Vibrio Pathogenicity Island-1 (VPI-1) from V. cholerae being a notable example. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate frequent transfer among diverse hosts. With focus on a single 55 kb element (I55) we show that intY is necessary for excision and circularisation, that the element is incapable of autonomous horizontal transfer, but is mobilizable - in the absence of direct cell-cell contact - upon addition of community filtrate. Further analyses demonstrate that I55 enhances host fitness in the presence of community filtrate, which stems in part from ability to defend against phages.

Significance StatementThe impact of horizontal gene transfer on the evolution of bacteria outpaces that driven by spontaneous mutation, but knowledge of the range of mediators, the genes mobilised, and the mechanisms of movement have largely depended on inferences stemming from bioinformatics. Here we describe a real-time evolution experiment in which a single focal strain propagated with filtrate from a complex microbial community captures genetic elements carrying a diverse cargo of genes whose mobility was previously unknown. The elements are representative of a class of mobile DNA that depend on nothing other than a tyrosine integrase that targets a highly conserved gene. The elements encode phage resistance, require the integrase to excise from the genome, confer a significant fitness advantage, and depend on a secondary element for transfer.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

This includes the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and the enzymes necessary for building the glycocalyx, the sugar coat surrounding the cells. Notably, proper glycocalyx assembly is required for spermatozoa immune evasion during fertilization. Accordingly, targeting LISRR activates immune responses and re-sensitizes to ICB in co-culture models, ex vivo in patient explants, and in vivo in humanized patient-derived models.

We observed subtelomeric fold structures that facilitate interactions amongst heterochromatinized genes involved in antigenic variation. In addition, we identified long-range intra- and interchromosomal interactions amongst active, stage-specific genes. Both structures are mediated by AP2-P, an ApiAP2 transcription factor, and a putative MORC chromatin remodeler, and functional specificity is achieved via combinatorial binding with other sequence-specific DNA-binding factors. This study provides unprecedented insight into the organizational machinery used by this medically important eukaryotic parasite to spatially coordinate genes underlying antigenic variation and to co-activate stage-specific genes.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

The plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase facilitates both cell wall remodelling and turgor pressure changes, by acidifying the apoplast of cells, referred to as acid growth. The acid growth theory is mostly established on the auxin-induced activation of PM H+-ATPase in non-photosynthetic tissues. However, how PM H+-ATPase affect the growth in photosynthetic tissues of Arabidopsis remains unclear. Here, a combination of transcriptomics and cis-regulatory element analysis was conducted to identify the impact of PM H+-ATPase on global transcript levels and the molecular mechanism downstream of the PM H+-ATPase. The PM H+-ATPase activation increased transcript levels globally, especially cell wall modification-related genes. The transcript level changes were in PM H+-ATPase-dependent manner. Involvement of Ca2+ was suggested as CAMTA motif was enriched in the promoter of PM H+-ATPase-induced genes and cytosolic Ca2+ elevated upon PM H+-ATPase activation. PM H+-ATPase activation in photosynthetic tissues promotes the expression of cell wall modification enzymes and shoot growth, adding a novel perspective of photosynthesis-dependent PM H+-ATPase activation in photosynthetic tissues to the acid growth theory that has primarily based on findings from non-photosynthetic tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

These price caps may reduce revenue for the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that negotiate the actual price paid for medicines in the US. To offset the resulting pressure on their profit margins, it is possible that PBMs would, in turn, increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines with capped prices. The model presented here evaluates how such increased out-of-pocket costs for the anticoagulants Eliquis (apixaban) and Xarelto (rivaroxaban) could impact patients financially and clinically.

MethodsCopay distributions for all 2023 prescription fills for Eliquis and Xarelto managed by the three largest PBMs were used to approximate current copay costs. Increased out-of-pocket costs were modeled as a shift of all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest copay tier. The known linear relationship between copay costs and treatment abandonment was used to calculate the potential resulting increase in treatment abandonment. Known rates of morbidity and mortality due to abandoning anticoagulants were used to estimate resulting increases in morbidity and mortality.

ResultsIf the three largest PBMs all shifted costs onto patients by moving all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest formulary tier, Tier 6, patients copay amount would increase by $235 to $482 million for Eliquis and $105 to $206 million for Xarelto. Such an increase could lead to 169,000 to 228,000 patients abandoning Eliquis and 71,000 to 93,000 abandoning Xarelto. The resulting morbidity and mortality could include up to an additional 145,000 major cardiovascular events and up to 97,000 more deaths.

ConclusionThe Medicare Price Negotiation Program could impact patients negatively if it causes PBMs to increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines. Policymakers should closely monitor changes in overall affordability, including all patient out-of-pocket expenditures, for medications in the program. Preemptive measures to ensure that the most vulnerable citizens are not placed in precarious situations leading to poorer health outcomes should be considered.","NA","medrxiv",1725228565339

The permeability characteristics of the membrane determined several key functions of this network by determining which compounds could enter the compartment and which compounds could not. One key feature of known life is the utilisation of right-handed D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars and left-handed L- amino acid stereochemical isomers (enantiomers), however, it is not clear why life adopted this specific chirality. We previously demonstrated that an archaeal and an intermediate membrane mimic, bearing a mixture of bacterial and archaeal lipid characteristics (a  hybrid membrane), display increased permeability compared to bacterial-like membranes. Here, we investigate if these membranes can drive stereochemical selection on pentose sugars, hexose sugars and amino acids. Using permeability assays of homogenous unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that both membranes select for D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars while the hybrid membrane uniquely selects for a reduced alphabet of L- facing amino acids. This repertoire includes alanine, the plausible first L- amino acid utilised. We conclude such compartments could provide stereochemical compound selection thereby demonstrating a solution to the chirality problem during the evolution of life.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

T cells, in particular, leverage their unique T cell receptors (TCRs) to detect specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-presented peptides. TCR activation is then relayed via linker for activation of T cells (LAT), a TCR-proximal disordered adapter protein, which organizes protein partners and mediates the propagation of signals down diverse pathways including NFAT and AP-1. Here, we studied how balanced downstream pathway activation is encoded in the amino acid sequence of LAT. To comprehensively profile the sequence-function relationship of LAT, we developed a pooled, single-cell, high-content screening approach in which a large series of mutants in the LAT protein were analyzed to characterize their effects on T cell activation. Measuring epigenetic, transcriptomic, and cell surface protein dynamics of single cells harboring distinct LAT mutants, we found functional regions spanning over 40% of the LAT amino acid sequence. Conserved sequence motifs for protein interactions along with charge distribution are critical sequence features, and contribute to interpretation of human genetic variation in LAT. While mutant defect severity spans from moderate to complete loss of function, nearly all defective mutants, irrespective of their position in LAT, confer balanced defects across all downstream pathways. To understand the molecular basis for this observation, we performed proximal protein labeling which demonstrated that disruption of LAT interaction with a single partner protein indirectly disrupts other partner interactions, likely through the dual roles of these proteins as effectors of downstream pathways and bridging factors between LAT molecules. Overall, we report widely distributed functional regions throughout a disordered adapter and a precise physical organization of LAT and interacting molecules which constrains signaling outputs. More broadly, we describe an approach for interrogating sequence-function relationships for proteins with complex activities across regulatory layers of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

However, a common confusion lies in equating the protein structure prediction problem with the protein folding problem. The former provides a static structure, while the latter explains the dynamic folding pathway to that structure. We challenge the current status quo and advocate that AF2 has indeed learned some protein folding prin- ciples, despite being designed for structure prediction. AF2s high-dimensional parameters encode an imperfect biophysical scoring function. Typically, AF2 uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to guide the search within a narrow re- gion of its learned surface. In our study, we operate AF2 without MSAs or initial templates, forcing it to sample its entire energy landscape -- more akin to an ab initio approach. Among over 7,000 proteins, a fraction fold using sequence alone, highlighting the smoothness of AF2s learned energy surface. Additionally, by combining recycling and iterative predictions, we discover multiple AF2 interme- diate structures in good agreement with known experimental data. AF2 appears to follow a ""local first, global later"" folding mechanism. For designed proteins with more optimized local interactions, AF2s energy landscape is too smooth to detect intermediates even when it should. Our current work sheds new light on what AF2 has learned and opens exciting possibilities to advance our understanding of protein folding and for experimental discovery of folding intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1725228565339

Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations.

The quantitative assessment indicated that 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in bears, cattle, dolphins, and foxes show higher human adaptive potential than other hosts. Also, H5N1 infections in mammals across time showed a unique set of adaptations in the 2.3.4.4b clade compared to previously circulating strains, especially the acquisition of Q591 adaptation in PB2 that enables human adaptation. Thus, 2.3.4.4b H5N1 acquires human adaptations due to natural selection pressure in non-human mammals.

We aimed to evaluate the evolution of extreme publishing behavior across countries and scientific fields during 2000-2022. Extreme publishing behavior was defined as having >60 full articles (original articles, reviews, conference papers) in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 authors with extreme publishing behavior across science excluding Physics and 12,624 such authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of extreme publishing authors in the past, in 2022 extreme publishing authors was almost as numerous in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of extreme publishing authors, followed by the USA. The largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 (5-19-fold) occurred in Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, India, Italy, Russia, Pakistan, and South Korea. Excluding Physics, most extreme publishing authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases (>6-fold) were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry, Biology, and Mathematics and Statistics.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725228565339
