We meticulously describe the cardiovascular outcomes in five patients, encompassing a range of severe conditions such as sudden cardiac death during exercise, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, acute inferior myocardial infarction, and acute myocarditis. All five patients were diagnosed with myocarditis, confirmed through endomyocardial biopsy and histochemical staining, which identified inflammatory cell infiltration in their heart tissue. Crucially, electron microscopy revealed widespread mitochondrial vacuolations and the presence of myofilament degradation within the cardiomyocytes of these patients. These findings were mirrored in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, suggesting a potential underlying cellular mechanism for the cardiac effects associated with Long COVID. Our report sheds light on the cardiovascular implications of Long COVID and underscores the importance of further research to understand its cellular underpinnings.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670033

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) afflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD. To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of healthy sedentary individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in healthy sedentary individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals. Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise. For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology. Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention. Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that healthy sedentary individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions. Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

Recent evidence suggests that pathological changes in skeletal muscle may contribute significantly to ongoing pain and fatigue, particularly post-exertional malaise. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PASC-related fatigue by examining skeletal muscle function and circulating factors in affected individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of patients with fatigue-associated PASC who had experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and content in PASC participants compared to healthy controls. This lower respiratory capacity was accompanied by markedly elevated circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (sIL2R), a T cell-specific receptor. In vitro experiments demonstrated that sIL2R directly impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces mitochondrial complex III subunit protein levels in cultured muscle cells. These findings suggest a mechanism linking systemic immune dysregulation to muscle-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC. This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of PASC identifying sIL2R as a promising therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial deficits in PASC-related fatigue and opening avenues for developing targeted interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670033

We identified 168 genomes of symbionts and lichen-associated microbes within a lichen thallus, including representatives of green algae, three different classes of fungi, and 14 bacterial phyla. By analyzing occurrence of individual species across lichen thalli from diverse environments, we defined both substrate-specific and core microbial components of the lichen. Meta-transcriptomic analysis of the principal fungal symbiont from three different developmental stages of a lichen, compared to axenically grown fungus, revealed differential gene expression profiles indicative of lichen-specific transporter functions, specific cell signalling, transcriptional regulation and secondary metabolic capacity. Putative immunity-related proteins and lichen-specific structurally conserved secreted proteins resembling fungal pathogen effectors were also identified, consistent with a role for immunity modulation in lichen morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

Here we reveal in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that two distinct oscillatory systems for the phytohormone auxin coordinate the spatial and temporal identity of PBS, jointly defining the lateral root density. We followed auxin signalling dynamics for days and thereby detected a systemic auxin signal oscillating in the mature primary root, which is distinct from the previously described root clock at the root tip. While the root clock spatially primes the PBS in the growing root tip, the systemic oscillatory auxin signal temporally controls the auxin-dependent identity of these PBS. Light perception in the shoot defines the strength of the systemic auxin signal and thereby controls the auxin-reliant ability of PBSs to develop into lateral roots. Moreover, PHYB and CRY1 mediate the light-dependent integration of other environmental signals, such as ambient temperature, into the control systemic auxin signalling and lateral root density. Our work reveals how two spatially distinct oscillatory auxin signals define the plasticity of plant root development in response to fluctuating conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

Key to this are activation domains, which often fall within disordered regions of transcription factors and recruit co-activators to initiate transcription. These interactions are difficult to characterize via most experimental techniques because they are typically weak and transient. Consequently, we know very little about whether these interactions are promiscuous or specific, the mechanisms of binding, and how these interactions tune the strength of gene activation. To address these questions, we developed a microfluidic platform for expression and purification of hundreds of activation domains in parallel followed by direct measurement of co-activator binding affinities (STAMMPPING, for Simultaneous Trapping of Affinity Measurements via a Microfluidic Protein-Protein INteraction Generator). By applying STAMMPPING to quantify direct interactions between eight co-activators and 204 human activation domains (>1,500 Kds), we provide the first quantitative map of these interactions and reveal 334 novel binding pairs. We find that the metazoan-specific co-activator P300 directly binds >100 activation domains, potentially explaining its widespread recruitment across the genome to influence transcriptional activation. Despite sharing similar molecular properties (e.g. enrichment of negative and hydrophobic residues), activation domains utilize distinct biophysical properties to recruit certain co-activator domains. Co-activator domain affinity and occupancy are well-predicted by analytical models that account for multivalency, and in vitro affinities quantitatively predict activation in cells with an ultrasensitive response. Not only do our results demonstrate the ability to measure affinities between even weak protein-protein interactions in high throughput, but they also provide a necessary resource of over 1,500 activation domain/co-activator affinities which lays the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of transcriptional activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

The histone modifications generated by the HBO1 complex are frequently absent or reduced in human lung adenocarcinomas. The HBO1 and MLL1 complexes regulate chromatin accessibility of shared genomic regions, lineage fidelity and the expression of canonical tumor suppressor genes.

However, it is not known whether anatomical ultra-low-field neuroimaging can be used to extract quantitative measures of brain morphometry, and to what extent such measures correspond to high-field MRI. Here we scanned 23 healthy adults aged 20-69 years on two identical 64 mT systems and a 3 T system, using T1w and T2w scans across a range of (64 mT) resolutions. We segmented brain images into 4 global tissue types and 98 local structures, and systematically evaluated between-scanner reliability of 64 mT morphometry and correspondence to 3 T measurements, using correlations of tissue volume and Dice spatial overlap of segmentations. We report high 64 mT reliability and correspondence to 3 T across 64 mT scan contrasts and resolutions, with highest performance shown by combining three T2w scans with low through-plane resolution into a single higher-resolution scan using multi-resolution registration.

Our findings suggest the recent bovine isolate possesses enhanced respiratory and neuroinvasive/neurovirulent properties causing fatal respiratory and neurologic disease in C57BL/6J mice.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

Thus far, only a limited number of Clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized, and they are not representative across different regions and time periods.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17/26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 423/603 (70.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to Clade I, among which 17 were Clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (95%) of the new strains fall within previously described Clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among Clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows multiple virus lineages being present within a large urban center.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic in DRC is predominated by zoonotic spillover events involving Clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the Clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670033

Contractile forces generated by myosin motor proteins mediate these mechanical signal transduction processes through unclear protein structural mechanisms. Here, we show that myosin forces elicit structural changes in actin filaments (F-actin) that modulate binding by the mechanosensitive adhesion protein -catenin. Using correlative cryo-fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, we identify F-actin featuring domains of nanoscale oscillating curvature at cytoskeleton-adhesion interfaces enriched in zyxin, a marker of actin-myosin generated traction forces. We next introduce a reconstitution system for visualizing F-actin in the presence of myosin forces with cryo-electron microscopy, which reveals morphologically similar superhelical F-actin spirals. In simulations, transient forces mimicking tugging and release of filaments by motors produce spirals, supporting a mechanistic link to myosins ATPase mechanochemical cycle. Three-dimensional reconstruction of spirals uncovers extensive asymmetric remodeling of F-actins helical lattice. This is recognized by -catenin, which cooperatively binds along individual strands, preferentially engaging interfaces featuring extended inter-subunit distances while simultaneously suppressing rotational deviations to regularize the lattice. Collectively, we find that myosin forces can deform F-actin, generating a conformational landscape that is detected and reciprocally modulated by a mechanosensitive protein, providing a direct structural glimpse at active force transduction through the cytoskeleton.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

High-accuracy, long-read sequencing can substantially improve SV characterization when coupled with effective calling methods. While state-of the-art long-read SV callers are highly accurate, further improvements are achievable by systematically modeling local haplotypes during SV discovery and genotyping. Results We describe sawfish, an SV caller for mapped high-quality long reads incorporating systematic SV haplotype modeling to improve accuracy and resolution. Assessment against the draft Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) SV benchmark from the T2T-HG002-Q100 diploid assembly shows that sawfish has the highest accuracy among state-of-the-art long-read SV callers across every tested SV size group. Additionally, sawfish maintains the highest accuracy at every tested depth level from 10 to 32-fold coverage, such that other callers required at least 30-fold coverage to match sawfish accuracy at 15-fold coverage. Sawfish also shows the highest accuracy in the GIAB challenging medically relevant genes benchmark, demonstrating improvements in both comprehensive and medically relevant contexts. When joint-genotyping 10 samples from CEPH-1463, sawfish has over 9000 more pedigree-concordant calls than other state-of-the-art SV callers, with the highest proportion of concordant SVs (78%) as well. Sawfish's quality model can be used to select for an even higher proportion of concordant SVs (86%), while still calling over 5000 more pedigree-concordant SVs than other callers. These results demonstrate that sawfish improves on the state-of-the-art for long-read SV calling accuracy across both individual and joint-sample analyses.

This slicing drives post-transcriptional gene-silencing pathways that are essential for many eukaryotes and the basis for new clinical therapies. Despite this importance, structural information on eukaryotic AGOs in a fully paired, slicing-competent conformation--hypothesized to be intrinsically unstable--has been lacking. Here we present the cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of a human AGO-guide complex bound to a fully paired target, revealing structural rearrangements that enable this conformation. Critically, the N domain of AGO rotates to allow the RNA full access to the central channel and forms contacts that license rapid slicing. Moreover, a conserved loop in the PIWI domain secures the RNA near the active site to enhance slicing rate and specificity. These results explain how AGO accommodates targets possessing the pairing specificity typically observed in biological and clinical slicing substrates.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

Using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuromelanin imaging, and pupillometry, we show that arousal and locus coeruleus (LC) activation transform otherwise continuous experiences into distinct episodic memories. As sequences unfold, encountering a context shift, or event boundary, triggers arousal and LC processes that predict later memory separation. Boundaries furthermore promote temporal pattern separation within left hippocampal dentate gyrus, which correlates with heightened LC responses to those same transition points. We also find that a neurochemical index of prolonged LC activation correlates with diminished arousal responses at boundaries, suggesting a connection between elevated LC output and impaired event processing. These findings align with the idea that arousal processes initiate a neural and memory reset in response to significant changes, constructing the very episodes that define everyday memory.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

We characterised phenotypic changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in three age groups: newborn (cord blood), adults aged 20-30 years, and adults aged 70-80 years, focusing on innate-like T cells and innate cells, including MAIT cells, NKT cells, {gamma}{delta} T cells, ILCs, and Natural Killer (NK) cells.

However, naturally occurring AAV serotypes are limited in their ability to target skeletal muscle, an important gene therapy target for many neuromuscular disorders. This means that high doses of AAV are often required to achieve therapeutically effective doses in muscle. To overcome this, novel AAV vector capsids have been engineered by inserting targeting peptides into the AAV9 capsid variable region VIII (VRIII) to achieve greater muscle transduction efficiency. Here we describe investigation of a newly reported capsid, called MyoAAV1A combined with clinically validated muscle-specific promoters. We profiled the efficiency of in vivo delivery to murine skeletal muscle and found that the optimal combination of MyoAAV1A capsid with MHCK7 promoter maintains transgene expression in skeletal muscle, and reduces expression in off-target tissues, particularly the liver. This highlights a promising capsid-promoter combination to progress in further preclinical research for skeletal muscle gene therapy.

Each of the two genomes were broken up into 100-kB segments, each of which was searched for matches to a large set of porcine queries. All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome. Results: In scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds). MSMRs for the human and bonobo X chromosomes did not significantly differ.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

However, the behavior and neural representation of ambivalent feelings, particularly during awe, remain elusive. To address this gap, we combined awe-inducing virtual reality clips, electroencephalogram, and a deep learning-based dimensionality reduction technique (N = 43). Behaviorally, awe ratings were precisely predicted by the duration and intensity of ambivalent feelings, not by single valence metrics. In the electrophysiological analysis, we identified participant- and clip-specific latent neural spaces sharing valence representation structures across individuals and stimuli. In these spaces, ambivalent feelings during awe were distinctly represented, and the variability in their distinctiveness specifically predicted awe ratings. Additionally, frontal delta oscillations mainly engaged in differentiating valence representations. Our findings demonstrate that awe is fundamentally an ambivalent experience reflected in both behavior and distinct patterns of electrophysiological activity. This work provides a new framework for understanding complex emotions and their neural underpinnings, with potential implications for affective neuroscience and mental health research.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

We evaluate key evidence relating to the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill that was discussed in the UK Parliament between 2022 and 2024. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as ""trophy hunting"" is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether such hunting provides, or potentially provides, benefits for species and/or people. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e. individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {+/-} 66.53 (mean {+/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {+/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species are stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the species or subspecies imported to the UK, but likely or possibly represents a local threat to some populations of nine species. This hunting does, or could potentially, benefit 20 species and subspecies, and people. Among other concerns, the impact assessment failed to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where such hunting occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss alternative regulatory options.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

Here, we show how the cyanobacterial clock buffers genetic and environmental perturbations through its core phosphorylation loop. We first characterise single-cell clock dynamics in clock mutants using a microfluidics device that allows precise control of the microenvironment. We find known clock regulators are dispensable for clock robustness, whilst perturbations of the core clock reveal that the wild-type operates at a noise optimum that we can reproduce in a stochastic model of just the core phosphorylation loop. We then examine how the clock responds to noisy environments, including natural light conditions. The model accurately predicts how the clock filters out environmental noise, including fast light fluctuations, to keep time while remaining responsive to environmental shifts. Our findings illustrate how a simple clock network can exhibit complex noise filtering properties, advancing our understanding of how biological circuits can perform accurately in natural environments.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

We single-cell sequenced 5.7 million T cells from ten donors' autologous blood and tonsils and sought to answer key questions about T cell receptor biology previously unanswerable by smaller-scale experiments. We identified distinct clonal expansions and distributions in blood compared to tonsils, with surprisingly low (1-7%) clonal sharing. These few shared clones exhibited divergent phenotypes across bodily sites. Analysis of antigen-specific CD8 T cells revealed location as a main determinant of frequency, phenotype, and immunodominance. Finally, diversity estimates from the tissue recalibrates current repertoire diversity estimates, and we provide a refined estimate of whole-body repertoire.

Yet it is unknown whether ongoing deliberation can be expressed during movement, following movement onset and prior to any decision. Here we tested the idea that an ongoing deliberation continually influences motor processes--prior to a decision--directing online movements. Over three experiments, we manipulated evidence to influence deliberation during movement. The deliberation process was manipulated by having participants observe evidence in the form of tokens that moved into a left or right target. Supporting our hypothesis we found that lateral hand movements reflected deliberation, prior to a decision. We also found that a deliberation urgency signal, which more heavily weighs later evidence, was fundamental to predicting decisions and explains past movement behaviour in a new light. Our paradigm promotes the expression of ongoing deliberation through movement, providing a powerful new window into understanding the interplay between decision and action.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

ObjectiveThe objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity/alloimmunization potential of Helaina rhLF (effera) from K. phaffii over a 28-day period compared to bovine LF (bLF). It was hypothesized that rhLF would have an equal or lower immunogenic potential compared to bLF, which is permitted for use in conventional foods and infant formula in the EU and US.

MethodsStudy 1 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel arm, controlled trial where 66 healthy adults were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups: high-dose rhLF (3.4 g/d), low-dose rhLF (0.34 g/d), or bLF (3.4 g/d) (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06012669). Participants completed a 28-day (Day 28) supplementation period followed by a 28-day washout period (Day 56) and an additional 28-day follow-up period (Day 84). Study 2 was a 12-week observational study with no intervention that enrolled 24 healthy adults. In both studies, fasting blood was obtained on Days 0, 28, 56, and 84 for analysis of anti-bLF and anti-hLF antibody levels as the primary endpoint as well as other secondary safety endpoints including complete blood count, iron biomarkers, and metabolic panel.

ResultsIn Study 1, the change from baseline to Day 56 in serum anti-bLF antibodies in the bLF group (least squares geometric mean and 95% confidence interval for the post/pre ratio: 3.01; 2.08, 4.35) was greater than the changes in serum anti-hLF antibodies in the low-dose rhLF (1.07; 0.77, 1.49; P<0.001) and high-dose rhLF (1.02; 0.62, 1.70; P<0.001) groups. In Study 2, the post/pre ratio at Day 56 in serum anti-hLF and anti-bLF antibodies were 1.00 (0.93, 1.08) and 1.01 (0.94, 1.09), respectively, confirming no change in anti-hLF antibodies in Study 1 or Study 2. Changes in all safety outcomes in Study 1 were similar between groups and within normal ranges.

ConclusionThese results support the safety and tolerability of efferaTM as a food ingredient at an intake level up to 3.4 g/d in healthy adults.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670033

Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of immune dysregulation at the clinical, cellular, and molecular level in hundreds of individuals with DS.

By systematically analyzing multiple different media components from multiple different suppliers, we identified the source of the problem. Specific lots of agar, from different suppliers, were toxic. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect was attenuated on rich media.

In particular, red-shifted opsins offer access deeper within the brain tissue. It is however crucial to consider the potential unintended back-activation of endogenous opsins due to laser light striking the back of the retina. Here, we found that in complete darkness and with no expression of exogenous opsins, optical fiber laser stimulation at wavelengths of 637 nm (red), 594 nm (yellow), or 473 nm (blue) from within the ipsilateral mouse visual cortex resulted in a strong neuronal response in its contralateral counterpart. This neuronal activation occurred even at low laser intensities (1mW at the fiber tip, 31.8mW/mm2) and was most pronounced using red wavelengths. We therefore took advantage of retinal light adaptation using external illumination with a relatively dim ambient light source (20 lux) which was found to completely abolish orange and blue laser-evoked neuronal activation from within the brain, even at high laser intensities (15mW, 477.3mW/mm2). To prevent red laser-evoked retinal activation, however, only much lower intensities (2.5mW, 79.6mW/mm2) combined with external illumination (20 lux) could be used. These findings demonstrate the critical need for careful selection of light wavelengths and intensities for laser stimulation during optogenetic experiments in the mouse brain in vivo. Additionally, light adaptation of the retina through ambient light exposure offers an effective solution to minimize unintended retinal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

This emphasizes the need for tools to experimentally test these theoretical predictions. We introduce MicroEcoTools, an R package designed to test ecological framework predictions using microbial community data. It assesses microbial diversity and evaluates the relative impacts of stochastic and deterministic assembly mechanisms through a taxa-based null model approach for replicated designs. Specifically, the package allows application of Grime's trait-based life-history categories-competitor, stress-tolerant, and ruderal (CSR)-to taxa, functional traits, and ecosystem functions within microbial communities. MicroEcoTools also includes relevant statistical tests, numeric simulations, and publicly available datasets for demonstration. In conclusion, MicroEcoTools facilitates the application of ecological frameworks, including community assembly mechanisms, diversity analysis, and life-history strategies, to microbial ecosystems under disturbance.

To contribute to the inward Ca2+ flux that drives Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release, CaV1.2 channels must be expressed on the sarcolemma; thus the regulatory mechanisms that tune CaV1.2 expression to meet contractile demand are an emerging area of research. A ubiquitously expressed protein called 14-3-3 has been proposed to affect Ca2+ channel trafficking in non-myocytes, however whether 14-3-3 has similar effects on CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. 14-3-3 preferentially binds phospho-serine/threonine residues to affect many cellular processes and is known to regulate cardiac ion channels including NaV1.5 and hERG. Altered 14-3-3 expression and function have been implicated in cardiac pathologies including hypertrophy. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and regulates cardiac CaV1.2 trafficking and recycling. Confocal imaging, proximity ligation assays, super-resolution imaging, and co-immunoprecipitation revealed a population of 14-3-3 colocalized and closely associated with CaV1.2. The degree of 14-3-3/CaV1.2 colocalization increased upon stimulation of {beta}-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Notably, only the 14-3-3-associated CaV1.2 population displayed increased cluster size with isoproterenol, revealing a role for 14-3-3 as a nucleation factor that directs CaV1.2 super-clustering. 14-3-3 overexpression increased basal CaV1.2 cluster size and Ca2+ currents in ventricular myocytes, with maintained channel responsivity to isoproterenol. In contrast, isoproterenol-stimulated augmentation of sarcolemmal CaV1.2 expression and currents in ventricular myocytes were abrogated by 14-3-3 inhibition. These data support a model where 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to promote enhanced trafficking/recycling, clustering, and activity during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

We propose doing this computationally using Ancestral State Reconstruction (ASR) over phylogenetic trees. Bayesian phylogenetic trees have shown promise as a tool to study the evolution of chant melodies, by inferring a plausible topology of chant transmission. However, the inferred trees cannot be used as ASR inputs directly, because they are undirected, and their branch lengths conflate time and evolutionary rate. We therefore first apply Divergence Time Estimation (DTE) to separate them and represent the tree in a directed form on the time dimension. Using ASR, we then obtain reconstructions of melodies for each of the ancestral nodes, in addition to their distribution in time obtained from DTE, and thus we obtain a phylogeny of chant melody with a music-historical interpretation. We applied this method to the Christmas Vespers dataset, and compare the results against musicological knowledge and melodies reconstructed at Solesmes using methods of contemporary philology, which shows potential for reconstructing cultural transmission through time.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670033

Indeed, a major challenge is that variants do not act in isolation but rather in the framework of highly complex biological networks, such as the human metabolic network, which can amplify or buffer the effect of specific risk alleles on disease susceptibility. In our previous work, we established that metabolic models can be leveraged to simulate the emerging metabolic effects of genetically driven variation in transcript levels and estimate personalized metabolic reaction fluxes. Here we use genetically predicted reaction fluxes to perform a systematic search for metabolic fluxes acting as buffers or amplifiers of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk alleles. Our analysis identifies 30 risk locus - reaction flux pairs with significant interaction on CAD susceptibility involving 18 individual reaction fluxes and 8 independent risk loci. Notably, many of these reactions are linked to processes with putative roles in the disease such as the metabolism of inflammatory mediators and fatty acids. In summary, this work establishes proof of concept that biochemical reaction fluxes can have non-additive effects with risk alleles and provides novel insights into the interplay between metabolism and genetic variation on disease susceptibility.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670034

Hungry animals prioritize food seeking and feeding behaviors, while sated animals suppress these behaviors to engage in other activities. Additionally, neuronal activity and synaptic transmission are among the most energy expensive processes. Yet neurons do not uptake nutrients from the circulation. Instead, glia fulfill this highly evolutionary conserved function. Recent studies have shown that glia can modulate neuronal activity and behavior. However, how different glia subtypes sense metabolic state and modulate neurons and behavior is incompletely understood. Here, we unravel two types of glia-mediated modulation of metabolic state-dependent behavior. In food-deprived flies, astrocyte-like and perineurial glia promote foraging and feeding, respectively, while cortex glia suppress these behaviors. We further show that adenosine and adenosine receptor modulate intracellular calcium levels in these glia subtypes, which ultimately controls behavior. This study reveals a new mechanism how different glia subtypes sense the metabolic state of the animal and modulate its behavior accordingly.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

A dramatic cage-to-tube transformation is facilitated by an untethered alpha-helix domain that prevents the 3-fold symmetry interaction and imparts a torsion between the building blocks. The unique double- and triple-stranded helical arrangements of subunits are mathematically optimal tiling patterns for this type of pentamer.

The underlying mechanisms for this observation are still unknown. Sensory neurons transmit noxious signals from inflamed joints to the central nervous system, where a pain percept is generated. We investigated whether JAKi exert direct effects on sensory neurons. Methods: In-house and public RNA sequencing datasets of sensory neurons were analysed for relevant JAK/STAT and cytokine-receptor gene expression. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC)-derived sensory neurons were stimulated with serum and synovial fluid (SF) from individuals with RA, or with selected cytokines that were found in RA SF by Luminex. Phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) was assessed by Western blot. Sensory neuron activation was examined by recording neuronal firing using multi-electrode array and measuring expression levels of pain-relevant genes with STAT3-binding sites. Results: Cell-free RA synovial fluid induced pSTAT3 in IPSC-derived sensory neurons, an effect which was completely blocked by the JAKi tofacitinib. Compared to paired serum, RA SF was enriched for the JAK/STAT cytokines IL-6, IL-11, LIF, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, with their requisite receptors present on sensory neurons. Stimulation of IPSC-derived sensory neurons with these recombinant cytokines recapitulated pSTAT3 induction in these cells. Furthermore, IL-6+sIL-6R or LIF upregulated expression of pain-relevant genes which was blocked by tofacitinib. Finally, we provided evidence that LIF can induce neuronal sensitisation. Conclusion: Our data indicate that JAKi can act directly on sensory neurons, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for their suggested superior analgesic properties.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

To address this question, we optogenetically silenced the dHPC or the vHPC while simultaneously recording from the PFC of mice performing a SWM task. We found that whereas both HPC subregions were necessary during the encoding phase of the task, only the dHPC was necessary during the choice phase. Silencing of either subregion altered the spatial firing patterns of PFC neurons. However, only silencing of the vHPC affected their coding of spatial goals. These results thus reveal distinct contributions of the dorsal and ventral HPC poles to SWM and the coding of behaviorally-relevant spatial information by PFC neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Cells lost by abrasion are replaced by division of both corneal epithelial cells and populations of stem cells around the corneal periphery, the limbus. Limbal-derived epithelial cells migrate into the cornea, retaining equal cell loss and replacement rates (the 'XYZ hypothesis'). This process leads to a striking stable spiral cell motion pattern across the corneal surface, with a central vortex. Here, we show that the emergence of the spiral pattern can be explained by the interplay of the position of the limbus, cell division, extrusion, and collective cell migration along the curved surface of the cornea. Using dissected LacZ mosaic murine corneas, we inferred the flow field on the curved surface by following stripe edges, revealing a tightening spiral. To explain the flow fields, we developed a cell-level, in silico model of the mouse cornea. Corneal epithelial cells were treated as mechanically soft, self-propelled particles with density-dependent proliferation and extrusion rates, and noisy alignment of the direction of migration. Even without any global guidance cues, the model predicted that migration patterns form stripes and spirals closely recapitulating those in the experiment. To understand the origin and properties of this flow field, we complemented the particle-based model with a continuum description of cell flux on the cornea that generalises the XYZ hypothesis of steady-state balance between cell divisions and extrusions. The work, therefore, demonstrates how the physics of swarms on curved surfaces can provide quantitative explanations of biological processes at the tissue scale.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Here, we reveal that embryoid body in vitro differentiation generates two distinct lineages of mesodermal cells matching YS and allantois respectively. Combining in vitro models with in vivo chimeric embryo analysis, we discover that Eomesodermin (Eomes) regulates the formation of a subset of YS-fated ExEM but is dispensable for allantois formation. Furthermore, simultaneous disruption of Eomes and T impedes the specification of any YS or allantois mesoderm, indicating compensatory roles for T during allantois formation when Eomes is disrupted.

Without a reference genome, however, gene calling is cumbersome and inaccurate due to the high degree of redundancy in de novo transcriptome assemblies. To simplify and increase the accuracy of de novo transcriptome assembly in the absence of a reference genome, we developed UnigeneFinder. Combining several clustering methods, UnigeneFinder substantially reduces the redundancy typical of raw transcriptome assemblies. This pipeline offers an effective solution to the problem of inflated transcript numbers, achieving a closer representation of the actual underlying genome. UnigeneFinder performs comparably or better, compared to existing tools, on plant species with varying genome complexities. UnigeneFinder is the only available transcriptome redundancy solution that fully automates the generation of primary transcript, coding region, and protein sequences, analogous to those available for high quality reference genomes. These features, coupled with the pipeline's cross-platform implementation and focus on automation and an accessible user interface, make UnigeneFinder a useful tool for many downstream sequence-based analyses in non-model organisms lacking a reference genome, including differential gene expression analysis, accurate ortholog identification, functional enrichments, and evolutionary analyses. UnigeneFinder also runs efficiently both on high-performance computing (HPC) systems and personal computers, further reducing barriers to use.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

During adolescence, the maturation of PFC is proposed to be a critical period (CP) for executive function, driven by a break in balance between glutamatergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition (E/I) neurotransmission. During CPs, cortical circuitry fine-tunes to improve information processing and reliable responses to stimuli, shifting from spontaneous to evoked activity, enhancing the SNR, and promoting neural synchronization. Harnessing 7T MR spectroscopy and EEG in a longitudinal cohort (N = 164, ages 10-32 years, 283 neuroimaging sessions), we outline associations between age-related changes in glutamate and GABA neurotransmitters and EEG measures of cortical SNR. We find developmental decreases in spontaneous activity and increases in cortical SNR during our auditory steady state task using 40 Hz stimuli. Decreases in spontaneous activity were associated with glutamate levels in DLPFC, while increases in cortical SNR were associated with more balanced Glu and GABA levels. These changes were associated with improvements in working memory performance. This study provides evidence of CP plasticity in the human PFC during adolescence, leading to stabilized circuitry that allows for the optimal recruitment and integration of multisensory input, resulting in improved executive function.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Here, we assess the contribution of variation in viral load and daily contact rates to this heterogeneity by combining viral load and contact survey data in a mathematical model to estimate the secondary infection distribution. Using data from the BBC Pandemic and CoMix contact surveys, we estimate the basic reproduction number (R0 = 2.2, 95% CI 2.1-2.2) from first principles and the secondary infection distribution throughout the pandemic in the UK in 2020, and the effectiveness of frequent and pre-event rapid testing for reducing superspreading events. We find that individual heterogeneity in contacts - rather than individual heterogeneity in shedding - drives observed heterogeneity in the secondary infection distribution. Our results suggest that regular testing every 3 days, or pre-event testing with a minimum event size of 10, could reduce the mean reproduction number below 1 with moderate to high levels of uptake (60-80%) for pre-pandemic contact levels. This work demonstrates the potential for using viral load and contact data to predict heterogeneity in transmission and the effectiveness of rapid testing strategies for curbing transmission in future pandemics.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670034

Yet, for many species of corals, a basic understanding of the early life-history stages is lacking. In this study, we report our observations for ex situ reproduction in the massive reef-building coral Porites lobata across two years. Spawning occurred in April and May, on the first day after the full moon with at least two hours of darkness between sunset and moonrise, on a rising tide. Only a small proportion of corals observed had mature gametes or spawned (17-35%). Eggs were 185-311 um in diameter, spherical, homogenous, and provisioned with 95-155 Symbiodiniaceae algae. Males spawned before females, and ex situ fertilization rates were high for the first 2 hours after egg release. P. lobata larvae were elliptical, approximately 300 um long, and symbiotic. Just two days after fertilization, many larvae swam near the bottom of culture dishes and were competent to settle. Settlers began calcification two days after metamorphosis, and tentacles were developed 10 days after attachment. Our observations contrast with previous studies by suggesting an abbreviated pelagic larval period in P. lobata, which could lead to the isolation of some populations. The high thermal tolerance and a broad geographic range of P. lobata suggest this species could locally adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions, especially if larvae are locally retained. The results of this study can inform future work on reproduction, larval biology, dispersal, and recruitment of P. lobata, which could have an ecological advantage over less resilient coral species under future climate change.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

We generated a model of reduced dietary obesity (ReDO) whereby male mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice were calorically restricted until weight matched to control mice, and then after a 24-hour food assessment period were pair-fed relative to control mice. We subsequently generated ReDO mice that, after CR, were pair-fed relative to control mice for 0, 8, or 28 days, or chronically. Body weight, food intake, and select metabolic parameters were measured, along with whole hypothalamic Pomc gene expression.

In this study, we demonstrate that abundance of the commensal metabolite pentanoate is predictive for survival of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell patients. Its implementation in the CAR T cell manufacturing workflow overcomes solid tumor microenvironments in immunocompetent cancer models by hijacking the epigenetic-metabolic crosstalk, reducing exhaustion and promoting naive-like differentiation. While synergy of clinically relevant drugs mimicked the phenotype of pentanoate-engineered CAR T cells in vitro, in vivo challenge showed inferior tumor control. Metabolic tracing of 13C-pentanoate revealed citrate generation in the TCA cycle via the acetyl- and succinyl-CoA entry points as a unique feature of the C5 aliphatic chain. Inhibition of the ATP-citrate lyase, which links metabolic output and histone acetylation, led to accumulation of pentanoate-derived citrate from the succinyl-CoA route and decreased functionality of SCFA-engineered CAR T cells.

In response to seasonal changes, FT is induced in phloem companion cells located in distal leaf regions. Thus far, a detailed molecular characterization of the FT-expressing cells has been lacking. Here, we used bulk nuclei RNA-seq and single nuclei RNA (snRNA)-seq to investigate gene expression in FT-expressing cells and other phloem companion cells. Our bulk nuclei RNA-seq demonstrated that FT-expressing cells in cotyledons and in true leaves differed transcriptionally. Within the true leaves, our snRNA-seq analysis revealed that companion cells with high FT expression form a unique cluster in which many genes involved in ATP biosynthesis are highly upregulated. The cluster also expresses other genes encoding small proteins, including the flowering and stem growth inducer FPF1-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (FLP1) and the anti-florigen BROTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (BFT). In addition, we found that the promoters of FT and the genes co-expressed with FT in the cluster were enriched for the consensus binding motifs of NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1 (NIGT1). Overexpression of the paralogous NIGT1.2 and NIGT1.4 repressed FT expression and significantly delayed flowering under nitrogen-rich conditions, consistent with NIGT1s acting as nitrogen-dependent FT repressors.

Brain state-dependent TMS approaches are a promising solution to this problem, but inter-individual variation in lesion location and oscillatory dynamics can make translating them to the poststroke brain challenging. Personalized brain state-dependent approaches specifically designed to address these challenges are therefore needed. METHODS: As a first step towards this goal, we tested a novel machine learning-based EEG-TMS system that identifies personalized brain activity patterns reflecting strong and weak corticospinal tract (CST) output (strong and weak CST states) in healthy adults in real-time. Participants completed a single-session study that included the acquisition of a TMS-EEG-EMG training dataset, personalized classifier training, and real-time EEG-informed single pulse TMS during classifier-predicted personalized CST states. RESULTS: MEP amplitudes elicited in real-time during personalized strong CST states were significantly larger than those elicited during personalized weak and random CST states. MEP amplitudes elicited in real-time during personalized strong CST states were also significantly less variable than those elicited during personalized weak CST states. Personalized CST states lasted for ~1-2 seconds at a time and ~1 second elapsed between consecutive similar states. Individual participants exhibited unique differences in spectro-spatial EEG patterns between personalized strong and weak CST states. CONCLUSION: Our results show for the first time that personalized whole-brain EEG activity patterns predict CST activation in real-time in healthy humans. These findings represent a pivotal step towards using personalized brain state-dependent TMS interventions to promote poststroke CST function.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Our current understanding of Tre6P metabolism and signalling is predominantly based on studies in Arabidopsis thaliana. Some features could be adapted to the specific physiology, anatomy, and life cycle of this C3 eudicot model species, and thus might not be representative of other angiosperms. To better understand the regulation of carbon metabolism by Tre6P in monocot C4 species we used Setaria viridis, which has been widely adopted as a model for the major C4 NADP-malic enzyme subtype crop species, such as maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). In this work, we analysed the levels of transcripts encoding Tre6P-related enzymes in different tissues and cell types from S. viridis. The TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE1 transcript, its encoded protein (TPS1, the enzyme responsible for Tre6P synthesis) and Tre6P were mainly located in bundle sheath cells of S. viridis. Our results show that Tre6P is predominately synthesized and located in bundle sheath and associated cells, where it could play a fundamental role in the regulation of sucrose levels by modulating phloem loading.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

In this study, we identified Replication Protein A (RPA) as a novel telomerase processivity factor, functioning alongside the telomerase recruitment factor TPP1-POT1. AlphaFold2 predictions revealed that RPA and TPP1 interact with telomerase at distinct binding sites. Using separation-of-function mutants, we discovered that RPA-mediated telomerase stimulation is indispensable for telomere elongation, while TPP1-POT1 primarily functions in recruiting telomerase to telomeres. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short telomere disease-associated telomerase mutations compromise RPA's ability to stimulate telomerase, establishing a link between impaired RPA-dependent processivity and telomeropathies. Our findings redefine human telomerase regulation by establishing RPA as a critical regulator and provide new insights into the molecular basis of telomere-related diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Large-scale studies have been able to detect genetic variants with contributions to height in the range of approximately 1.2 millimetre per allele copy on average. Non-additive genetic interactions may, in part, account for the difference between broad-sense and narrow-sense heritability estimates. However, prior studies have failed to identify variants with non-additive effects, possibly due to the lack of statistical power. Leveraging 3.6M individuals of European genetic ancestry in the 23andMe research cohort, we performed a genome-wide analysis study (GWAS) to select 1,063 independent common SNPs associated with height (p-value < 5e-8), and then screened for evidence of non-additive effects by analysing 564,453 models including a pairwise SNP-SNP interaction term. We identified 69 pairwise models with suggestive evidence of SNP-SNP interaction (p-value < 1e-4) and, for each SNP pair, we evaluated a fully saturated model including additive, dominant, and epistatic (additive-by-additive, additive-by-dominance and dominance-by-dominance) terms. We tested for the presence of epistatic interactions by comparing models with and without epistatic terms using a likelihood ratio test. Assuming a strict Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 8.9e-8 (0.05/564,453), we found no evidence of epistatic interactions (Likelihood ratio test (LRT) p-value < 9e-07 for all models). Our analysis rules out the existence of epistatic interactions between alleles of >1% frequency with effect sizes larger than 2.42mm. Our large-scale analysis provides further evidence of the minimal contribution of non-additivity in the genetic architecture of adult human height.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

In this context, a major transcriptional response of microglia is the upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We hypothesised that the isoforms functionally alter microglia by shaping their transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We used RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia isolated from a xenotransplantation model of AD. We identified widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype, and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoforms protective role.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Individuals with pathological MAPT variants exhibit behavioural changes, cognitive impairment and signs of parkinsonism. Missense mutations of residue P301, which are the most common MAPT mutations associated with FTDP-17, give rise to the assembly of mutant four-repeat tau into filamentous inclusions, in the absence of extracellular deposits. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from five individuals belonging to three unrelated families with mutation P301L and from one individual belonging to a family with mutation P301T. A novel three-lobed tau fold resembling the two-layered tau fold of Picks disease was present in all cases with the P301L tau mutation. Two different tau folds were found in the case with mutation P301T, the less abundant of which was a variant of the three-lobed fold. The major P301T tau fold was V-shaped, with partial similarity to the four-layered tau folds of corticobasal degeneration and argyrophilic grain disease. These findings suggest that FTDP-17 with mutations in P301 should be considered distinct inherited tauopathies and that model systems with these mutations should be used with caution in the study of sporadic tauopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Pallatom directly learns and models the joint distribution P(structure, seq) by focusing on P(all-atom), effectively addressing the interdependence between sequence and structure in protein generation. To achieve this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for all-atom protein generation. Our model employs a dual-track framework that tokenizes proteins into tokenlevel and atomic-level representations, integrating them through a multi-layer decoding process with ""traversing"" representations and recycling mechanism. We also introduce the atom14 representation method, which unifies the description of unknown side-chain coordinates, ensuring high fidelity between the generated all-atom conformation and its physical structure. Experimental results demonstrate that Pallatom excels in key metrics of protein design, including designability, diversity, and novelty, showing significant improvements across the board. Our model not only enhances the accuracy of protein generation but also exhibits excellent training efficiency, paving the way for future applications in larger and more complex systems.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

While CAs have been linked to mitotic errors resulting in the emergence of nuclear atypias4-7, the underlying processes and basal rates of spontaneous CA formation in human cells remain under-explored. Here we introduce machine learning-assisted genomics-and-imaging convergence (MAGIC), an autonomously operated platform that integrates automated live-cell imaging of micronucleated cells, machine learning in real-time, and single-cell genomics to investigate de novo CA formation at scale. Applying MAGIC to near-diploid, non-transformed cell lines, we track CA events over successive cell cycles, highlighting the common role of dicentric chromosomes as an initiating event. We determine the baseline CA rate, which approximately doubles in TP53-deficient cells, and show that chromosome losses arise more rapidly than gains. The targeted induction of DNA double-strand breaks along chromosomes triggers distinct CA processes, revealing stable isochromosomes, amplification and coordinated segregation of isoacentric segments in multiples of two, and complex CA outcomes, depending on the break location. Our data contrast de novo CA spectra from somatic mutational landscapes after selection occurred. The large-scale experimentation enabled by MAGIC provides insights into de novo CA formation, paving the way to unravel fundamental determinants of chromosome instability.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Here we report that, using an experimental symbiotic system between the stinkbug Plautia stali and the model bacterium Escherichia coli, disruption of a single bacterial gene tnaA encoding tryptophanase makes E. coli mutualistic to P. stali. Survey of natural bacterial mutualists across wild populations of P. stali and other stinkbug species uncovered that their Pantoea-allied symbionts consistently lack tnaA gene. Some Pantoea species like P. ananatis retain tnaA gene and cannot establish symbiosis with P. stali, but tnaA-disrupted P. ananatis partially restored the symbiotic capability. When a natural Pantoea mutualist of P. stali was transformed with a functional tna operon, its symbiotic capability reduced significantly.

It imposes an enormous symptomatic burden on patients, leaving many with residual disease despite optimal procedural therapy, and up to 1/3 with debilitating angina amenable neither to procedures, nor to current pharmacologic options. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist originally approved for management of diabetes, has garnered substantial attention for its capacity to attenuate cardiovascular risk. Although subgroup analyses in patients indicate promise, studies explicitly designed to isolate the impact of semaglutide on the sequelae of CAD, independently of comorbid diabetes or obesity, are lacking.

Approach and ResultsYorkshire swine (n=17) underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor around the left circumflex coronary artery to induce CAD. Oral semaglutide was initiated postoperatively at 1.5 mg and scaled up in 2 weeks to 3 mg in treatment animals (SEM, n=8) for a total of 5 weeks, while control animals (CON, n=9) received no drug. All then underwent myocardial harvest with acquisition of perfusion and functional data using microsphere injection and pressure-volume loop catheterization. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were performed on the most ischemic myocardial segments for mechanistic elucidation. SEM animals exhibited improved left ventricular ejection fraction, both at rest and during rapid myocardial pacing (both p<0.03), accompanied by increased perfusion to the most ischemic myocardial region at rest and during rapid pacing (both p<0.03); reduced perivascular and interstitial fibrosis (both p <0.03); and apoptosis (p=0.008). These changes were associated with increased activation of the endothelial-protective AMPK pathway (p=0.005), coupled with downstream increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p=0.014).

ConclusionThis study is the first to reveal the capacity of oral semaglutide to augment cardiac function in the chronically ischemic heart in a highly translational large animal model, likely through AMPK-mediated improvement in endothelial function and perfusion to the ischemic myocardium.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

This study shows a trend of weakening of the binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape of our medical defenses. We also found that based on the wide variety of host species and geographic locations in which H5N1 was observed to have been transmitted from birds to mammals, there is not a single central reservoir host species or location associated with H5N1's spread.

To address this challenge, we labeled primary mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subclones with DNA barcodes to characterize their pre-metastatic state using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq and determine their relative in vivo metastatic potential prospectively. We identified a gene signature separating metastasis-high and metastasis-low subclones orthogonal to the normal-to-PDAC and classical-to-basal axes. The metastasis-high subclones feature activation of IL-1 pathway genes and high NF-{kappa}B and Zeb/Snail family activity and the metastasis-low subclones feature activation of neuroendocrine, motility, and Wnt pathway genes and high CDX2 and HOXA13 activity. In a functional screen, we validated novel mediators of PDAC metastasis in the IL-1 pathway, including the NF-{kappa}B targets Fos and Il23a, and beyond the IL-1 pathway including Myo1b and Tmem40. We scored human PDAC tumors for our signature of metastatic potential from mouse and found that metastases have higher scores than primary tumors. Moreover, primary tumors with higher scores are associated with worse prognosis. We also found that our metastatic potential signature is enriched in other human carcinomas, suggesting that it is conserved across epithelial malignancies. This work establishes a strategy for linking cancer cell state to future behavior, reveals novel functional regulators of PDAC metastasis, and establishes a method for scoring human carcinomas based on metastatic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Unfortunately, for higher taxonomic ranks such as genus, establishing a generally accepted approach based on genome analysis is challenging. While core-genome phylogenies depict the evolutionary relationships among species, determining the correspondence between clades and genera may not be straightforward. For genotypic divergence, percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) and genome-wide average amino acid identity (AAI) are commonly used, but often do not provide a clear threshold for classification. In this work, we investigated the utility of global comparisons and data visualization in identifying clusters of species based on their overall gene content, and rationalized that such patterns can be integrated with phylogeny and other information such as phenotypes for improving taxonomy. As a proof of concept, we selected 177 representative genome sequences from the Mycoplasmatales-Entomoplasmatales clade within the class Mollicutes for a case study. We found that the clustering patterns corresponded to the current understanding of these organisms, namely the split into three above-genus groups: Hominis, Pneumoniae, and Spiroplasma-Entomoplasmataceae-Mycoides (SEM). However, at the genus level, several important issues were found. For example, recent taxonomic revisions that split the Hominis group into three genera and Entomoplasmataceae into five genera are problematic, as those newly described or emended genera lack clear differentiations in gene content from one another. Moreover, several cases of mis-classification were identified. These findings demonstrated the utility of this approach and the potential application for other bacteria.

Impact statementTaxonomy provides a foundation for communication that involves biological entities. As such, robust classification and standardized nomenclature are critical. In recent years, genome analysis has been widely adopted for delineating species, but generally accepted approaches for delineating higher taxonomic ranks such as genus are lacking. In this work, we demonstrated that the comparison of overall gene content among species provides an intuitive method for identifying groups of similar organisms that can correspond to genera. Moreover, several critical issues were identified when we applied the method to evaluate recent taxonomic revisions that affected many pathogens with biomedical or economic importance. These findings serve as a cautionary tale against the over-reliance of core-genome centered approaches in taxonomy.

Using two different approaches - a neuron-specific transgenic reprogrammable mouse model and neuron-specific targeted lentiviral delivery of OSKM reprogramming factors - we demonstrated that in vivo partial reprogramming of mature neurons in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain, can influence animal behavior, and ameliorate age-related decline in memory and learning.

In several major Asian cities, public food centres are the main venue for food consumption and yet we lack a baseline understanding of their environmental microbiomes. We conducted city-wide metagenomic surveillance of food-centre microbiomes in Singapore (16 centres, n=240 samples) to provide a detailed map of microbial (bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses) as well as non-microbial DNA abundances across two timepoints. Food-centre microbiomes were found to be enriched in food-related DNA signatures compared to other environments such as hospitals and offices, with specific food-microbe associations (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae and fish) and food DNA providing a partial explanation for the microbial profiles observed (44% of variation explained). Machine learning analysis identified a small set of microbial species (n=22) that serve as highly accurate (>80%) location-specific signatures for various food centres, some of which persist even after 3 years. Profiling of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens identified a surprising enrichment of ARGs in food centres relative to other non-healthcare environments (>2.5{xi}), and an order of magnitude enrichment of key pathogenic species (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp) even compared to hospital environments. These results highlight the contribution of diverse biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the unique microbiome profiles of different food-centre environments, and the potential for using metagenomic surveillance to understand the risk for infections and antibiotic resistance gene transmission.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670034

Here, we found that an understudied splice isoform of tau termed ""big tau"" is significantly more abundant in the brain regions less vulnerable to tau pathology compared to tau pathology-vulnerable regions. We used various cellular and animal models to demonstrate that big tau possesses multiple properties that can resist AD-related pathological changes. Importantly, human AD patients show a higher expression level of pathology-resisting big tau in the cerebellum, the brain region spared from tau pathology.

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670034

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670034

As the zebrafish embryo grows into a larva, to improve its heart function, the embryonic myocardial wall transforms into an intricate 3D architecture, composed of an outer compact layer enveloping an inner layer of multicellular trabecular ridges. How these tissue layers acquire their characteristic form suited for their function remains an open question. Here, we find that multiscale mechanochemical coupling and an emergent tissue-scale morphological transition steer functional maturation of the developing zebrafish heart. Single-celled trabecular seeds recruit outer compact layer cells to mature into clonally heterogenous multicellular ridges, thereby amplifying cardiac contractile forces. In response, remaining compact layer cells are stretched, which impedes their further recruitment, thereby constraining trabecular ridge density. Concomitantly, Notch-dependent actomyosin dampening triggers a sharp transition in myocardial tissue area, activating rapid organ growth that expands blood filling capacity. Thus, multiscale self-organizing interactions optimize heart size and contractile efficiency to support embryonic life.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034

This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670034

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1724191670034

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1724191670034
