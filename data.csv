This study aimed to analyse any possible connection between these factors. Methods: The top performing 18 nations from 2012, 2016 and 2020 Olympics (after Russia and Ukraine were excluded) had their relative Gold medals, total medals and medal points (Gold =3, Silver=2, Bronze=1) for Paris 2024 analysed using a backward stepwise linear regression model. Initial input factors included previous medal tallies, home city advantage, time zone effects, national excess deaths 2020-2023, average GDP growth 2020-2023 and number of country signatories to the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD), with factors >P=0.10 removed sequentially. Results: Total medals were best predicted by previous total medals (t=21.0, P<0.001) and home city advantage (t=4.1, P<0.001). Gold medals were best predicted by previous Gold medals (t=10.3, P<0.001), low national excess deaths (t=-3.2, P<0.007) and low signatories to the GBD (t=-2.2, P<0.05). Medal points were best predicted by previous medal points (t=18.1, P<0.001), home city advantage (t=3.2, P<0.007) and low national excess deaths (t=-1.8, P<0.09). Discussion: The Western Pacific countries with a COVID-cautious national perspective (Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea) tended to win more Gold medals than expected in Paris, compared to countries with a COVID-stoical national perspective (e.g. Great Britain, United States) which won fewer Golds than expected. This suggests that a COVID-cautious mentality may have contributed to better performance than a COVID-stoical approach. It is unclear whether any mechanism was physiological (less infectious disease impact before or during the Olympics) or psychological. If this effect existed for Golds, it did not appear to have any effect on Silver and Bronze medals.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474600

To explore it, we analyzed deep proteomic and transcriptomic data from over 1,000 human samples, including 6 cancer types and 26 healthy human tissues. This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in 1,990 proteins. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abundance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. Both the sequence and the tissue-specificity of alternatively translated proteins are conserved between human and mouse. These results demonstrate the contribution of alternate translation to diversifying mammalian proteomes, and its association with protein stability, tissue-specific proteomes, and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Here, we have characterized 62,126 fully synthetic DNA sequences to bottom-up dissect design principles of cell-state specific enhancers in the context of the differentiation of blood stem cells to seven myeloid lineages. Focusing on binding sites for 38 TFs and their pairwise interactions, we found that identical sites displayed both repressive and activating function, as a consequence of cellular context, site combinatorics, or simply predicted occupancy of a TF on an enhancer. Surprisingly, we found that combinations of activating sites frequently neutralized each other or even gained repressive function. These negative synergies convert quantitative imbalances in transcription factor expression into binary downstream activity patterns, a principle that can be exploited to build differentiation-state specific enhancers from scratch.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

A central question is how individual subunits within these complexes can evolve novel functions while maintaining the integrity of the original assembly. Here, we explore this question by tracing the evolutionary trajectory of the plant exocyst, an octameric complex essential for exocytosis in eukaryotes. Remarkably, the Exo70 subunit underwent dramatic expansion and functional divergence in plants. We demonstrate that electrostatic alterations in the N-terminal region of the Exo70 subunit precipitated its dissociation from the exocyst complex. This release mitigated paralog interference, thereby facilitating the subunit's extensive functional co-option. Our findings reveal a nuanced mechanism by which a protein subunit, ancestrally constrained within a multimeric complex, can escape those constraints and evolve novel functions, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of cellular innovation.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

While major signalling pathways critical for this control have been identified3, how they achieve such a tight balance in cell type composition remains unclear. Here, we uncover dynamic expression of Hes1, a direct NOTCH target, in intestinal stem and progenitor cells, and investigate its role in vivo and in vitro. A knock-in reporter reveals distinct, cell-specific period lengths in Hes1 oscillations that form a gradient along the crypt-villus axis. Whereas secretory precursors oscillate at low periods, absorptive precursors oscillate at higher periods before transitioning to a differentiated state. To test the function of different oscillation periods, we innovated a microfluidic system that modulates Hes1 oscillations in organoids. We find that varying the oscillation period modulates secretory cell differentiation: While 90-min oscillations promote Paneth cells, 130-min oscillations increase formation of other secretory subtypes. Moreover, low-period oscillations support stemness and a proliferative state. Our study provides the first clear evidence that information for tissue homeostasis in the intestine is encoded in the temporal dynamics of signalling components.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.
- Identifying early signatures of decreased mitochondrial function and bioenergetics capacity could be an important approach to prevent or improve different metabolic diseases through lifestyle changes mainly from exercise and nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

They are involved in the biosynthesis of primary and specialized metabolites, including salicylic acid (SA), a key defense phytohormone synthesized via the conserved chorismate biosynthetic pathway. However, the identity of the signal(s) that ultimately triggers SA induction in chloroplasts upon perception of a biotic threat has remained elusive. Here, we provide evidence of a functional link between chloroplast-derived reactive oxygen species (cROS) and SA production. We observe that inhibiting ROS bursts generated from photosystem II during plant immune activation completely abrogates the induction of SA synthesis in response to immunity-inducing signals, without affecting SA-independent immune responses. Indeed, time course analyses show that the induction of SA marker genes parallels that of cROS production during an immune response. Consistent with this, preventing cROS induction is sufficient to nullify the immune protection normally conferred by activating immunity prior to an infection. Analyses of transcriptomes and photosynthetic efficiency show that two conserved effectors from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae, HopM1 and AvrE1, redundantly disrupt photosynthesis and cROS bursts. These effects reduce SA accumulation and are mediated via the impact of HopM1 and AvrE1 in inducting host abscisic acid signaling. Our results suggest that a change in chloroplastic redox homeostasis induced by biotic stressors acts as an initiator of plant immunity through the production of SA, and that this response is targeted by conserved pathogen effector proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Uncovering the genome-wide activity of all gene regulators across tissues is therefore needed to understand how the genome is regulated during development. Here, we take a first step forward towards achieving this goal. Using CUT&RUN, we systematically measured the genome-wide binding profiles of key transcription factors and cofactors that mediate the activity of ontogenetically relevant signaling pathways in select mouse tissues at two developmental stages. Computation of the numerous genome-wide binding datasets unveiled a large degree of tissue and time-specific activity for each gene regulator, and several factor-specific idiosyncrasies. Moreover, we identified 'popular' regulatory regions that are bound by a multitude of pathway regulators. Popular regions tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, implying their essentiality. Consistently, they lie in the proximity of genes whose dysregulation causes early embryonic lethality in the mouse. Moreover, the human homologs of these regions are also bound by many gene regulators and are highly conserved in human populations, indicating that they retain functional relevance for human development. This work constitutes a decisive step towards under-standing how the genome is simultaneously read and used by gene regulators in a holistic fashion and unveils multiple genomic mechanisms that drive embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

The regulatory logic of differentiation includes factors specific to one or multiple cell types, functioning in a combinatorial fashion. Classic approaches of GRN discovery used perturbational data to elucidate TF-TG links, but are laborious and not scalable across the tree of life. Single cell transcriptomics has emerged as a revolutionary approach to study gene expression with cell type resolution, but incorporating perturbational data is challenging. Planarians, with their pluripotent neoblast stem cells continuously giving rise to all cell types, offer an ideal model to attempt this integration. Despite extensive single cell transcriptomic studies, the transcriptional and chromatin regulation at the cell type level remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the regulatory logic of planarian stem cell differentiation by obtaining an organism-level integration of single cell transcriptomics and single cell accessibility data. We identify specific open chromatin profiles for major differentiated cell types and analyse their transcriptomic landscape, revealing distinct gene modules expressed in individual types and combinations of them. Integrated analysis unveils gene networks reflecting known TF interactions in each type and identifies TFs potentially driving differentiation across multiple cell types. To validate our predictions, we combined TF knockdown RNAi experiments with single cell transcriptomics. We focus on hnf4, a TF known to be expressed in gut phagocytes, and confirm its influence on other types, including parenchymal cells. Our results demonstrate high overlap between predicted targets and experimentally-validated differentially-regulated genes. Overall, our study integrates TFs, TGs and OCRs to reveal the regulatory logic of planarian stem cell differentiation, showcasing that the combination of single cell methods and perturbational studies will be key for characterising GRNs widely.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

While this  one neuron-one receptor motif has long been expected to apply broadly across insects, recent evidence suggests it may not extend to mosquitoes. We sequenced and analyzed the transcriptomes of 46,000 neurons from antennae of the dengue mosquito Aedes aegypti to resolve all olfactory, thermosensory, and hygrosensory neuron subtypes and identify the receptors expressed therein. We find that half of all olfactory subtypes coexpress multiple receptors. However, coexpression occurs almost exclusively among genes from the same family--among odorant receptors (ORs) or among ionotropic receptors (IRs). Coexpression of ORs with IRs is exceedingly rare. Many coexpressed receptors are recent duplicates. In other cases, the recruitment or co-option of single receptors by multiple neuron subtypes has placed these genes together in the same cells with distant paralogs. Close examination of data from Drosophila reveal rare cases of both phenomena, indicating that the olfactory systems of these two species are not fundamentally different, but instead fall at different locations along a continuum likely to encompass diverse insects.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

We find that topical but not intravenous delivery is effective in this model. High-doses of phage reduces bacterial burden more effectively than low-doses, and repeated dosing achieves the highest eradication rates. Building on these insights, we developed HydroPhage, a hyaluronan-based hydrogel system that uses dynamic covalent crosslinking to deliver high-titre phages over one week.

T cells, in particular, leverage their unique T cell receptors (TCRs) to detect specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-presented peptides. TCR activation is then relayed via linker for activation of T cells (LAT), a TCR-proximal disordered adapter protein, which organizes protein partners and mediates the propagation of signals down diverse pathways including NFAT and AP-1. Here, we studied how balanced downstream pathway activation is encoded in the amino acid sequence of LAT. To comprehensively profile the sequence-function relationship of LAT, we developed a pooled, single-cell, high-content screening approach in which a large series of mutants in the LAT protein were analyzed to characterize their effects on T cell activation. Measuring epigenetic, transcriptomic, and cell surface protein dynamics of single cells harboring distinct LAT mutants, we found functional regions spanning over 40% of the LAT amino acid sequence. Conserved sequence motifs for protein interactions along with charge distribution are critical sequence features, and contribute to interpretation of human genetic variation in LAT. While mutant defect severity spans from moderate to complete loss of function, nearly all defective mutants, irrespective of their position in LAT, confer balanced defects across all downstream pathways. To understand the molecular basis for this observation, we performed proximal protein labeling which demonstrated that disruption of LAT interaction with a single partner protein indirectly disrupts other partner interactions, likely through the dual roles of these proteins as effectors of downstream pathways and bridging factors between LAT molecules. Overall, we report widely distributed functional regions throughout a disordered adapter and a precise physical organization of LAT and interacting molecules which constrains signaling outputs. More broadly, we describe an approach for interrogating sequence-function relationships for proteins with complex activities across regulatory layers of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

However, a common confusion lies in equating the protein structure prediction problem with the protein folding problem. The former provides a static structure, while the latter explains the dynamic folding pathway to that structure. We challenge the current status quo and advocate that AF2 has indeed learned some protein folding principles, despite being designed for structure prediction. AF2's high-dimensional parameters encode an imperfect biophysical scoring function. Typically, AF2 uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to guide the search within a narrow region of its learned surface. In our study, we operate AF2 without MSAs or initial templates, forcing it to sample its entire energy landscape - more akin to an ab initio approach. Among over 7,000 proteins, a fraction fold using sequence alone, highlighting the smoothness of AF2's learned energy surface. Additionally, by combining recycling and iterative predictions, we discover multiple AF2 intermediate structures in good agreement with known experimental data. AF2 appears to follow a ""local first, global later"" folding mechanism. For designed proteins with more optimized local interactions, AF2's energy landscape is too smooth to detect intermediates even when it should. Our current work sheds new light on what AF2 has learned and opens exciting possibilities to advance our understanding of protein folding and for experimental discovery of folding intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations.

Also, H5N1 infections in mammals across time showed a unique set of adaptations in the 2.3.4.4b clade compared to previously circulating strains, especially the acquisition of Q591 adaptation in PB2 that enables human adaptation.

Here, we determine the detailed 3D architecture of corpuscular components and reveal their contribution to touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for rapid adaptation and frequency tuning. Instead, these properties arise from the inner core, composed of gap junction-coupled lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs) surrounding the afferent terminal. By acting as additional touch sensing structures, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast-inactivating ion channels. We propose a model in which Pacinian corpuscle function is mediated by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Up to 70% of parasite-controlled changes in the host transcriptome rely on the MYR1 protein, which is required for the translocation of secreted proteins into the host cell. Mice infected with MYR1 knock-out (KO) strains survive infection, supporting a paramount function of MYR1-dependent secreted proteins in Toxoplasma virulence and proliferation. However, we have previously shown that MYR1 mutants have no growth defect in pooled in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screens in mice, suggesting that the presence of parasites that are wild-type at the myr1 locus in pooled screens can rescue the phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that MYR1 is not required for the survival in IFN-{gamma}-activated murine macrophages, and that parasites lacking MYR1 are able to expand during the onset of infection. While {Delta}MYR1 parasites have restricted growth in single-strain murine infections, we show that the phenotype is rescued by co-infection with wild-type (WT) parasites in vivo, independent of host functional adaptive immunity or key pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data show that the major function of MYR1-dependent secreted proteins is not to protect the parasite from clearance within infected cells. Instead, MYR-dependent proteins generate a permissive niche in a paracrine manner, which rescues {Delta}MYR1 parasites within a pool of CRISPR mutants in mice. Our results highlight an important limitation of otherwise powerful in vivo CRISPR screens and point towards key functions for MYR1-dependent Toxoplasma-host interactions beyond the infected cell.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPooled CRISPR screens are powerful tools to interrogate gene function in a high-throughput manner. Genes conferring fitness advantages or disadvantages upon disruption can be identified by sequencing. However, in Toxoplasma gondii pooled CRISPR screens in mice, fitness defects for some selected mutants drastically diverge from those observed in single-strain infections. Here, we show that a growth defect of a single Toxoplasma gene deletion mutant is rescued if co-infected with wildtype parasites. These results shine light on Toxoplasmas ability to subvert the host response beyond the infected cell, and highlight an important limitation of pooled CRISPR screens in mice. This limitation is probably encountered in CRISPR screens in general where paracrine effects occur.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Four AFP types have convergently evolved in several fish lineages. AFPs inhibit ice crystal growth and lower cellular freezing point. In lineages with AFPs, species inhabiting colder environments may possess more AFP copies. Elucidating how interspecific differences in AFP copy number evolve is challenging due to the genes' tandem array structure and consequently poor resolution of these repetitive regions. Here we explore the evolution of type III AFPs (AFP III) in the globally distributed suborder Zoarcoidei, leveraging six new long-read genome assemblies. Zoarcoidei has fewer genomic resources relative to other polar fish clades while it is one of the few groups of fishes adapted to both the Arctic and Southern Oceans. Combining these new assemblies with additional long-read genomes available for Zoarcoidei, we conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic test of AFP III evolution and modeled the effects of thermal habitat and depth on AFP III gene family evolution. We confirm a single origin of AFP III via neofunctionalization of the enzyme sialic acid synthase B and show that AFP gains and losses were not only correlated with temperature, but also with depth, which reduces freezing via pressure. Associations between the environment and AFP III copy number were driven by duplications of paralogs that were translocated out of the ancestral locus at which Zoarcoidei AFP arose. Our results reveal novel environmental effects on AFP evolution and demonstrate the value of high-quality genomic resources for studying how structural genomic variation shapes convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

However, it remains unclear whether they contribute to protein function or if they are merely happenstantial features that can easily be evolved away to achieve drug resistance. Here, we explore whether a cryptic pocket in the Interferon Inhibitory Domain (IID) of viral protein 35 (VP35) of Zaire ebolavirus has a functional role. We use simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding of the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston and Marburg. These homologs have structures nearly identical to Zaire but block different interferon pathways because Marburg IID only binds the backbone, while Zaire and Reston IIDs bind both backbone and blunt ends of dsRNA. We hypothesized that these differences arise from alterations in their pocket dynamics. Simulations and thiol-labeling experiments demonstrate that Reston has a lower probability of opening the cryptic pocket while Marburg has a higher probability than Zaire. Subsequent dsRNA-binding assays with different length substrates suggest that closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone. Further, a point mutation that increases the probability of cryptic pocket opening in Reston shows that the open states prefer backbone binding, while a substitution that lowers the probability of pocket opening in Zaire improves binding to blunt ends. These results demonstrate the cryptic pocket controls a functional tradeoff, suggesting cryptic pockets are under selective pressure and may be difficult to evolve away to achieve drug resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Most alphaviruses encode an opal (UGA) termination codon in nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) upstream of the viral polymerase, nsP4. The selective constraints underlying the conservation of the opal codon are poorly understood. Using primate and mosquito cells, we explored the role and selective pressure on the nsP3 opal codon through extensive mutational analysis in the prototype alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV). We found that the opal codon is highly favored over all other codons in primate cells under native 37{o}C growth conditions. However, this preference is diminished in mosquito and primate cells grown at a lower temperature. Thus, the primary determinant driving the selection of the opal stop codon is not host genetics but the passaging temperature. We show that the opal codon is preferred over amber and ochre termination codons because it results in the highest translational readthrough and polymerase production. However, substituting the opal codon with sense codons leads to excessive full-length polyprotein (P1234) production, which disrupts optimal nsP polyprotein processing, delays the switch from minus-strand to positive-strand RNA production, and significantly reduces SINV fitness at 37{degrees}C; this fitness defect is relieved at lower temperatures. A naturally occurring suppressor mutation unexpectedly compensates for a delayed transition from minus to genomic RNA production by also delaying the subsequent transition between genomic and sub-genomic RNA production. Our study reveals that the opal stop codon is the best solution for alphavirus replication at 37{o}C, producing enough nsP4 protein to maximize replication without disrupting nsP processing and RNA replication transitions needed for optimal fitness. Our study uncovers the intricate strategy dual-host alphaviruses use at a single codon to optimize fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Previous methods focused on higher heteroplasmy mutations that are limited in number and can be influenced by functional selection, introducing biases for lineage tracing. Although more challenging to detect, intermediate to low heteroplasmy mtDNA mutations are valuable due to their high diversity, abundance, and lower propensity to selection. To enhance mtDNA mutation detection and facilitate fine-scale lineage tracing, we developed the single-cell Regulatory multi-omics with Deep Mitochondrial mutation profiling (ReDeeM) approach, an integrated experimental and computational framework. Recently, some concerns have been raised about the analytical workflow in the ReDeeM framework. Specifically, it was noted that the mutations detected in a single molecule per cell are enriched on edges of mtDNA molecules, suggesting they resemble artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. It was then proposed that all mutations found in one molecule per cell should be removed. We detail our error correction method, demonstrating that the observed edge mutations are distinct from previously reported sequencing artifacts. We further show that the proposed removal leads to massive elimination of bona fide and informative mutations. Indeed, mutations accumulating on edges impact a minority of all mutation calls (for example, in hematopoietic stem cells, the excess mutations on the edge account for only 4.3%-7.6% of the total). Recognizing the value of addressing edge mutations even after applying consensus correction, we provide an additional filtering option in the ReDeeM-R package. This approach effectively eliminates the position biases, leads to a mutational signature indistinguishable from bona fide mitochondrial mutations, and removes excess low molecule high connectedness mutations. Importantly, this option preserves the large majority of unique mutations identified by ReDeeM, maintaining the ability of ReDeeM to provide a more than 10-fold increase in variant detection compared to previous methods. Additionally, the cells remain well-connected. While there is room for further refinement in mutation calling strategies, the significant advances and biological insights provided by the ReDeeM framework are unique and remain intact. We hope that this detailed discussion and analysis enables the community to employ this approach and contribute to its further development.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

However, while there is a plethora of robust protein expression protocols for E. coli, these methods are often unsuitable for high-throughput screening due to their significant resource and time consumption; these protocols are also susceptible to operator error and inconsistency.

To address these challenges, we have developed APEX, a robust and automated protocol for recombinant protein production in E. coli. APEX leverages the accessible, open-source Opentrons OT-2 platform to automate microbial handling and protein expression with high precision and repro-ducibility. APEX can be configured to perform heat shock transformation, colony selection, colony sampling, inoculation, subculturing and protein expression using a low-cost, minimal OT-2 hardware setup. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our automated transformation workflows using a variety of plasmids (2.7-17.7 kb), and exemplify the automated heterologous expression of a diverse array of proteins (27-222 kDa).

The permeability characteristics of the membrane determined several key functions of this network by determining which compounds could enter the compartment and which compounds could not. One key feature of known life is the utilisation of right-handed D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars and left-handed L- amino acid stereochemical isomers (enantiomers), however, it is not clear why life adopted this specific chirality. We previously demonstrated that an archaeal and an intermediate membrane mimic, bearing a mixture of bacterial and archaeal lipid characteristics (a  hybrid membrane), display increased permeability compared to bacterial-like membranes. Here, we investigate if these membranes can drive stereochemical selection on pentose sugars, hexose sugars and amino acids. Using permeability assays of homogenous unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that both membranes select for D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars while the hybrid membrane uniquely selects for a reduced alphabet of L- facing amino acids. This repertoire includes alanine, the plausible first L- amino acid utilised. We conclude such compartments could provide stereochemical compound selection thereby demonstrating a solution to the chirality problem during the evolution of life.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Here, we demonstrate that the RBP HNRNPA2B1 acts to keep specific RNAs out of neuronal projections. Using subcellular fractionation, high-throughput sequencing, and single molecule RNA FISH, we find that hundreds of RNAs demonstrate markedly increased abundance in neurites in HNRNPA2B1 knockout cells. These RNAs often encode motor proteins and are enriched for known HNRNPA2B1 binding sites and motifs in their 3' UTRs. The speed and processivity of microtubule-based transport is impaired in these cells, specifically in their neurites. HNRNPA2B1 point mutations that increase its cytoplasmic abundance relative to wildtype lead to stronger suppression of RNA mislocalization defects than seen with wildtype HNRNPA2B1. We further find that the subcellular localizations of HNRNPA2B1 target RNAs are sensitive to perturbations of RNA decay machinery, suggesting that it is HNRNPA2B1's known role in regulating RNA stability that may explain these observations. These findings establish HNRNPA2B1 as a negative regulator of neurite RNA abundance and link the subcellular activities of motor proteins with the subcellular abundance of the RNAs that encode them.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Recent work, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to induce virtual lesions, has illustrated a key role of the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) in the detection and resolution of perceptual ambiguities. Here, we sought to validate an active role of the IFC in conscious perception by evaluating how loss-of-function in patients with ischemic stroke in this region influences processing of ambiguous visual information. To this end, twenty-three patients (11 female, mean age 70.65 {+/-} 1.2 yrs) with chronic (>6 months), right-hemispheric ischemic stroke lesions within the MCA-territory (9 patients with IFC lesions, 14 without) performed a bistable perception task, having to report the perceived direction of rotation of an ambiguous random-dot-kinematogram (RDK). As hypothesized, patients with IFC lesions showed significantly fewer perceptual changes compared to patients without IFC lesions (IFC 44.9 {+/-} 46.3 s, non-IFC 28.2 {+/-} 37.1 s, T(182.9) = 3.1, p = 2.2 x 10-3). Importantly, this effect remained significant when controlling for age, sex, stroke severity and lesion volume (T(5.97) = -2.9, p =0.026). Our results support the notion that the IFC is crucial for resolving perceptual ambiguities, suggesting an active role of frontal cortex in shaping conscious visual experience.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

While rodent tissue has historically served as a source of these neurons, it has become increasingly clear that pain mechanisms in rodents and humans are substantially divergent. Sensory neurons harvested from cadaveric human tissue serve as a superior translational model for studying pain mechanisms, however their relative paucity limits their widespread utility. Theoretically, sensory neurons manufactured from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) could help bridge this translational gap given their relative abundance and potential similarity to primary human tissue. However, hPSC-derived sensory neurons manufactured with the most common methodologies correlate poorly to human tissue both transcriptionally and functionally. In the present work, we compare a novel population of hPSC-derived sensory neurons to previously published datasets and find this novel population to more closely resemble human primary dorsal root ganglia transcriptionally. Furthermore, we evaluate the heterogeneity of this novel population via single nucleus RNA sequencing and find it resembles specific nociceptor and mechanoreceptor subsets found in vivo. Finally, we assay the functionality of this population with high throughput automated patch clamp electrophysiology with respect to voltage-gated sodium (Nav) and potassium channels (Kv), and ligand-gated ionotropic GABA and P2X receptors. Overall, we find this population of hPSC-derived sensory neurons to be of relatively high fidelity, and suitable for interrogating numerous potential pain targets on a fully humanized platform.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

It has long been hypothesised that vesicles are directionally transported along phragmoplast microtubules by motor proteins. However, the mechanisms governing the accumulation and immobilisation of vesicles at the phragmoplast midzone remain elusive, and the motor protein responsible has yet to be identified. Here, we show that the plant-specific class II Kinesin-12 (Kinesin12-II) functions as a motor protein that drives vesicle transport towards the phragmoplast midzone in the moss Physcomitrium patens. In kinesin12-II mutants, the directional movement of cell plate materials towards the midzone and their retention were abolished, resulting in delayed cell plate formation and phragmoplast disassembly. A macroscopic phenotype arising from Kinesin12-II disruption was the impediment to gametophore development. We showed that this defect was attributable to the production of aneuploid cells in the early gametophore, where chromosome missegregation occurred because of the incomplete disassembly of phragmoplast microtubules in the preceding cell cycle. These findings suggest that plant Kinesin-12 has evolved to acquire a unique and critical function that facilitates cell plate formation in the presence of phragmoplasts.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Binding of host receptor CD4 to Env results in conformational changes that allow interaction with a host co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4). Further conformational rearrangements result in an elongated pre-hairpin intermediate structure in which Env is anchored to the viral membrane by its transmembrane region and to the host cell membrane by its fusion peptide. Although budding virions can be readily imaged by electron tomography (ET) of HIV-1-infected tissues and cultured cells, virions that are fusing (attached to host cells via pre-hairpin intermediates) are not normally visualized, perhaps because the process of membrane fusion is too fast to capture by EM. To image virions during fusion, we used fusion inhibitors to prevent downstream conformational changes in Env that lead to membrane fusion, thereby trapping HIV-1 virions linked to target cells by prehairpin intermediates. ET of HIV-1 pseudovirions bound to CD4+/CCR5+ TZM-bl cells revealed presumptive pre-hairpin intermediates as 2-4 narrow spokes linking a virion to the cell surface. To extend these results to a more physiological setting, we used ET to image tissues and organs derived from humanized bone marrow, liver, thymus (BLT) mice infected with HIV-1 and then treated with CPT31, a high-affinity D-peptide fusion inhibitor linked to cholesterol. Trapped HIV-1 virions were found in all tissues studied (small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow), and spokes representing pre-hairpin intermediates linking trapped virions to cell surfaces were similar in structure and number to those seen in the previous pseudovirus and cultured cell ET study.

IMPORTANCETrapped and untrapped HIV-1 virions, both mature and immature, were distinguished by localizing spokes via 3D tomographic reconstructions of HIV-1 infected and fusion-inhibitor treated tissues of humanized mice. The finding of trapped HIV-1 virions in all tissues examined demonstrates a wide distribution of the CPT31 inhibitor, a desirable property for a potential therapeutic. In addition, the presence of virions trapped by spokes, particularly in vascular endothelial cells, demonstrates that fusion inhibitors can be used as markers for potential HIV-1-target cells within tissues, facilitating the mapping of HIV-1 target cells within the complex cellular milieu of infected tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

We conducted an international cross-sectional survey study between August and October 2022, examining the experiences and perceptions of HCWs clinically involved with the 2022 mpox response. Respondents were recruited via an international network of sexual health and HIV clinicians responding to mpox and promoted through clinical associations and social media. Survey domains included: clinical workload; preparedness; training and support at work; psychological well-being and vaccination. 725 multi-national healthcare workers across 41 countries were included in the analysis. 91% were physicians specialised in Sexual Health or Infectious Diseases; with 34% (n=247) of all respondents involved in mpox policy. A substantial proportion of respondents (n=296, 41%) reported working longer hours during the mpox outbreak, with no concomitant removal of other clinical responsibilities. 30% (n=218) of respondents reported that they had never heard of mpox before the outbreak and over 25% of the respondents reported that they had misdiagnosed someone initially. This culminated in a high prevalence of moral distress at 30%. Less than 9% of HCWs in the region of the Caribbean, Central America and South America had been offered a vaccine as compared to almost 1/3 in the other regions. Where offered, there were high levels of uptake across all regions. Our findings highlight a critical need for addressing the profound gaps in HCW knowledge about re-emerging diseases with pandemic potential. Strengthening the resilience of global health systems and prioritising internationally coordinated approaches to global vaccine deployment is imperative.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474600

However, circulation in bats showed molecular divergence from H17N10 (Guatemala) and H18N11 (Peru), and they were designated as new subtypes. The study aimed to characterize the influenza A virus detected in the fishing bat Noctilio albiventris. A surveillance study of pathogens of public health interest was carried out; rectal samples were taken from four fishing bats (N. albiventris) captured in Talaigua Nuevo, Bolivar, Colombia. The samples were sequenced by NGS using DNBseq (MGI-G50) and analyzed with bioinformatics tools. Eight viral contigs associated with the Orthomyxoviridae family were obtained. The identified segments showed around 90% similarity with H18N11, except for the neuraminidase (N). The phylogenetic analysis of the N protein showed the appearance of a basal branch to the N11 subtype, and the molecular clock indicates that it does not share a recent common ancestor. 3D modeling indicates that the N protein of N. albiventris presents three mutations (K363R, T242K, and I139V) near the hypothetical active site of the protein. These mutations potentially increase the interaction with the HLA-DR of bats, which could have significant implications for the virus's behavior. The phylogenetic, evolutionary, and antigenic divergence of the N protein of N. albiventris suggests a new subtype called H18N12. Its role as a pathogen must be studied.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Here, we report full-length cryo-EM structures of UapA in new inward-facing apo- and substrate-loaded conformations at 2.05-3.5 A in detergent and lipid nanodiscs. The structures reveal in an unprecedented level of detail the role of water molecules and lipids in substrate binding, specificity, dimerization, and activity, rationalizing accumulated functional data. Unexpectedly, the N-tail is structured and interacts with both the core and scaffold domains. This finding, combined with mutational and functional studies and MD, points out how N-tail interactions couple proper subcellular trafficking and transport activity by wrapping UapA in a conformation necessary for ER-exit and but also critical for elevator-type conformational changes associated with substrate translocation once UapA has integrated into the plasma membrane. Our study provides detailed insights into important aspects of the elevator-type transport mechanism and opens novel issues on how the evolution of extended cytosolic tails in eukaryotic transporters, apparently needed for subcellular trafficking, might have been integrated into the transport mechanism.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Diffusive generation of latent molecular encodings, rather than direct diffusive generation of molecular structures, offers an appealing way to handle the small and mismatched datasets that are common for molecular properties. We benchmark various diffusion guidance schemes and sampling methods against a pre-trained autoregressive transformer and genetic algorithms to evaluate control over potency, expert preference, and various physicochemical properties. We show that conditional diffusion allows control over the properties of generated molecules, with practical and performance advantages over competing methods. We also apply the recently introduced idea of particle guidance to enhance sample diversity.

Combined with reverse transcription-droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) detection, the method provides a fast and sensitive method for measuring viral RNA concentrations in wastewater. The method was used to measure the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in daily samples of wastewater entering a major metropolitan wastewater treatment plant over the course of 32 months, from November 2020 through June 2023. In addition, targeted mutation assays were used with RT-ddPCR to characterize the evolving presence and prevalence of specific SARS-CoV-2 variant sub-lineages in the wastewater stream over time. The results demonstrate the utility of these methods to accurately measure the total load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and chronicle its evolving variant composition, in wastewater treatment plant influent, providing near-real-time characterization of COVID-19 disease prevalence and trends in the served community.

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

During REM sleep, the brains internal representation of direction keeps shifting like that of an awake animal moving through its environment6-8. What causes these shifts, given the immobility of the sleeping animal? Here we show that the superior colliculus of the mouse, a motor command center involved in orienting movements9-15, issues motor commands during REM sleep, e.g. turn left, that are similar to those issued in the awake behaving animal. Strikingly, these motor commands, despite not being executed, shift the internal representation of direction as if the animal had turned. Thus, during REM sleep, the brain simulates actions by issuing motor commands that, while not executed, have consequences as if they had been. This study suggests that the sleeping brain, while disengaged from the external world, uses its internal model of the world to simulate interactions with it.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

The current study examines whether processing in working memory, specifically attentional prioritization (Experiments 1 and 2) and testing (Experiment 2), can enhance the retrieval of recently encoded long-term memories. Eighty-six participants completed a three-phase task across two experiments. In the first phase, they learned object-location associations. In the second phase, using a retro-cue paradigm, these pairs reappeared with either informative (Experiments 1 and 2) or uninformative (Experiment 2) cues for a subsequent match-no-match test. In the final retrieval phase, participants recalled the locations associated with each object. Behavioral performance and electroencephalogram data recorded during this final retrieval phase of Experiment 1 revealed that attentional prioritization improved long-term memory retrieval. Experiment 2 indicated that prioritization and testing jointly enhance retrieval. These findings suggest that working memory does not only serve as a temporary store but has the capacity to actively strengthen long-term memory representations.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Although significant advances in genome technology have been made with the development of bead-based SNP genotyping and Genome Studio software, some SNPs still fail to be genotyped, resulting in ""nocalls"" that impede downstream analyses. To recover these genotypes, we introduce Cluster Buster, a genotyping neural network and visual inspection system designed to improve the quality of neurodegenerative disease (NDD) research. Concordance analysis with whole genome sequencing (WGS) and imputed genotypes validated the reliability of predicted genotypes, with dozens of high-performing SNPs across LRRK2, APOE, and GBA loci achieving at least 90% concordance per SNP location. Further analysis of concordance between Genome Studio genotypes and imputed and WGS genotypes revealed discrepancies between the genotyping technologies, highlighting the need for selective application of Cluster Buster on SNP locations based on concordance rates. Cluster Buster's implementation significantly reduces manual labor for recovering no-call SNPs, refining genotype quality for the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2). This system facilitates better imputation and GWAS outcomes, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of genetic factors in NDDs.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

Here, we investigate the cellular evolution of the hypothalamic medial preoptic area (MPOA), a brain region that plays a critical role in social behavior, across two sister species of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus and P. polionotus) with divergent social systems. These two species exhibit large differences in mating and parental care behavior across species and sex. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we build a cellular atlas of the MPOA for males and females of both Peromyscus species. We identify four cell types that are differentially abundant across species, two of which may account for species differences in parental care behavior. Our data further implicate two sex-biased cell types to be important for the evolution of sex-specific behavior. Finally, we show a remarkable reduction of sex-biased gene expression in P. polionotus, a monogamous species that also exhibits reduced sexual dimorphism in parental care behavior. Our MPOA atlas is a powerful resource to investigate how molecular neuronal traits may be evolving to give rise to innate differences in social behavior across animal species.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474600

The RNA velocity framework utilizes both spliced and unspliced reads in single cell mRNA preparations to predict future cellular states and estimate transcriptional kinetics. However, current models assume either constant kinetic rates, rates equal for all genes, or rates completely independent of progression through differentiation. Consequently, current models for rate estimation are either underparametrised or overparametrised. Here we developed a new method (diffGEK) which overcomes this issue, and allows comparison of transcriptional rates across different biological conditions. diffGEK assumes that rates can vary over a trajectory, but are smooth functions of the differentiation process. Analysing Jak2 V617F mutant versus wild type mice for erythropoiesis, and Ezh2 KO versus wild type mice in myelopoiesis, revealed which genes show altered transcription, splicing or degradation rates between different conditions. Moreover, we observed that, for some genes, compensatory changes between different rates can result in comparable overall mRNA levels, thereby masking highly dynamic changes in gene expression kinetics in conventional expression analysis. Collectively, we report a robust pipeline for comparative expression analysis based on altered transcriptional kinetics to discover mechanistic differences missed by conventional approaches, with broad applicability across any biomedical research question where single cell expression data are available for both wild type and treatment/mutant conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

The roles of IDRs and APRs in CHD function has remained elusive.

We generated a comprehensive map of CHD1-9-specific binding proteins, revealing dozens of novel interactions with transcription regulators.

To maintain the infection cycle, soil phages must travel from one suitable host to the next. However, traversing the soil matrix presents a dangerous journey for phages, which need to encounter the right hosts in this spatially complex habitat, but are not capable of active motion and can adsorb to soil particles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that bacterial-feeding nematodes (roundworms) present a reliable vehicle of soil transport for phages. First, we demonstrated that the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans vectored the laboratory model phage T7 as well as the soil phage {Phi} Ppu-W11 on agar. Sorption assays carried out with paralyzed and non-paralyzed nematodes showed that phage transport can occur via both external cuticular attachment and ingestion, and that the presence of host bacteria is not required for phage vectoring. Finally, we designed a microcosm to test phage transfer in compost and sandy soil using C. elegans and its sister species, C. remanei, respectively. This experiment confirmed that nematodes also enable phage movement through complex spatial habitats. This novel mechanism of phage vectoring extends our understanding of virus transmission in soil, revealing new multitrophic interactions that may influence soil functioning.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Our simulations suggest that there is a mismatch between the timescales of coral reef decline and range expansion under future predicted climate change. Whereas the most severe declines in coral cover will likely occur within 60-80 years, significant tropical coral range expansion requires centuries.

Academic publishers are adapting to the transformative role of AI chatbots in producing or facilitating scientific research. This study aimed to examine the policies established by scientific, technical, and medical academic publishers for defining and regulating the responsible authors use of AI chatbots.

MethodsThis study performed a cross-sectional audit on the publicly available policies of 163 academic publishers, indexed as members of the International Association of the Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM). Data extraction of publicly available policies on the webpages of all STM academic publishers was performed independently in duplicate with content analysis reviewed by a third contributor (September 2023 - December 2023). Data was categorized into policy elements, such as  proofreading and  image generation. Counts and percentages of  yes (i.e., permitted),  no, and  N/A were established for each policy element.

ResultsA total of 56/163 (34.4%) STM academic publishers had a publicly available policy guiding the authors use of AI chatbots. No policy allowed authorship accreditations for AI chatbots (or other generative technology). Most (49/56 or 87.5%) required specific disclosure of AI chatbot use. Four policies/publishers placed a complete ban on the use of AI tools by authors.

ConclusionsOnly a third of STM academic publishers had publicly available policies as of December 2023. A re-examination of all STM members in 12-18 months may uncover evolving approaches toward AI chatbot use with more academic publishers having a policy.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601

However, how this coupling is regulated, whether it mediates waste clearance, and why fluid flux is impaired in disease status remain unclear. Here we show that vascular-CSF coupling correlates with cortical cholinergic activity in non-demented aged humans. The causal role of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that project to the cortex is then verified by specific lesioning in mice, revealing correlated changes in vascular-CSF coupling, arterial pulsation and glymphatic flux, which can be altered by an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. These results suggest a neurovascular mechanism by which CSF/glymphatic flux is modulated by cholinergic neuronal activity, thereby providing a conceptual basis for the development of diagnostics and treatments for glymphatic dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

However, the mechanisms underlying these differential H3K27me3 levels remain elusive. Because H3K27me3 levels are diluted two- fold in every round of replication and then restored through the rest of the cell cycle, we reasoned that the cell cycle length could be a key regulator of total H3K27me3 levels. Here, we propose that a fast cell cycle restricts H3K27me3 levels in stem cells. To test this model, we determined changes to H3K27me3 levels in mESCs globally and at specific loci upon G1 phase lengthening accomplished by thymidine block or growth in the absence of serum (with the ""2i medium""). H3K27me3 levels in mESC increase with G1 arrest when grown in serum and in 2i medium. Additionally, we observed via CUT&RUN and ChIP-seq that regions that gain H3K27me3 in G1 arrest and 2i media overlap, supporting our model of cell cycle length as a critical regulator of the stem cell epigenome and cellular identity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inverse effect, that G1 shortening in differentiated cells results in a loss of H3K27me3 levels. Finally, in tumor cells with extreme H3K27me3 loss, lengthening of the G1 phase leads to H3K27me3 recovery despite the presence of the dominant negative, sub-stoichiometric H3.1K27M mutation.

Unfortunately, this technique has remained largely inaccessible at 7T, due to prohibitive cross-modal interference effects and physical constraints. Here, we developed a first-of-its-kind EEG-fMRI acquisition framework on a clinical 7T system combining key improvements from previous works: compact EEG transmission chain to reduce artifact incidence, reference sensors for artifact correction, and adapted leads for compatibility with a dense radiofrequency receive-array allowing state-of-the-art fMRI sensitivity and acceleration. Two implementations were tested: one using an EEG cap adapted in-house, and another using a recently-designed prototype from an industrial manufacturer, intended to be further developed into a commercial product accessible to the broader community. A comprehensive evaluation in humans showed that simultaneous acquisitions, including with sub-millimeter fMRI resolution, could be conducted without detectable safety issues or major practical constraints. The EEG exerted relatively mild perturbations on fMRI quality (6-11% loss in temporal SNR), without measurably affecting the detection of resting-state networks and visual responses. The artifacts induced on EEG could be corrected to a degree where the spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics were comparable to outside recordings, and hallmark features such as resting-state alpha and eyes-closing alpha modulation could be clearly detected. Altogether, these findings indicate excellent prospects for neuroimaging applications, that can leverage the unique possibilities achievable at 7T.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Today, the A-allele occurs with an average frequency of 5% in Europe.

MethodsThis study comprised 251 ancient genomes from Europe spanning over 14,000 years. In these samples, the investigation focused on admixture informed analyses and selection scans of rs11209026-A and its haplotypes.

Findingsrs11209026-A was found at high frequencies in Anatolian Farmers (AF, 18%) where it was likely under weak positive selection. AF later introduced the allele into the ancient European gene-pool. Subsequent admixture caused its frequency to decrease and formed the current southwest-to-northeast allele frequency cline in Europe. The geographic distribution of rs11209026-A may influence the gradient in IBD incidence rates that are highest in northern and eastern Europe.

InterpretationGiven the dramatic changes from hunting and gathering to agriculture during the Neolithic, AF might have been exposed to selective pressures from a pro-inflammatory lifestyle and diet. Therefore, the protective A-allele may have increased survival by reducing intestinal inflammation and microbiome dysbiosis. The adaptively evolved function of the variant likely contributes to the high efficacy and low side-effects of modern IL-23 neutralization therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases. This study highlights how evolutionary informed research can provide promising targets for new therapeutic strategies.

Over the last two decades, ART-R has spread widely across Southeast Asia, compromising public health strategies and hindering elimination efforts. As of 2024, ART-R has now emerged in East Africa, with the potential to dramatically increase human mortality in the region. Mitigating the spread of ART-R requires detailed genomic surveillance of point mutations in the kelch13 gene, the primary determinant of resistance to artemisinin derivatives. Although extensive surveillance data on these markers is available, it is distributed across many literature studies and open databases. In this literature review, we aggregate publicly available spatiotemporal data for 112,933 P. falciparum samples between 1980 - 2023 into a single resource, providing the most comprehensive overview of kelch13 markers to date. By synthesising insights from these samples over a global scale, we outline the history and current status of kelch13 mutations associated with ART-R, with particular reference to their emergence in Southeast Asia and recent emergence in East and Northeast Africa. Concerningly, we find their recent increases in frequency in these areas of Africa are comparable to those observed in Southeast Asia 10-15 years ago. We review several factors that may influence the spread of ART-R going forwards, such as fitness costs, treatment strategies, and local epidemiological dynamics, before articulating possible scenarios on how resistance may spread in Africa in coming years. In summary, this review provides a unified, comprehensive account of how the situation of ART-R has unfolded globally so far, highlighting insights both for researchers in the field and public health bodies which aim to reduce its negative effects. More broadly, we highlight the critical role genomic surveillance has had, and will continue to have in combating the spread of ART-R.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

MethodsIn a retrospective cohort, using Poisson regression adjusting for sociodemographic variables and month of infection, we examined associations between individual non-lineage defining mutations and SARS-CoV-2 immunity status, defined as a) no prior recorded infection, b) not vaccinated but with at least one prior recorded infection, c) complete primary series vaccination, and/or d) primary series vaccination and [&ge;] 1 booster. We identified all non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions in SARS-CoV-2 genomes with [&ge;]5% allelic frequency and population frequency of [&ge;]5% and [&le;]95%. We also examined correlations between the presence of SNPs with each other, with subvariants, and over time.

ResultsSeventy-nine mutations met inclusion criteria. Among 15,566 persons infected with Omicron SARS-CoV-2, 1,825 (12%) were unvaccinated with no prior recorded infection, 360 (2%) were unvaccinated with a recorded prior infection, 13,381 (86%) had a complete primary series vaccination, and 9,172 (58%) had at least one booster. After examining correlation between SNPs, 79 individual non-lineage defining mutations were organized into 38 groups. After correction for multiple testing, no individual SNPs or SNP groups were significantly associated with immunity status levels.

ConclusionsGenomic variation identified within SARS-CoV-2 Omicron specimens was not significantly associated with immunity status, suggesting that contribution of non-lineage defining SNPs to immune evasion is minimal. Larger-scale surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomes linked with clinical data can help provide information to inform future vaccine development.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601

Whether people without severe disease can also develop strong neutralizing responses to infection, and the pathways involved, is less clear. We performed a proteomic analysis on sera from 71 individuals infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, enrolled during the first South African infection wave. We determined disease severity by whether participants required supplemental oxygen and measured neutralizing antibody levels at convalescence. High neutralizing antibodies were associated with high disease severity, yet 40% of participants with lower disease severity had neutralizing antibody levels comparable to those with severe disease. We found 130 differentially expressed proteins between high and low neutralizers and 40 between people with high versus low disease severity. Five proteins overlapped, including furin, a protease which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. High neutralizers with non-severe disease had similar levels of differentially expressed neutralization response proteins to high neutralizers with severe disease, yet similar levels of differentially expressed disease severity proteins to participants with non-severe disease. Furthermore, we could reasonably predict who developed a strong neutralizing response based on a single protein, HSPA8, involved in clathrin pit uncoating. These results indicate that a strong antibody response does not always require severe disease and may involve different pathways.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601

We investigated how acute enhancer-driven activation affects neighboring non-target genes within the same TAD. Using single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), we tracked the transcription of TFF1 (enhancer-targeted) and TFF3 (non-targeted) during estrogen stimulation. We observed mutually exclusive expression patterns: TFF1 expression peaked at 1 hour, while TFF3 reached its peak at 3 hours, after TFF1s activation had diminished. Chromatin looping data indicated that the enhancer loops with TFF1 but not TFF3, suggesting that TFF3 upregulation is not due to direct enhancer-promoter interactions. CRISPR deletion of the TFF1enhancer and 1,6-hexanediol (HD) exposure revealed that the TFF1 enhancer:promoter undergo Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS), which sequesters the transcriptional machinery and inhibits TFF3 expression. As estrogen signaling wanes or LLPS is disrupted, TFF1 expression declines while TFF3 expression increases. Our findings reveal that enhancer-driven activation can indirectly influence neighboring genes, highlighting a dynamic shift in gene expression as signaling progresses.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Here, we couple single-cell analysis technologies with soluble lectins and chemical probes to interrogate glycosylation patterns on major T cell populations across multiple mouse and human tissues. Our analysis focused on terminal glycan epitopes with immunomodulatory functions, including sialoglycan ligands for Siglecs. We demonstrate that glycosylation patterns are diverse across the resting murine T cell repertoire and dynamically remodelled in response to antigen-specific stimulation. Surprisingly, we find that human T cell populations do not share the same glycoprofiles or glycan remodelling dynamics as their murine counterparts. We show that these differences can be explained by divergent regulation of glycan biosynthesis pathways between the species. These results highlight fundamental glycophysiological differences between mouse and human T cells and reveal features that are critical to consider for glycan-targeted therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Distinct cancers harbor mutations in specific subunits, altering the chromatin landscape, such as the PBAF-specific component ARID2 in melanoma. Here, we performed comprehensive epigenomic profiling of SWI/SNF complexes and their associated chromatin states in melanoma and melanocytes and uncovered a subset of PBAF-exclusive regions that coexist with PRC2 and repressive chromatin. Time-resolved approaches revealed that PBAF regions are generally less sensitive to ATPase-mediated remodeling than BAF sites. Moreover, PBAF/PRC2-bound loci are enriched for REST, a transcription factor that represses neuronal genes. In turn, absence of ARID2 and consequent PBAF complex disruption hinders the ability of REST to bind and inactivate its targets, leading to upregulation of synaptic transcripts. Remarkably, this gene signature is conserved in melanoma patients with ARID2 mutations. In sum, we demonstrate a unique role for PBAF in generating accessibility for a silencing transcription factor at repressed chromatin, with important implications for disease.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

A fundamental role of head direction cells is to provide input to MEC grid cells, which are thought to translate information about head direction into a metric code for spatial location. However, classic anatomical studies indicate that most thalamic HD projections pass indirectly to the MEC via the post- and para-subiculum, with only a small subset of ADN fibers terminating in the MEC. To further investigate the smaller and direct projection to the MEC, we use rabies-mediated retrograde tracing in mice to determine if this projection explicitly targets a subset of MEC neurons. Our findings reveal that ADN neurons specifically project onto MEC interneurons, with a preference for MEC VIP-expressing cells. Additionally, MEC VIP cells receive input from the hippocampus, the subicular complex, and the retrosplenial cortex - key centers for spatial memory - suggesting a specialized role for MEC VIP cells in spatial memory. Indeed, we find that MEC VIP cells exhibit increased c-Fos expression in a spatial memory task and show that chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons impairs task performance. Together, these data uncover a specific projection of head direction information onto MEC interneurons and confirm that MEC VIP-expressing cells are critical for spatial memory.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Here, we develop a low-cost solvent-free approach based on silanized silica particles to fill the technology gap. We determine the feasibility and specificity of three differently coated (C11, C16, C18) silica particles to extract nine terpenoid metabolites from C. reinhardtii cultures during cultivation. The results reveal that the extraction efficiencies of functionalized particles, particularly those coated with C18, demonstrated high potential as an alternative to traditional extraction methods. While the extraction efficiencies of coated microparticles are for most compounds lower than those observed for dodecane-based extractions, it holds higher potential for larger-scale cultivations where the use of dodecane is restricted due to its flammability and tendency to form emulsions. In addition, the present study provides insights into the optimization of particle-to-culture volume ratio, particle saturation, and the required number of product elution steps, and proves the feasibility of an upscaled extraction of the sesquiterpenoid patchoulol as a representative metabolite in 5 L hanging bag reactors. This study paves the way for a circular bioprocess where product capture with traditional solvent overlays is impractical due to the formation of emulsions, and at the same time allows for an easy product recovery (solid-liquid separation) and reuse of functionalized particles over numerous cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Multiple p-tau biomarkers on several analytical platforms are poised for clinical use. The Alzheimers Association Global Biomarker Standardisation Consortium plasma phospho-tau Round Robin study engaged assay developers in a blinded case-control study on plasma p-tau, aiming to learn which assays provide the largest fold-changes in AD compared to non-AD, have the strongest relationship between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and show the most consistent relationships between methods (commutability) in measuring both patient samples and candidate reference materials (CRM).

METHODSThirty-three different p-tau biomarker assays, built on eight different analytical platforms, were used to quantify paired plasma and CSF samples from 40 participants. AD biomarker status was categorised as ""AD pathology"" (n=25) and ""non-AD pathology"" (n=15) by CSF A{beta}42/A{beta}40 (US-FDA; CE-IVDR) and p-tau181 (CE-IVDR) methods. The commutability of four CRM, at three concentrations, was assessed across assays.

FINDINGSPlasma p-tau217 consistently demonstrated higher fold-changes between AD and non-AD pathology groups, compared to other p-tau epitopes. Fujirebio LUMIPULSE G, UGOT IPMS, and Lilly MSD p-tau217 assays provided the highest median fold-changes. In CSF, p-tau217 assays also performed best, and exhibited substantially larger fold-changes than their plasma counterparts, despite similar diagnostic performance. P-tau217 showed the strongest correlations between plasma assays (rho=0.81 to 0.97). Plasma p-tau levels were weakly-to-moderately correlated with CSF p-tau, and correlations were non-significant within the AD group alone. The evaluated CRM were not commutable across assays.

INTERPRETATIONPlasma p-tau217 measures had larger fold-changes and discriminative accuracies for detecting AD pathology, and better agreement across platforms than other plasma p-tau variants. Plasma and CSF markers of p-tau, measured by immunoassays, are not substantially correlated, questioning the interchangeability of their continuous relationship. Further work is warranted to understand the pathophysiology underlying this dissociation, and to develop suitable reference materials facilitating cross-assay standardisation.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPhosphorylated tau (p-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid is an established biomarker of Alzheimers disease (AD), and several studies of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers now show evidence for its diagnostic accuracy in AD. We reviewed the literature on plasma p-tau in AD by searching without language restrictions in PubMed for articles from 1st January 2014 to 1st March 2024 using the terms (((""Alzheimer Disease""[Mesh]) OR ((Alzheimer[Title/Abstract]) OR (Alzheimers [Title/Abstract))) AND (((""Blood""[Mesh]) OR (""Plasma""[Mesh])) OR (plasma[Title/Abstract]))) AND ((phospho tau[Title/Abstract]) OR (phosphorylated tau[Title/Abstract]) OR (p-tau[Title/Abstract]) OR (P-tau[Title/Abstract]) OR (pTau[Title/Abstract])), filtering for studies in humans. Several studies examined plasma p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 in well-characterised research cohorts including cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy when utilising CSF or amyloid PET imaging ""gold standard"" biomarkers, and in relation to post-mortem amyloid and tau pathology. Most studies utilised single-method assays to measure biomarkers of interest, including immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry and a variety of immunochemical methods including single molecule array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, electrochemiluminescence, and immunomagnetic reduction. Some later studies have performed cross-method and cross-phospho-form comparisons (p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231), including six single molecular array assays in the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort, nine assays in the BIODEGMAR memory clinic-based cohort from Spain, ten assays in individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the Sk[a]ne University memory clinic cohort from Sweden, and have generally reported the various individual methods for p-tau217 to have the highest diagnostic accuracy for the presence of cerebral {beta}-amyloid deposition. No study to date has compared assays for p-tau217 on semi- and fully automated platforms, described comparisons with p-tau212 and p-tau205 in plasma, or assessed commutability of candidate reference materials between assays in comparison to patient samples.

Added value of this studyOur study included the largest number of methods for assaying plasma p-tau to date, with engagement from 12 assay developers, allowing for blinded cross-assay comparisons of 33 plasma assays (for p-tau181, p-tau205, p-tau212, p-tau217, and p-tau231). Among these were included several semi-automated and fully automated methods that have potential for widespread clinical application. This is also the first study, to our knowledge, in which the commutability of candidate reference materials was assessed for plasma p-tau, as a first step in efforts to standardise between assays. The study design capitalised on a large volume of paired CSF and plasma drawn from well-characterised attenders to a specialist cognitive disorders service, allowing for 26 intra-method comparisons between CSF and plasma measurements within the same individuals. We found that CSF p-tau217 assays consistently outperformed other CSF p-tau assays in terms of fold-change between individuals with and without Alzheimers pathology, and the top ten assays in terms of fold change in plasma were also p-tau217 assays. This high discriminative value of plasma p-tau217 contrasted with overall only moderate correlations between CSF and plasma within individuals, which did not persist within the AD group alone. We also did not observe commutability of the four types of candidate reference materials we investigated, for any of the assay pairs.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study adds to the growing evidence for plasma p-tau217 as a candidate biomarker for translation into clinical practice by virtue of its superior discriminative ability between AD vs non-AD in symptomatic individuals, when compared head-to-head with other phosphorylated tau forms. The observed high and clinically interpretable fold-changes are pivotal for this biomarkers possible future success. Further studies should examine whether blood biomarker-supported diagnosis will extend access to disease-specific (and potentially disease-modifying) treatments and impact patient-relevant outcomes such as quality of life, particularly in diverse and resource-limited settings. Standardization between different assays will also be important for real-world applications, and this will require further concerted efforts in developing reference materials.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of singing on cardiovascular biomarkers in an aging population with coronary artery disease.

MethodsParticipants had three study visits separated by 2-7 days, according to a randomized, single-blind, cross-over, controlled design: (1) a 30-minute period of coached singing from an in-person music therapist, (2) a 30-minute period of singing along to an instructional video and (3) a 30-minute rest (control). Primary outcomes included macrovascular endothelial function assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and microvascular function assessed by peripheral arterial tonometry (Framingham reactive hyperemia index; fRHI). Heart rate variability was a secondary outcome.

ResultsSixty-five subjects (mean age 67.7{+/-} 0.8, 40% women) completed the study. Compared to control, there was an increase in fRHI for the singing video intervention (estimate 0.54, SE 0.25, p=0.005) but not for the coaching intervention (estimate 0.11, SE 0.18, p=0.570). There was no change in macrovascular function with either intervention. The low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio increased by 2.80 (SE 1.03, p=0.008), and the LnHF power decreased by -0.90 ms2 (SE 0.29, p=0.003) with the video (during to pre-change). When assessing post- to pre- change, the coaching intervention showed a significant change of -0.62 ms2 (SE 0.29, p=0.036) in LnHF power.

ConclusionsSinging along to an instructional video for 30 minutes improved microvascular, but not macrovascular, endothelial function, in older patients with CAD. HRV changes with singing are similar to that of exercise.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601

This hypermethylation was linked to decreased expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses and glycolytic metabolism, and the inactivation of transcription factors that regulate microglial responses to environmental stimuli. Prolonged exposure of human primary microglia to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) inhibited TET-mediated 5mC oxidation, resulting in a reduced accumulation of global 5hmC levels. We confirmed high 5mC/5hmC ratios at lineage-specific enhancers, by analyzing CpGs at single-base resolution. D-2HG-treated microglia show reduced proinflammatory capacity and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, consistent with the remodeled enhancer landscape. Conversely, depletion of D-2HG following treatment of a glioma patient with an IDH mutant inhibitor was associated with enhanced microglial responses, as assessed by snRNA-seq. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the hyporesponsive state of microglia in IDHmut gliomas and support the concept that oncometabolites may disrupt the function of immune cells residing in the tumor microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

With the recent approval of multiple RSV-targeted pharmacological interventions, there is an increased demand for efficient, high-throughput sequencing methods to monitor RSV genetic diversity and the potential impact of these interventions. Here we introduce two novel amplicon-based sequencing schemes designed for the RSV A and B subtypes, optimized for integration with widespread existing ARTIC sequencing workflows. Here we show that this primers schemes can produce high quality genomes from RSV samples across the globe, with eight laboratories in five countries producing complete genomes on both Nanopore and Illumina sequencing platforms. Furthermore, these results provide a snapshot of circulating diversity of RSV. Phylogenetic analysis suggests only minimal geographic clustering of sequences but highlights distinct lineage dynamics between RSV A and B seen across the 882 samples sequenced for this study. The ability to effectively multiplex these RSV A and B primer schemes, enables streamlined, high-throughput sequencing without prior subtyping. This study represents an advancement in RSV genomics, providing robust tools for global sequencing efforts aimed at tracking RSV evolution and assessing the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions rapidly and at scale.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Besides the CTCF/cohesin machinery, only a few nuclear factors have been studied for a direct role in physically connecting regulatory elements. Here, we show via acute degradation experiments that LDB1 directly and broadly promotes enhancer-promoter loops. Most LDB1-mediated contacts, even those spanning hundreds of kb, can form in the absence of CTCF, cohesin, or YY1 as determined via the use of multiple degron systems. Moreover, an engineered LDB1-driven chromatin loop is cohesin independent. Cohesin-driven loop extrusion does not stall at LDB1 occupied sites but may aid the formation of a subset of LDB1 anchored loops. Leveraging the dynamic reorganization of nuclear architecture during the transition from mitosis to G1-phase, we establish a relationship between LDB1-dependent interactions in the context of TAD organization and gene activation. Lastly, Tri-C and Region Capture Micro-C reveal that LDB1 organizes multi-enhancer networks to activate transcription.

These compounds have applications in medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. Their production is encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), groups of genes collectively directing their biosynthesis. The advent of metagenomics has allowed researchers to study BGCs directly from environmental samples, identifying numerous previously unknown BGCs encoding unprecedented chemistry. Here, we present the BGC Atlas (bgc-atlas.cs.uni-tuebingen.de), a web resource that facilitates the exploration and analysis of BGC diversity in metagenomes. The BGC Atlas identifies and clusters BGCs from publicly available datasets, offering a centralized database and a web interface for metadata-aware exploration of BGCs and gene cluster families (GCFs). We analyzed over 35,000 datasets from MGnify, identifying nearly 1.8 million BGCs, which were clustered into GCFs. The analysis showed that ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are the most abundant compound class, with most GCFs exhibiting high environmental specificity. We believe that our tool will enable researchers to easily explore and analyze the BGC diversity in environmental samples, significantly enhancing our understanding of bacterial secondary metabolites, and promote the identification of ecological and evolutionary factors shaping the biosynthetic potential of microbial communities.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Despite its importance, conducting manual experiments with individual fruit flies can be challenging and time-consuming, especially for studies of individual fly behaviors. Such studies often involve cumbersome preparatory steps, such as manually tethering a fly and then positioning it within an experimental setup1,2. These procedures commonly require the fly to be anesthetized, and, before behavioral assessments begin, the fly must recover from anesthesia. Hence, the introduction of automated phenotyping and behavioral assays would expedite important aspects of fly research, by minimizing manual handling of flies and decreasing the net time needed for experiments. Here, we introduce FlyMAX (Fly Manipulation and Autonomous eXperimentation), an autonomous robotic system for manipulating adult flies without use of anesthesia. FlyMAX collects individual flies from a standard vial, analyzes them with computer vision, and achieves a throughput of >1,000 flies per day for high-throughput inspection and characterization assays. Robotic handling had no detectable adverse effects on fly longevity or our assessments of fly health. Moreover, the behavioral performance of flies, especially of males, was better and less variable than of flies handled manually. Our system employs deep learning-based machine vision for real-time assessments of picking quality and fly phenotypes. This enables fully pipelined, autonomous experimentation for behavioral assays with individual flies in controlled environments, which was previously infeasible. Overall, FlyMAX constitutes a promising technology to enhance the efficiency and reproducibility of research with flies and other insects in fields such as genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Even very young infants engage in active visual selection, looking less and less as stimuli are repeated (habituation) and regaining interest when novel stimuli are subsequently introduced (dishabituation). The mechanisms underlying these looking time changes remain uncertain, however, due to limits on both the scope of existing formal models and the empirical precision of measurements of infant behavior. To address this, we developed the Rational Action, Noisy Choice for Habituation (RANCH) model, which operates over raw images and makes quantitative predictions of participants' looking behaviors. In a series of pre-registered experiments, we exposed infants and adults to stimuli for varying durations and measured looking time to familiar and novel stimuli. We found that these data were well captured by RANCH. Using RANCH's stimulus-computability, we also tested its out-of-sample predictions about the magnitude of dishabituation in a new experiment in which we manipulated the similarity between the familiar and novel stimulus. By framing looking behaviors as rational decision-making, this work identified how the dynamics of learning and exploration guide our visual attention from infancy through adulthood.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Each of the two genomes were broken up into 100-kB segments, each of which was searched for matches to a large set of porcine queries. All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome.

ResultsIn scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds).

Participants received 5 or 10 mg / week of compounded rapamycin, or placebo for 48 weeks. Safety, adverse events (AEs) and blood biomarkers were collected. Efficacy was assessed using DEXA scan-based measures and standardized surveys assessing quality of life (QoL) and frailty. We did not detect significant differences in safety blood biomarkers, or moderate to severe AEs between the rapamycin treatment groups and placebo after 48 weeks. We detected dose-dependent (10 mg group) and sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass, pain, social functioning, overall QoL, and overall osteoarthritis score in females, and in bone mineral content in men. Additionally, some individuals receiving rapamycin experienced significant improvements in body composition metrics that were associated with beneficial changes in gut health and lipid metabolism. We conclude that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin administration over the course of 48 weeks is safe and induces sex-specific improvements in multiple aspects of healthspan, with the most robust improvements in lean tissue mass in women taking 10 mg rapamycin/week.

What factors determine whether a precursor cell differentiates or retains the capacity to divide? Here, we leverage the developmental flexibility of the stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) in Arabidopsis leaves as a model for how flexible decisions are regulated. Using a quantitative approach that combines long-term live imaging and statistical modeling, we discover that cell size is a strong predictor of SLGC behaviour: larger SLGCs divide less often than smaller cells. We propose that cell size is linked to division behaviour at multiple spatial scales. At the neighbourhood scale, cell size correlates with the strength of cell-cell signaling, which affects the rate at which SPEECHLESS (SPCH), a division-promoting transcription factor, is degraded. At the subcellular scale, cell size correlates with nuclear size, which modulates the concentration of SPCH in the nucleus. Our work shows how initial differences in SPCH levels are canalized by nuclear size and cell-cell signaling to inform the behaviour of a flexible cell type.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

To exert these functions, efficient binding of IgG to gut bacterial antigens and engagement of Fc and complement dependent effector functions in offspring was required. These discoveries reveal a novel mechanism wherein maternal IgG engages the offspring immune system to calibrate responses to gut microbes. This mode of maternal immune instruction may provide adaptability to developmental shifts in microbiota necessary for establishing host-microbiota mutualism and limiting susceptibility to inflammatory disease.

Glyoxylate, a key metabolite in (synthetic) CO2 fixation and carbon-conserving pathways, served as the test molecule. Through iterative screening of a compact metabolic model, we identified non-trivial growth-coupled designs that resulted in six metabolic sensors with a wide sensitivity range for glyoxylate, spanning three orders of magnitude in detected concentrations. We further adapted these E. coli strains for sensing glycolate and demonstrated their utility in both pathway engineering (testing a key metabolic module via glyoxylate) and applications in environmental monitoring (quantifying glycolate produced by photosynthetic microalgae). The versatility and ease of implementation of this workflow make it suitable for designing and building multiple metabolic sensors for diverse biotechnological applications.

Our study aims to quantify the impact of vaccination programmes during this initial year of vaccination by estimating the number of case fatalities avoided, having Sweden as a case study.

MethodsUsing Swedish data on age-specific reported incidence, vaccination uptake, and contact structures, along with age-specific estimates on the vaccine efficacies and under-reporting from the literature, we fit a Bayesian SEIR epidemic model with time-varying community contact rate {beta}(t) for COVID-19 incidence. By adding age-specific infection fatality rates, we obtain an estimate of about 5,540 (95% PI: 5,390-5,690) for the number of case fatalities from the fitted model. This estimate aligns closely with the reported 5,430 case fatalities during the same period. We then use the estimated contact rate {beta}(t) in a counterfactual analysis where the population is unvaccinated, leading to more infections and fatalities.

FindingsThe counterfactual analysis result in a severe epidemic outbreak during the early autumn of 2021, resulting in about 52,600 (49,900-55,500) number of case fatalities. Consequently, the number of lives saved by the vaccination program is estimated to be about 47,100 (44,500-49,800), out of which 6,460 are directly saved and 40,600 are indirectly saved, mainly by drastically reducing the severe outbreak in the early autumn of 2021, which would have occurred without vaccination and unchanged community contact rate.

InterpretationOur mathematical model is used to analyze the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on lives saved in Sweden during 2021, but the same methodology can be applied to other countries. The counterfactual analysis offers insights into an alternative trajectory of the pandemic without vaccination. By incorporating estimated vaccination-related parameters, age-specific infection fatality ratio and under-reporting, our model estimates the number of case fatalities avoided. The results not only show the direct impact of vaccination on reducing deaths for infected individuals but also shed light on the indirect effects of reduced transmission dynamics.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSVaccination against COVID-19 has been proven to reduce infection rates, hospitalizations, and mortality. Observational studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy COVID-19 vaccines, and mathematical modeling studies have been conducted to predict the potential outcomes of vaccination programmes under different scenarios. These models have provided insights into the benefits of achieving high vaccination coverage and the consequences of delays or interruptions in vaccine distribution. There remains a gap in analyses that quantify the impact of the vaccination programme in Sweden by comparing actual outcomes with a scenario without vaccination. This study aims to fill this gap by employing a robust counterfactual analysis method to provide a clearer picture of the COVID-19 vaccination impact in Sweden. This approach offers a understanding of the impact of vaccination by isolating the effects of the vaccination from other interventions. For our literature review, we have searched PubMed for ""vaccination counterfactual analysis"", ""SEIR model vaccination impact"", ""quantifying effect of COVID-19 vaccination"" and ""COVID-19 IFR"". The Swedish Public Health Agency has provided country-specific data for Sweden.

Added value of this studyThe Bayesian SEIR model presented in this paper provides a flexible and data-driven framework to assess the effectiveness of vaccination strategies. Using age- and country-specific data and parameters on reported cases, under-reporting and infection fatality rate (IFR), we can quantify the effect of vaccination in Sweden 2021. This study compares the case fatalities in a factual analysis with a counterfactual analysis, which has the same contact rates but with a unvaccinated population. The comparison allows an estimate of the number of lives saved from the vaccination. The methodology can be used to evaluate the effect of vaccination in other countries, but also for other counterfactual scenarios such as different vaccination schemes.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings highlight the critical role of vaccination in mitigating COVID-19-related mortality. Through the counterfactual analysis provided by the SEIR epidemic model, we gain insights into the effects of vaccination programmes. Beyond reducing deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 infection vaccination also exerts a broader societal impact by curbing transmission rates and easing strain on healthcare systems. Moreover, by quantifying the number of lives saved through vaccination efforts, we offer policymakers and public health officials invaluable data for optimizing future vaccination strategies and reinforcing the importance of widespread vaccine uptake. The insights gained from this study not only show the effectiveness of vaccination in saving lives but also provide a robust framework of a data-driven approach to guide evidence-based decision-making and shaping vaccination policies.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601

Although individual neurons and their activity traces can be extracted from these videos with automated algorithms, the results often require human curation to remove false positives, a laborious process called cell sorting. To address this challenge, we introduce ActSort, an active-learning algorithm for sorting large-scale datasets that integrates features engineered by domain experts together with data formats with minimal memory requirements. By strategically bringing outlier cell candidates near the decision boundary up for annotation, ActSort reduces human labor to about 1-3% of cell candidates and improves curation accuracy by mitigating annotator bias. To facilitate the algorithms widespread adoption among experimental neuroscientists, we created a user-friendly software and conducted a first-of-its-kind benchmarking study involving about 160,000 annotations. Our tests validated ActSorts performance across different experimental conditions and datasets from multiple animals. Overall, ActSort addresses a crucial bottleneck in processing large-scale calcium videos of neural activity and thereby facilitates systems neuroscience experiments at previously inaccessible scales.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Our findings reveal that DCs with similar hyperactivated transcriptional phenotypes interact with helper T cells both within tumors and in the tdLN, and that checkpoint blockade drugs enhance these interactions.

To evaluate LRSs additional diagnostic yield, we sequenced a rare disease cohort of 98 samples, including 41 probands and some family members, using nanopore sequencing, achieving per sample [~]36x average coverage and 32 kilobase (kb) read N50 from a single flow cell.

In comparison to SRS, LRS detected additional rare, functionally annotated variants, including SVs and tandem repeats, and completely phased 87% of protein-coding genes. LRS detected additional de novo variants, and could be used to distinguish postzygotic mosaic variants from prezygotic de novos.

The variable loops of the antibody complementarity-determining region (CDR) are particularly crucial for immune responses and therapeutic applications due to their effective target recognition capabilities. Accurate structure prediction of these antibody loops is essential for the efficient in silico design of target-binding antibodies for therapeutic or industrial use. However, predicting antibody loop structures is challenging due to the lack of evolutionary information from related proteins. Thus, a successful ab initio structure prediction method, which operates without structural templates or related sequences, is crucial for the effective design of antibody loopmediated interactions. This study demonstrates that highly accurate antibody loop structure prediction enables the effective zero-shot design of target-binding antibody loops. The performance of loop design has been shown to depend on the accuracy of ab initio loop structure prediction, as tested with two versions of our design model. The high affinity, diversity, novelty, and specificity of the antibody loops designed with these new methods were validated experimentally on four target proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Dysregulation of insulin signaling in neurons and astrocytes has been implicated in altered mood, cognition, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). To define the role of insulin signaling in microglia, the primary phagocytes in brain critical for maintenance and damage repair, we created mice with an inducible microglia-specific insulin receptor knockout (MG-IRKO). RiboTag profiling of microglial mRNAs revealed that loss of insulin signaling results in alterations of gene expression in pathways related to innate immunity and cellular metabolism. In vitro, loss of insulin signaling in microglia results in metabolic reprograming with an increase in glycolysis and impaired uptake of A{beta}. In vivo, MG-IRKO mice exhibit alterations in mood and social behavior, and when crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, the resultant mice exhibit increased levels of A{beta} plaque and elevated neuroinflammation. Thus, insulin signaling in microglia plays a key role in microglial cellular metabolism, neuroinflammation and the ability of the cells to take up A{beta}, such that reduced insulin signaling in microglia alters mood and social behavior and accelerates AD pathogenesis. Together these data indicate key roles of insulin action in microglia and the potential of targeting insulin signaling in microglia in treatment of AD.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

However, HMGB1 is less abundant than H1 and binds nucleosomes more weakly raising the question of how HMGB1 effectively competes with H1. Here, we show that HMGB1 rescues H1's inhibition of nucleosomal DNA accessibility without displacing H1. HMGB1 also increases the dynamics of condensed, H1-bound chromatin. Cryo-EM shows that HMGB1 binds at internal locations on a nucleosome and locally distorts the DNA. These sites, which are away from the binding site of H1, explain how HMGB1 and H1 co-occupy a nucleosome. Our findings lead to a model where HMGB1 counteracts the activity of H1 by distorting nucleosomal DNA and by contacting the H1 C-terminal tail. Compared to direct competition, nucleosome co-occupancy by HMGB1 and H1 allows a greater diversity of dynamic chromatin states and may be generalizable to other chromatin regulators.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3.

Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Thus far, only a limited number of Clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized, and they are not representative across different regions and time periods.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17/26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 423/603 (70.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to Clade I, among which 17 were Clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (95%) of the new strains fall within previously described Clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among Clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows multiple virus lineages being present within a large urban center.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic in DRC is predominated by zoonotic spillover events involving Clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the Clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601

This technology allows researchers to sequence longer DNA fragments in a single read, providing more comprehensive genomic information compared to previous methods. Nanopore sequencing operates on electrical signals generated by a nanopore embedded in a membrane separating two electrolyte-filled chambers. When single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) passes through the nanopore, it creates variations in the current that correspond to different DNA bases. By analyzing these current fluctuations with machine learning algorithms, the DNA sequence can be determined. In this study, we introduced several improvements to nanopore sequencing, including nanopore local chemistry sequencing, novel motor and pore proteins, chip design, and basecalling algorithms. Our new nanopore sequencing platform, CycloneSEQ, demonstrated long-duration sequencing (107 hours) on a single chip with high yield (>50 Gb). In human genomic DNA sequencing, CycloneSEQ was able to produce long reads with N50 33.6 kb and modal identity 97.0%. Preliminary findings on human whole-genome de novo assembly, variant calling, metagenomics sequencing, and single-cell RNA sequencing have further highlighted CycloneSEQs potential across different areas of genomics.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha).

Key to this are activation domains, which often fall within disordered regions of transcription factors3,4 and recruit co-activators to initiate transcription5. These interactions are difficult to characterize via most experimental techniques because they are typically weak and transient6,7. Consequently, we know very little about whether these interactions are promiscuous or specific, the mechanisms of binding, and how these interactions tune the strength of gene activation. To address these questions, we developed a microfluidic platform for expression and purification of hundreds of activation domains in parallel followed by direct measurement of co-activator binding affinities (STAMMPPING, for Simultaneous Trapping of Affinity Measurements via a Microfluidic Protein-Protein INteraction Generator). By applying STAMMPPING to quantify direct interactions between eight co-activators and 204 human activation domains (>1,500 Kds), we provide the first quantitative map of these interactions and reveal 334 novel binding pairs. We find that the metazoan-specific co-activator P300 directly binds >100 activation domains, potentially explaining its widespread recruitment across the genome to influence transcriptional activation. Despite sharing similar molecular properties (e.g. enrichment of negative and hydrophobic residues), activation domains utilize distinct biophysical properties to recruit certain co-activator domains. Co-activator domain affinity and occupancy are well-predicted by analytical models that account for multivalency, and in vitro affinities quantitatively predict activation in cells with an ultrasensitive response. Not only do our results demonstrate the ability to measure affinities between even weak protein-protein interactions in high throughput, but they also provide a necessary resource of over 1,500 activation domain/co-activator affinities which lays the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of transcriptional activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601

Here, we show that stabilizing selection on quantitative traits--even around the same optimal trait values in the two populations and when the populations are demographically identical--generates selection against the minor-parent ancestry in a population formed via unequal admixture of the two populations. We calculate the rate at which minor-parent ancestry is purged under this mechanism, both in the early generations after admixture and in the long term, and we verify these calculations with whole-genome simulations. Because of its ubiquity, stabilizing selection offers a general mechanism for the deleterious effect of introgressed ancestry.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Such studies face the central difficulty of distinguishing possible causal influences, in particular genetic and non-genetic ones. When confounding between possible influences is not rigorously addressed, it invites over- and misinterpretation of data. We illustrate the breadth of this problem through a discussion of the literature and a reanalysis of two examples. Clark (2023) suggested that patterns of similarity in social status between relatives indicate that social status is largely determined by ones DNA. We show that the papers conclusions are based on the conflation of genetic and non-genetic transmission, such as wealth, within families. Song & Zhang (2024) posited that genetic variants underlying bisexual behavior are maintained in the population because they also affect risk-taking behavior, thereby conferring an evolutionary fitness advantage through increased sexual promiscuity. In this case, too, we show that possible explanations cannot be distinguished, but only one is chosen and presented as a conclusion. We discuss how issues of confounding apply more broadly to studies that claim to establish genetic underpinnings to human behavior and societal outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Here, we use the UK Biobank to measure the change in PGS prediction accuracy as a continuous function of individuals genome-wide genetic dissimilarity to the GWAS sample (""genetic distance""). Our results highlight three gaps in our understanding of PGS portability. First, prediction accuracy is extremely noisy at the individual level and not well predicted by genetic distance. In fact, variance in prediction accuracy is explained comparably well by socioeconomic measures. Second, trends of portability vary across traits. For several immunity-related traits, prediction accuracy drops near zero quickly even at intermediate levels of genetic distance. This quick drop may reflect GWAS associations being more ancestry-specific in immunity-related traits than in other traits. Third, we show that even qualitative trends of portability can depend on the measure of prediction accuracy used. For instance, for white blood cell count, a measure of prediction accuracy at the individual level (reduction in mean squared error) increases with genetic distance. Together, our results show that portability cannot be understood through global ancestry groupings alone. There are other, understudied factors influencing portability, such as the specifics of the evolution of the trait and its genetic architecture, social context, and the construction of the polygenic score. Addressing these gaps can aid in the development and application of PGS and inform more equitable genomic research.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

High-accuracy, long-read sequencing can substantially improve SV characterization when coupled with effective calling methods. While state-of the-art long-read SV callers are highly accurate, further improvements are achievable by systematically modeling local haplotypes during SV discovery and genotyping.

ResultsWe describe sawfish, an SV caller for mapped high-quality long reads incorporating systematic SV haplotype modeling to improve accuracy and resolution. Assessment against the draft Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) SV benchmark from the T2T-HG002-Q100 diploid assembly shows that sawfish has the highest accuracy among state-of-the-art long-read SV callers across every tested SV size group. Additionally, sawfish maintains the highest accuracy at every tested depth level from 10 to 32-fold coverage, such that other callers required at least 30-fold coverage to match sawfish accuracy at 15-fold coverage. Sawfish also shows the highest accuracy in the GIAB challenging medically relevant genes benchmark, demonstrating improvements in both comprehensive and medically relevant contexts.

When joint-genotyping 10 samples from CEPH-1463, sawfish has over 9000 more pedigree-concordant calls than other state-of-the-art SV callers, with the highest proportion of concordant SVs (78%) as well. Sawfishs quality model can be used to select for an even higher proportion of concordant SVs (86%), while still calling over 5000 more pedigree-concordant SVs than other callers. These results demonstrate that sawfish improves on the state-of-the-art for long-read SV calling accuracy across both individual and joint-sample analyses.

We found that some genes co-localize in ""anti-defense islands"", including E. coli T4 and Lambda phages, although many are standalone. Out of the 112 systems detected in bacteria, 100 systems localize only or preferentially in prophages, plasmids, phage satellites, integrons, and integrative and conjugative elements. However, over 80% of anti-Pycsar protein 1 (Apyc1) resides in non-mobile regions of bacteria. Evolutionary and functional analyses revealed that Apyc1 likely originated in bacteria to regulate cNMP signaling, but was co-opted multiple times by phages to overcome cNMP-utilizing defenses. With the AntiDefenseFinder tool, we hope to facilitate the identification of the full repertoire of anti-defense systems in MGEs, the discovery of new protein functions, and a deeper understanding of host-pathogen arms race.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

We here investigated the effects of age, mutations, and homo-/heterologous vaccination regimens on the dominant pan-coronavirus-specific cellular and humoral epitope iCope after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in detail. In the older, quantitatively, and qualitatively reduced iCope-reactive CD4+ T cell responses with narrow TCR repertoires could not be enhanced by vaccination and were further compromised by emerging spike mutations. In contrast pan-coronavirus-reactive humoral immunity was affected only by mutations and not by age. Our results reveal a distinct deficiency of the dichotomous layer of pan-coronavirus immunity in the older, critical for long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

This slicing drives post-transcriptional gene-silencing pathways that are essential for many eukaryotes and the basis for new clinical therapies.

Here we present the cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of a human AGO-guide complex bound to a fully paired target, revealing structural rearrangements that enable this conformation. Critically, the N domain of AGO rotates to allow the RNA full access to the central channel and forms contacts that license rapid slicing. Moreover, a conserved loop in the PIWI domain secures the RNA near the active site to enhance slicing rate and specificity. These results explain how AGO accommodates targets possessing the pairing specificity typically observed in biological and clinical slicing substrates.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

In particular, red-shifted opsins offer access deeper within the brain tissue. It is however crucial to consider the potential unintended back-activation of endogenous opsins due to laser light striking the back of the retina. Here, we found that in complete darkness and with no expression of exogenous opsins, optical fiber laser stimulation at wavelengths of 637 nm (red), 594 nm (orange), or 473 nm (blue) from within the ipsilateral mouse visual cortex resulted in a strong neuronal response in its contralateral counterpart. This neuronal activation occurred even at low laser intensities (1mW at the fiber tip, 31.8mW/mm2) and was most pronounced using red wavelengths. We therefore took advantage of retinal light adaptation using external illumination with a relatively dim ambient light source (20 lux) which was found to completely abolish orange and blue laser-evoked neuronal activation from within the brain, even at high laser intensities (15mW, 477.3mW/mm2). To prevent red laser-evoked retinal activation, however, only much lower intensities (2.5mW, 79.6mW/mm2) combined with external illumination (20 lux) could be used. These findings demonstrate the critical need for careful selection of light wavelengths and intensities for laser stimulation during optogenetic experiments in the mouse brain in vivo. Additionally, light adaptation of the retina through ambient light exposure offers an effective solution to minimize unintended retinal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Despite advances in single-cell technologies, the molecular and cellular responses that contribute to long-term post-stroke impairment remain poorly understood. To gain better insight into the underlying mechanisms, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from distinct brain regions using a mouse model of permanent focal ischemia at one month post-injury. Our findings reveal cell- and region-specific changes within the stroke-injured and peri-infarct brain tissue. For instance, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exhibited upregulated genes in signaling pathways involved in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, and downregulated pathways associated with aerobic metabolism. Using cell-cell communication analysis, we identified increased strength in predicted interactions within stroke tissue among both neural and non-neural cells via signaling pathways such as those involving collagen, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, neuronal growth regulator, laminin, and several cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between mouse transcriptome responses after stroke and those observed in human nonfatal brain stroke lesions. Common molecular features were linked to inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix organization, and angiogenesis. Our findings provide a detailed resource for advancing our molecular understanding of stroke pathology and for discovering therapeutic targets in the repair phase of stroke recovery.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a spatial-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Here we engineered, characterized, and validated the first genetically encoded biosensors for polyamines, named iPASnFRs. We demonstrate the utility of iPASnFR for detecting polyamine import into mammalian cells, to the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and the nucleus. We demonstrate that these sensors are useful to probe the activity of polyamine transporters and to uncover biochemical pathways underlying the distribution of polyamines amongst organelles. The sensors powered a high-throughput small molecule compound library screen, revealing multiple compounds in different chemical classes that strongly modulate cellular polyamine levels.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724796474601

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1724796474601
