Methods: We employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird). Results: We detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain. Conclusions: While our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

There is limited understanding of factors that influence their biodistribution and immunogenicity. Antibodies to polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, are detectable in humans and boosted by human mRNA vaccination. We hypothesized that PEG-specific antibodies could increase the clearance of mRNA vaccines. We developed methods to quantify both the mRNA and ionizable lipid in frequent serial blood samples from 19 subjects receiving Moderna SPIKEVAX mRNA booster immunization. Both the mRNA and ionizable lipid peaked in blood 1-2 days post vaccination (median peak level 0.19 and 3.22 ng mL-1, respectively). The mRNA was detectable out to 14-28 days post-vaccination in most subjects. We measured the proportion of mRNA that was relatively intact in blood over time and found the decay kinetics of the intact mRNA and ionizable lipid were identical, suggesting the intact lipid nanoparticle recirculates in blood. However, mRNA and ionizable lipid decay rates did not correlate with baseline levels of PEG-specific nor spike-specific antibodies. The magnitude of mRNA and ionizable lipid detected in blood did correlate with the boost in PEG antibodies. Further, the ability of subjects monocytes to phagocytose lipid nanoparticles had an inverse relationship with the rise in PEG antibodies. This suggests circulation of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines into the blood and their ability to be cleared by phagocytes influence PEG immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines. Overall, this work defines the pharmacokinetics of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccine components in human blood after intramuscular injection and the factors that influence this. These insights should prove useful in improving the future safety and efficacy of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

However, other brain regions like the cerebellum and brain stem remain largely intact despite the universal expression of tau throughout the brain. Here, we found that an understudied splice isoform of tau termed ""big tau"" is significantly more abundant in the brain regions less vulnerable to tau pathology compared to tau pathology-vulnerable regions. We used various cellular and animal models to demonstrate that big tau possesses multiple properties that can resist AD-related pathological changes. Importantly, human AD patients show a higher expression level of pathology-resisting big tau in the cerebellum, the brain region spared from tau pathology. Our study examines the unique properties of big tau, expanding our current understanding of tau pathophysiology. Altogether, our data suggest that alternative splicing to favor big tau is a viable strategy to modulate tau pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

We examined the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across various bacterial pathogens and antibiotics.

We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24th, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium (as defined by the study authors) was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool.

42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 =77%). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions.

The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm. Trials powered to detect differences in resistance development or well-designed observational studies are required to clarify the impact of combination therapy on resistance.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterisation of genes that act at the phage-host interface. To date, this is restricted to few model phage-host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers (ASOs) to silence genes of both DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage {Phi}KZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognised proteins that are essential for phage replication and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is a {Phi}KZ-encoded nuclease that acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. The non-genetic ASO-based gene silencing used here promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage-host pairs, and offers potential for optimising phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study examined the relationships between macronutrients, dietary components, and sleep parameters, considering their interdependencies.

MethodsData from 4,825 users of sleep and nutrition apps for at least 7 days were analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis investigated associations between quartiles of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats), dietary components (sodium, potassium, dietary fiber, and sodium-to-potassium ratio), and sleep variables (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], and % wakefulness after sleep onset [%WASO]). Nutrients were divided into quartiles, with the lowest intake group as the reference. Compositional data analysis accounted for interdependencies among macronutrients. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

ResultsHigher protein intake was associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.27). Higher total fat intake was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.27) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.25, -0.07). Higher carbohydrate intake was associated with shorter %WASO in the 3rd (B = -0.82, 95% CI = -1.37, -0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.57, 95% CI = -1.13, -0.01), while higher total fat intake was linked to longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.06, 1.18). Higher dietary fiber intake was consistently associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.19) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26), shorter SL in the 2nd (B = -1.71, 95% CI = -2.66, -0.76), 3rd (B = -2.23, 95% CI = -3.19, -1.27), and 4th quartiles (B = -2.30, 95% CI = -3.27, -1.33), and shorter %WASO in the 2nd (B = -1.06, 95% CI = -1.61, -0.51), 3rd (B = -1.04, 95% CI = -1.59, -0.48), and 4th quartiles (B = -1.05, 95% CI = -1.61, -0.48). A higher sodium-to-potassium ratio was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.02) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.28, -0.10), longer SL in the 2nd (B = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.08, 1.98) and 4th quartiles (B = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.53, 2.47), and longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.15, 1.28). Compositional data analysis, involving 6% changes in macronutrient proportions, showed higher protein intake correlated with longer TST (B = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.35), while more monounsaturated fats were linked to longer SL (B = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.93, 7.34) and %WASO (B = 2.21, 95% CI = 0.63, 3.78). Higher polyunsaturated fat intake correlated with shorter TST (B = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.39, -0.05), shorter SL (B = -4.72, 95% CI = -6.58, -2.86), and shorter %WASO (B = -2.00, 95% CI = -3.08, -0.92).

Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon via admixture, while the others established early in the deep benthics. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage and a striking excess of protein changing substitutions pointing towards selection on sensory, behavioural and reproductive genes.

We now report high-resolution structures showing new transitions in the kinesin mechanochemical cycle, including power stroke fluctuations upon ATP binding and a post-hydrolysis state with bound ADP + free phosphate. We find that rate-limiting ADP release occurs upon microtubule binding, accompanied by central {beta}-sheet twisting, which triggers the power stroke - stalk rotation and neck mimic docking - upon ATP binding. Microtubule release occurs with {beta}-strand-to-loop transitions, implying that {beta}-strand refolding induces Pi release and the recovery stroke. The strained {beta}-sheet during the power stroke and strand-to-loop transitions identify the {beta}-sheet as the long-sought motor spring.

TeaserStalk rotation, {beta}-sheet twisting and refolding, and neck mimic docking drive the reversed working stroke of kinesin-14

INTRODUCTIONKinesin family proteins couple ATP hydrolysis to microtubule binding, generating force to produce steps or displacements along microtubules. The mechanism by which kinesins and other cytoskeletal motor proteins produce force is not fully understood. A current hypothesis is that the motors contain a spring-like or elastic element that creates strain under load during nucleotide binding or release, followed by a strain-relieving conformational change that produces force and a working stroke of the motor. The spring has not yet been identified for any motor. The power stroke differs for different motors - it consists of neck linker docking for plus-end directed kinesin-1 or a swing of the helical stalk for minus-end directed kinesin-14.

RATIONALEDespite considerable research, the molecular dynamics of the kinesin-14 power stroke are still obscure, impeded by the weak microtubule binding of the motor. We overcame the weak binding by introducing a point mutation into the motor that results in faster ATP hydrolysis than wild type and tighter microtubule binding, which enabled us to resolve the motor mode of action. We now present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and x-ray structures of key mechanochemical states across the full force-producing cycle of a kinesin dimeric motor.

RESULTSThe new structures represent five different nucleotide states - two pre-power stroke states, a fluctuating power stroke, and two post-power stroke states. The structures are both microtubule-attached and unattached. They show the motor trapped in previously unreported transition states and reveal new conformational changes involved in energy transduction. The new transition states include a transient state in which the power stroke fluctuates during ATP binding and a new state of a kinesin motor bound to ADP and free Pi prior to phosphate release. The conformational changes include the folding of the kinesin-14 neck mimic into a structure resembling the docked kinesin-1 neck linker, accompanying the power stroke, and previously unreported {beta}-strand-to-loop transitions with stored free energy that potentially induce Pi release and drive the recovery stroke. We interpret the new structures in the context of the hypothesis that the central {beta}-sheet undergoes distortional changes during the mechanochemical cycle that store and release free energy, functioning as the elusive spring of the motors.

CONCLUSIONThe new structures show that force is produced by coupled movements of the helical stalk, central {beta}-sheet, and neck mimic, and uncover structural changes during the power stroke that are conserved among kinesins and myosin. We find that kinesin-14 binds to a microtubule by one head during the mechanical cycle, undergoes rate-limiting ADP release, and changes in conformation during ATP binding and hydrolysis to produce force. Notably, kinesin-14 utilizes the same mechanical strategy for force production as other kinesins but couples the changes to a large swing of the stalk, an innovation derived from myosin that is not observed for kinesin-1 or other kinesin motors. Force is produced by rearranging the binding surfaces of the stalk, strand {beta}1, helices [a]4 and [a]6, and the neck mimic, and by twisting and shortening strands of the central {beta}-sheet. These structural changes produce a power stroke - rotation of the helical stalk accompanied by neck mimic docking - during the transition from the nucleotide-free to ATP-bound state, and a reverse stroke after phosphate release that reprimes the motor for the next microtubule binding interaction.

However, it remains challenging to quantify condensate material properties in living systems. Here, we first identified distinct regulators on the viscosity and interfacial tension of reconstituted synapsin condensates: crowding agent, synaptic vesicles, and the synucleinopathy marker alpha-synuclein. Furthermore, we developed a new approach based on micropipette aspiration and whole-cell patch clamp (MAPAC) that allows material quantifications of synapsin condensates in living cells. Guided by in vitro results, we found the partitioning of alpha-synuclein critically regulates the viscoelasticity of cellular synapsin condensates, a property that varies over 10,000-fold between cells. Overall, our study provides direct quantitative insights into the regulation of synapsin condensates. Importantly, the platform developed in this study can be broadly applied to study the material properties of condensates in living systems.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the reemergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024. Methods: In this study, we combined OROV genomic, molecular, and serological data from Brazil from 1 January 2015 to 29 June 2024, along with in vitro and in vivo characterization. Molecular screening data included 234 patients with febrile illness or central nervous system (CNS) manifestations between December 2023 and May 2024 from the Amazonas State. Genomic data comprised two genomic OROV sequences from patients. Serological data were obtained from neutralizing antibody tests comparing the prototype OROV strain BeAn 19991 and the 2024 epidemic strain. Epidemiological data included aggregated cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 1 January 2014 to 29 June 2024. Findings: In 2024, autochthonous OROV infections were detected in previously non-endemic areas across all five Brazilian regions. Cases were reported in 19 of 27 federal units, with 83.2% (6,895 of 8,284) of infections in Northern Brazil and a nearly 200-fold increase in incidence compared to reported cases over the last decade. We detected OROV RNA in 10.8% (10 of 93) of patients with febrile illness and 2.1% (3 of 141) of patients with CNS manifestations between December 2023 and May 2024 in Amazonas. We demonstrate that the 2023-2024 epidemic was caused by a novel OROV reassortant that replicated approximately 100-fold higher titers in mammalian cells compared to the prototype strain. The 2023-2024 OROV reassortant displayed plaques earlier than the prototype, produced 1.7 times more plaques, and plaque sizes were 2.5 larger compared to the prototype. Furthermore, serum collected in 2016 from previously OROV-infected individuals showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralizing capacity against the reassortment strain compared to the prototype. Interpretation: These findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to a better understanding of the 2023-2024 OROV reemergence. The recent increased incidence may be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new reassortant virus that also evades previous immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

We identified risk genes expressed in brain organizers and sequential gene regulatory networks across corticogenesis revealing disease-specific critical phases, when NSCs are more vulnerable to gene dysfunctions, and converging signaling across multiple diseases. Moreover, we simulated the impact of risk transcription factor (TF) depletions on different neural cell types spanning the developing human neocortex and observed a spatiotemporal-dependent effect for each perturbation. Finally, single-cell transcriptomics of newly generated autism-affected patient-derived NSCs in vitro revealed recurrent alterations of TFs orchestrating brain patterning and NSC lineage commitment.

Methods: PTSD/MDD patients were randomized (N=51) to a two-condition sequence in a two period cross-over design. For the first condition, patients were randomized to 10-session rTMS treatment to either a subgenual cingulate (sgACC) functional connectivity cortical target (fMRI-guided) or standard scalp-based target. Additionally, patients were randomized to either watch a nature video or perform a demanding cognitive task with rTMS administration. Patients crossed over to the two conditions not received in period one. rTMS was delivered in an intermittent theta burst (iTBS) pattern with 2400 pulses per session. Among N=49 patients analyzed, 60% identified as female and average age was 34. Results: Compared with the scalp-based target, fMRI-guided rTMS was superior in improving depression symptoms (F(1,43.92)=5.933, p=0.019) as well as PTSD hyperarousal (F(1,40.78)=5.076, p=0.030). The median level of symptom change for fMRI-guided targets exceeded 60% improvement across both scales. Symptom improvements at 6-mo follow-up were durable and both favored fMRI-guidance. For patients reporting symptoms at this timepoint, depression improved by 70% (N13); the PCL improved by 69% with Hyperarousal (N14) and Avoidance (N12) subscales improving by 78% and 79%, respectively, for the fMRI-guided target. Conclusions: We demonstrated preliminary evidence for the clinical superiority of a new fMRI-guided target which should be followed up with larger comparative effectiveness studies that include imaging and clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

As the virus has now been circulating entirely among dogs for 20 years, we here update our understanding of the evolution of virus in its new host. As a host-switched virus, H3N2 CIV will also reveal any host-adaptive changes arising during thousands of infections within its new host, and our analysis showed that the virus has evolved at a constant rate. CIV was first introduced into North America in 2015 from Korea, and we specifically examined the epidemiology of the virus among dogs in North America since then, including local outbreaks, regional die-outs, and repeated reintroduction from Asia. The H3N2 CIV now appears endemic only in China after dying out in South Korea around 2017. Virus lineages circulating in China appear to have seeded the most recent US outbreaks - with 2 or 3 introductions into North America during the past 3 years. Combining clinical reports, diagnostic testing data, and analysis of viral genomes we show that the virus spreads rapidly among dogs in kennels and shelters in different regions - likely dying out locally after all those animals become infected and immune. The overall epidemic therefore requires longer-distance dispersal of virus to initiate outbreaks in new locations. Patterns of spread in the USA may select viruses most adapted to those dense populations, which may lack the properties required for efficient long-distance transfers to other dog populations that would keep the virus in prolonged circulation.

IMPORTANCEViruses occasionally jump into new hosts to cause epidemics and may spread widely due to movement of humans or animals, or their viruses, with profound consequences for global health. The emergence and epidemiology of new epidemic viruses in companion animals provides a model for understanding disease dynamics and evolution. The H3N2 canine influenza virus arose from an avian virus, and infected dogs provide many opportunities for human exposure. H3N2 CIV transmission is dominated by fast-moving outbreaks within dense populations in animal shelters or kennels, while sustaining the epidemic likely requires movement of virus to more distant dog populations. Viral spread within North Americahas only been sustained for a few years at a time after which the virus dies out. The epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of this virus in this structured host population shows how an acute respiratory pathogen can emerge and spread in a new host and population.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

Recent studies suggest there is a primate-specific population of striatal inhibitory interneurons, the TAC3 interneurons5. However, there has not yet been a detailed analysis of the spatial and phylogenetic distribution of this population. Here, we profile single cell gene expression in the developing pig (an ungulate) and ferret (a carnivore), representing 94 million years divergence from primates, and assign newborn inhibitory neurons to initial classes first specified during development6. We find that the initial class of TAC3 interneurons represents an ancestral striatal population that is also deployed towards the cortex in pig and ferret. In adult mouse, we uncover a rare population expressing Tac2, the ortholog of TAC3, in ventromedial striatum, prompting a reexamination of developing mouse striatal interneuron initial classes by targeted enrichment of their precursors. We conclude that the TAC3 interneuron initial class is conserved across Boreoeutherian mammals, with the mouse population representing Th striatal interneurons, a subset of which expresses Tac2. This study suggests that initial classes of telencephalic inhibitory neurons are largely conserved and that during evolution, neuronal types in the mammalian brain change through redistribution and fate refinement, rather than by derivation of novel precursors early in development.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

Recent advances in MRI hardware and new biophysical models of tissue informed by diffusion MRI data hold promise for identifying the cellular changes driving these morphological observations. This study used ultra-strong gradient MRI to obtain high-resolution, in vivo estimates of cortical neurite and soma microstructure in sample of typically developing children and adolescents. Cortical neurite signal fraction, attributed to neuronal and glial processes, increased with age (mean R2fneurite=.53, p<3.3e-11, 11.91% increase over age), while apparent soma radius decreased (mean R2Rsoma=.48, p<4.4e-10, 1% decrease over age) across domain-specific networks. To complement these findings, developmental patterns of cortical gene expression in two independent post-mortem databases were analysed. This revealed increased expression of genes expressed in oligodendrocytes, and excitatory neurons, alongside a relative decrease in expression of genes expressed in astrocyte, microglia and endothelial cell-types. Age-related genes were significantly enriched in cortical oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitors and Layer 5-6 neurons (pFDR<.001) and prominently expressed in adolescence and young adulthood. The spatial and temporal alignment of oligodendrocyte cell-type gene expression with neurite and soma microstructural changes suggest that ongoing cortical myelination processes contribute to adolescent cortical development.

We re-examined the claims of Weng et al., and identified two major points of concern regarding this unprecedented connectedness. First, shared variants between cells are disproportionately detected in a single molecule per cell, and second, these variants are enriched 10-20-fold at the edges of mtDNA molecules, reminiscent of artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. Further, our analyses show that pruning low support and likely artificial mtDNA variants removes nearly all of the reported phylogenetic structure. Thus, we strongly caution against using mtDNA variant calling workflows that rely on minimal evidence, including the computational pipeline introduced in Weng et al., as variants with high connectedness and low evidence are likely artifacts that lead to the construction of false phylogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

Emerging evidence suggests that ether lipids play a significant role in physiology and human health. However, their cellular functions remain largely unknown due to a lack of tools for identifying their subcellular localization and interacting proteins. Here, we address this methodological gap by synthesizing minimally modified bifunctional ether lipid probes by introducing diazirine and alkyne groups. To interrogate the subcellular kinetics of intracellular ether lipid transport in mammalian cells we used a combination of fluorescence imaging, machine learning-assisted image analysis and mathematical modelling. We find that alkyl-linked ether lipids are transported up to twofold faster than vinyl-linked species (plasmalogens), pointing to yet undiscovered cellular lipid transport machinery able to distinguish between linkage types differing by as little as two hydrogen atoms. We find that ether lipid transport predominantly occurs via non-vesicular pathways, with varying contributions from vesicular mechanisms between cell types, hinting at cell type-specific adaptations of the relatively conserved major transport mechanism. Altogether, our results suggest that differential recognition of alkyl- and vinyl ether lipids by lipid transfer proteins contributes to their distinct biological functions. In the future, the probes reported here will enable studying ether lipid biology in much greater detail through identification of interacting proteins and in-depth characterization of intracellular ether lipid dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

By comparing sepal and leaf epidermises with computationally generated randomized tissues we show that giant cells are clustered more than is expected by chance. Our cell-autonomous and stochastic computational model recapitulates the observed giant cell clustering, indicating that clustering emerges as a result of the cell division pattern.

Advances in population-scale sequencing now provide an unprecedented opportunity to uncover additional large-effect rare genetic risk factors and expand our understanding of disease mechanisms.

MethodsWe leveraged whole-genome sequence data with linked electronic health records from 490,560 UK Biobank participants, identifying 3,809 PD cases and 247,101 controls without a neurological disorder. We performed both variant- and gene-level association analyses to identify novel genetic associations with PD. We analyzed two additional independent case-control cohorts for replication (totaling 3,739 cases and 58,156 controls). Additionally, we performed functional validation of a novel PD association in a human synuclein-expressing Drosophila model.

FindingsIn the UK Biobank, we replicated associations in well-established loci including GBA1 and LRRK2. We also identified a novel association between protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in ITSN1 and an increased risk of PD, with an effect size exceeding those of established loci (Fishers Exact Test: p=6.1x10-7; Odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 10.53 [5.20, 21.34]). We replicated the ITSN1 risk signal in a meta-analysis across all cohorts (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test p=5.7x10-9; Odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 9.20 [4.66, 16.70]). In Drosophila, haploinsufficiency of the ITSN1 ortholog (Dap160) exacerbated -synuclein- induced compound eye degeneration and motor deficits.

InterpretationWe establish ITSN1 as a novel risk gene for PD, with PTVs substantially increasing disease risk. ITSN1 encodes a scaffold protein involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, a critical pathway increasingly recognized in PD pathogenesis. Our findings highlight the power of large-scale sequencing coupled with preclinical functional modeling to identify rare variant associations and elucidate disease mechanisms.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

Despite their significance in understanding the history of life on Earth, any interpretation of the nature of these microfossils has been a point of contention among researchers. Decades of back-and-forth arguments led to the consensus that reconstructing the lifecycles of Archaean Eon organisms is the only way of understanding the nature of these microfossils. Here, we transformed a Gram-positive bacterium into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state and studied it under environmental conditions prevalent on early Earth. Using this approach, we successfully reconstructed morphologies and life cycles of Archaean microfossils. In addition to reproducing microfossil morphologies, we conducted experiments that spanned years to understand the process of cell degradation and how Archaean cells could have undergone encrustation minerals (in this case, salt), leading to their preservation as fossilized organic carbon in the rock record. These degradation products strongly resemble fossiliferous features from Archaean rock formations. Our observations suggest that microfossils aged between 3.8 to 2.5Ga most likely were liposome-like protocells that have evolved physiological pathways of energy conservation but not the mechanisms to regulate their morphology. Based on these observations, we propose that morphology is not a reliable indicator of taxonomy in these microfossils.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

Determining the three-dimensional structures of protein-protein-glycan complexes is essential both for the understanding of the mechanisms glycans are involved in, and for applications such as drug design. In this context, molecular docking approaches are of undoubted importance as complementary approaches to experiments. In this study, we show how HADDOCK can be efficiently used for the prediction of protein-glycan complexes. Using a benchmark of 89 complexes, starting from their bound or unbound forms, and assuming some knowledge of the binding site on the protein, our protocol reaches a 70% and 40% top 5 success rate on bound and unbound datasets, respectively.

We demonstrated different coverage landscapes of k-mers enriched in deer and bats and unraveled 148 mutations in enriched k-mers yielded from the comparison of viral metagenomes between bat and human isolates. We observed that the third position within a genetic codon is prone to mutations, resulting in a high frequency of synonymous mutations of amino acids harboring the same physicochemical properties as unaltered amino acids. Finally, we classified and predicted the likelihood of host species based on the enriched k-mer counts.

At templated AP-sites, HMCES DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) regulate replication fork speed while avoiding APE1-mediated cytotoxic double-strand breaks (DSB). Whereas the role of HMCES at template DNA strand is well studied, its consequences on nascent DNA are less understood. Here, we provide evidence that HMCES play detrimental roles during removal of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-deoxycytidine (5hmdC)-derived 5-hydroxymethyl-2-deoxyuridine (5hmdU) by BER at replication forks. HRD cells display heightened HMCES chromatin levels, which increase upon 5hmdC exposure, suggesting that HMCES binds both spontaneous and 5hmdC-induced AP-sites. HMCES depletion largely suppresses 5hmdC-mediated Fancd2-/- replication fork defects, chromosomal aberrations and cell lethality, suggesting that HMCES is responsible for the replication fork impairment and lethality observed in HRD cells.

However, where, when and how recurrent processing contributes to visual processing is incompletely understood due to the difficulties in teasing apart feedforward and recurrent processing. We combined a backward masking paradigm with multivariate analysis on EEG and fMRI data to isolate and characterize the nature of recurrent processing. We find that recurrent processing substantially shapes visual representations across the ventral visual stream, starting early on at around 100ms in early visual cortex (EVC) and in two later phases of around 175 and 300ms in lateral occipital cortex (LOC), adding persistent rather than transient neural dynamics to visual processing. Using deep neural network models for comparison with the brain, we show that recurrence changes the feature format in LOC from predominantly mid-level to more high-level features. Finally, we show that recurrence is mediated by four distinct spectro-temporal neural components in EVC and LOC, which span the theta to beta frequency range. Together, our results reveal the nature and mechanisms of the effects of recurrent processing on the visual representations in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

Here, we used genome-level data to assemble 1164 nuclear single-copy genes and 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes for 149 planthopper species representing 19 out of 21 extant families. Additional markers were added from published mitogenomes, expanding our sampling to 285 species. These markers were used for Maximum Likelihood-based tree inference and dating analyses. The newly inferred phylogenies validated well-accepted relationships and recovered novel placements. Taxonomic conclusions include the establishment of a new family Borysthenidae stat. rev. within Delphacoidea and a new superfamily Meenoploidea superfam. nov. including redefined Kinnaridae stat. rev. and Meenoplidae stat. rev., the confirmation of the monophyletic family Achilixiidae outside the Achilidae-Derbidae clade, and the transfer of tribes Lyncidini and Amyclini to Dictyopharidae and the genus Madagascaritia to Fulgoridae. The time analyses based on 57 nuclear markers and 30 fossils dated the origin of crown Fulgoromorpha back to Guadalupian, Permian ([~]263 Ma), close to the maximum constraint at 267.3 Ma, while applying an older root constraint resulted in an origin in Mississippian, Carboniferous ([~]332 Ma).

During these times, the state of the brain should change rapidly, or reset, to ensure that the information encountered before and after an event boundary is encoded in different neuronal populations. Norepinephrine (NE) is thought to facilitate this network reorganization. However, it is unknown whether event boundaries drive NE release in the hippocampus and, if so, how NE release relates to changes in hippocampal firing patterns. The advent of the new GRABNE sensor now allows for the measurement of NE binding with sub-second resolution. Using this tool in mice, we tested whether NE is released into the dorsal hippocampus during event boundaries defined by unexpected transitions between spatial contexts and presentations of novel objections. We found that NE binding dynamics were well explained by the time elapsed after each of these environmental changes, and were not related to conditioned behaviors, exploratory bouts of movement, or reward. Familiarity with a spatial context accelerated the rate in which phasic NE binding decayed to baseline. Knowing when NE is elevated, we tested how hippocampal coding of space differs during these moments. Immediately after context transitions we observed relatively unique patterns of neural spiking which settled into a modal state at a similar rate in which NE returned to baseline. These results are consistent with a model wherein NE release drives hippocampal representations away from a steady-state attractor. We hypothesize that the distinctive neural codes observed after each event boundary may facilitate long-term memory and contribute to the neural basis for the primacy effect.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

However, the unique visual diets individuals are exposed to across their lifetimes should sculpt very personal notions of typicality. Here, we thus investigated whether scenes that are more typical to individual observers are more accurately perceived and represented in the brain. We used drawings to enable participants to describe typical scenes (e.g., a kitchen) and converted these drawings into 3D renders. These renders were used as stimuli in a scene categorization task, during which we recorded EEG. In line with previous findings, categorization was most accurate for renders resembling the typical scene drawings of individual participants. Our EEG analyses reveal two critical insights on how these individual differences emerge on the neural level: First, personally typical scenes yielded enhanced neural representations from around 200 ms after onset. Second, personally typical scenes were represented in idiosyncratic ways, with reduced dependence on high-level visual features. We interpret these findings in a predictive processing framework, where individual differences in internal models of scene categories formed through experience shape visual analysis in idiosyncratic ways.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

Methods: We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to investigate associations between excitatory and inhibitory cortico-spinal excitability measures and the capacity to acquire a novel motor skill with the most affected hand in 103 individuals with cortical (n=34) or subcortical (n=69) lesions. Results: Both groups showed similar motor skill acquisition, but subcortical lesions exhibited more impairment in the most affected hand and lower excitability in the ipsilesional hemisphere. In cortical lesions, motor skill acquisition was associated with lower motor thresholds (?=-0.25, 95% CI [-0.47,-0.03]; p=0.024) and higher intracortical inhibition (?=-3.93, 95% CI [-6.89,-0.98]; p=0.011) in the ipsilesional hemisphere. In contrast, in subcortical lesions motor skill acquisition was associated with smaller motor evoked potentials (?=-4.46, 95% CI [-8.54,-0.38]; p=0.033), less intracortical inhibition (?=3.45, 95% CI [0.34,6.56]; p=0.030) and higher facilitation (?=1.34,95% CI [0.15,2.54]; p= 0.028) ipsilesionally. Sensitivity analyses revealed that associations with intracortical inhibition and facilitation in the subcortical group were driven by lesions affecting the corticospinal tract. No associations were found in the contralesional hemisphere. Conclusions: Reinforcing the existence of lesion-specific neurophysiological patterns, individuals with cortical and subcortical lesions show divergent associations between cortico-spinal excitability and motor skill acquisition. The use of cortico-spinal excitability as a biomarker to predict upper-limb recovery post-stroke or guide motor recovery interventions such as non-invasive brain stimulation should consider lesion location.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

Here, we report the discovery of yet another mode of phosphorylation - protein oligophosphorylation. Using site-specifically phosphorylated and pyrophosphorylated nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NME1), the effects of these modifications on enzyme activity were investigated. Phosphorylation, and more so pyrophosphorylation, on threonine 94 notably reduced the nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity. Nevertheless, both phosphoprotein and pyrophosphoprotein were able to catalyze their own oligophosphorylation - up to the formation of a hexaphosphate chain - using ATP as a co-factor. This reaction was critically dependent on the catalytic histidine residue H118, and cryo-EM analysis of the differently modified proteins suggests an intramolecular phosphoryl transfer, likely via a phosphohistidine intermediate. Oligophosphorylation of NME1 in biochemical samples, as well as cell lysates, was further confirmed using mass spectrometry, and oligophophorylation promoted a new set of protein interactions. Our results highlight the complex nature of phosphoregulation, and the methods described here provide the opportunity to investigate the impact of this novel modification in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

While the majority of germline-expressed RNAi pathway components reside in perinuclear germ granules, it is unknown whether and how RNAi pathways are spatially organized in other cell types. Here we find that the small RNA biogenesis machinery is spatially and temporally organized during embryogenesis. Specifically, the RNAi factor, SIMR-1, forms visible concentrates during mid-embryogenesis that contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a poly-UG polymerase, and the unloaded nuclear Argonaute protein, NRDE-3. Further, we observe that many other RNAi factors form foci in embryonic cells distinct from SIMR granules, including the Argonaute protein CSR-1, underscoring a potential role for cytoplasmic concentrates of RNAi factors to promote gene regulation in embryos. Curiously, coincident with the appearance of the ""SIMR granules"", the small RNAs bound to NRDE-3 switch from predominantly CSR-class 22G-RNAs to ERGO-dependent 22G-RNAs. Thus, our study defines two separable roles for NRDE-3, targeting germline-expressed genes during early embryogenesis and switching later in embryogenesis to repress recently duplicated genes and retrotransposons in somatic cells, highlighting the plasticity of Argonaute proteins and the need for more precise temporal characterization of Argonaute-small RNA interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

Recent evidence suggests that these waves directionality and spatiotemporal extent encode cognitive processes, yet the encoding mechanism related to their frequency remains unclear.

We explore the hypothesis that coherence frequency dictates the velocity of wave propagation. Using nonlinear coherence analysis to compute propagation pathways among four local-field-potential signals collected along the human hippocampuss long axis, we present evidence that the coherence frequency of traveling waves encodes temporal communication aspects. Unlike linear analyses, which may overestimate velocities due to bidirectional flow when considering multiple pair coherences, nonlinear analysis treats pathways as holistic units with affectively unidirectional flow, making it more suitable for calculating wave velocities. Our findings reveal that propagation velocities along the hippocampus at low frequencies (<[~]35Hz) demonstrate a linear dependency on frequency, with an increased slope at higher frequencies, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Although observed within the hippocampus, these findings capture a dependency between frequency and velocity of traveling waves which may be applicable to other cortical areas as well.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

Here, we investigate the nature of representations underlying object recognition in older compared to younger adults by tracking them in time using EEG, across space using fMRI, and by probing their behavioral relevance using similarity judgements. Applying a multivariate analysis framework to combine experimental assessments, four key findings about how brain aging impacts object recognition emerge. First, aging selectively delays the formation of object representations, profoundly changing the chronometry of visual processing. Second, the delay in the formation of object representations emerges in high-level rather than low- and mid-level ventral visual cortex, supporting the theory that brain areas developing last deteriorate first. Third, aging reduces content selectivity in high-level ventral visual cortex, indicating age-related neural dedifferentiation as the mechanism of representational change. Finally, we demonstrate that the identified representations of the aging brain are behaviorally relevant, ascertaining ecological relevance. Together, our results reveal the impact of healthy aging on the visual brain.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

The low abundance of HLA-I peptides poses significant technical challenges for their identification and accurate quantification. While mass spectrometry (MS) is currently a method of choice for direct system-wide identification of cellular immunopeptidome, there is still a need for enhanced sensitivity in detecting and quantifying tumor specific epitopes. As gas phase separation in data-dependent MS data acquisition (DDA) increased HLA-I peptide detection by up to 50%, here, we aimed to evaluate the performance of data-independent acquisition (DIA) in combination with ion mobility (diaPASEF) for high-sensitivity identification of HLA presented peptides. Our streamlined diaPASEF workflow enabled identification of 11,412 unique peptides from 12.5 million A375 cells and 3,426 8-11mers from as low as 500,000 cells with high reproducibility. By taking advantage of HLA binder-specific in-silico predicted spectral libraries, we were able to further increase the number of identified HLA-I peptides. We applied SILAC-DIA to a mixture of labeled HLA-I peptides, calculated heavy-to-light ratios for 7,742 peptides across 5 conditions and demonstrated that diaPASEF achieves high quantitative accuracy up to 4-fold dilution. Finally, we identified and quantified shared neoantigens in a monoallelic C1R cell line model. By spiking in heavy synthetic peptides, we verified the identification of the peptide sequences and calculated relative abundances for 13 neoantigens. Taken together, diaPASEF analysis workflows for HLA-I peptides can increase the peptidome coverage for lower sample amounts. The sensitivity and quantitative precision provided by DIA can enable the detection and quantification of less abundant peptide species such as neoantigens across samples from the same background.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

Since genetic associations are identified relative to the population mean, inevitably differences in disease or trait prevalence among social strata influence the relationship between PGS and risk. Here we quantify the magnitude of PGS-by-Exposure (PGSxE) interactions for seven human diseases (coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity thresholded to body mass index and to waist-to-hip ratio, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, and asthma) and pairs of 75 exposures in the White-British subset of the UK Biobank study (n=408,801). Across 24,198 PGSxE models, 746 (3.1%) were significant by two criteria, at least three-fold more than expected by chance under each criterion. Predictive accuracy is significantly improved in the high-risk exposures and by including interaction terms with effects as large as those documented for low transferability of PGS across ancestries. The predominant mechanism for PGSxE interactions is shown to be amplification of genetic effects in the presence of adverse exposures such as low polyunsaturated fatty acids, mediators of obesity, and social determinants of ill health. We introduce the notion of the proportion needed to benefit (PNB) which is the cumulative number needed to treat across the range of the PGS and show that typically this is halved in the 70th to 80th percentile. These findings emphasize how individuals experiencing adverse exposures stand to preferentially benefit from interventions that may reduce risk, and highlight the need for more comprehensive sampling across socioeconomic groups in the performance of genome-wide association studies.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

The timeline of human developmental circuits is well known. It is unclear how such timelines compare to those in mice. We lack age alignments across the lifespan of mice and humans. Here, we build upon our Translating Time resource, which is a tool that equates corresponding ages during development. We collected 477 time points (n=1,132 observations) from age-related changes in body, bone, dental, and brain processes to equate corresponding ages across humans and mice. We acquired high-resolution diffusion MR scans of mouse brains (n=12) at sequential stages of postnatal development (postnatal day 3, 4, 12, 21, 60) to trace the timeline of brain circuit maturation (e.g., olfactory association pathway, corpus callosum). We found heterogeneity in white matter pathway growth. The corpus callosum largely ceases to grow days after birth while the olfactory association pathway grows through P60. We found that a P3 mouse equates to a human at roughly GW24, and a P60 mouse equates to a human in teenage years. Therefore, white matter pathway maturation is extended in mice as it is in humans, but there are species-specific adaptations. For example, olfactory-related wiring is protracted in mice, which is linked to their reliance on olfaction. Our findings underscore the importance of translational tools to map common and species-specific biological processes from model systems to humans.

Significance statementMice are essential models of human brain development, but we currently lack precise age alignments across their lifespan. Here, we equate corresponding ages across mice and humans. We utilize high-resolution diffusion mouse brain scans to track the growth of brain white matter pathways, and we use our cross-species age alignments to map the timeline of these growth patterns from mouse to humans. In mice, olfactory association pathway growth continues well into the equivalent of human teenage years. The protracted development of olfactory association pathways in mice aligns with their specialized sense of smell. The generation of translational tools bridges the gap between animal models and human biology while enhancing our understanding of developmental processes generating variation across species.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

In this work we examine the episomal maintenance of a virus within a Salinibacter ruber host. We found that infected cultures of Sal. ruber M1 developed a population-level resistance and underwent systematic and reproducible recovery post infection that was counter-intuitively dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI), where higher MOI led to better host outcomes. Furthermore, we developed a nonlinear population dynamics model that successfully reproduced the qualitative features of the recovery. This suggests that the maintenance of the virus episomally, often referred to as pseudolysogeny, and lysis inhibition allow for host-virus co-existence under high MOI infections. Our results emphasize the ecological importance of exploring a spectrum of viral infection strategies beyond the conventional binary of lysis or lysogeny.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036681

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036681

The precise mechanisms by which normal stromal cell states limit tissue plasticity and tumorigenesis, and which are lost during tumor progression, remain largely unknown. Here we show that healthy pancreatic mesenchyme expresses the paracrine signaling molecule KITL, also known as stem cell factor, and identify loss of stromal KITL during tumorigenesis as tumor-promoting. Genetic inhibition of mesenchymal KITL in the contexts of homeostasis, injury, and cancer together indicate a role for KITL signaling in maintenance of pancreas tissue architecture, such that loss of the stromal KITL pool increased tumor growth and reduced survival of tumor-bearing mice. Together, these findings implicate loss of mesenchymal KITL as a mechanism for establishing a tumor-permissive microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

Though technologies such as long-read sequencing have facilitated the development of more accurate SV calling methods, existing somatic SV callers still struggle with achieving high precision. In this work, we present colorSV, a long-read-based method for calling long-range SVs by examining the local topology of joint assembly graphs from matched tumor-normal samples. colorSV is the first somatic SV calling method that uses a co-assembly approach, as well as the first SV caller that identifies variants by examining characteristics of the assembly graph itself. We demonstrate near-perfect precision and sensitivity for calling translocations on the COLO829 cell line, outperforming four existing somatic SV callers (Severus, Sniffles2, nanomonsv, and SAVANA) in both metrics. We also evaluated colorSV for calling translocations on the HCC1395 cell line, finding that our method achieved a good balance between sensitivity and precision (where the sensitivity was only outperformed by Severus, and the precision was only outperformed by nanomonsv). Our work establishes a novel joint assembly-based strategy for characterizing long-range somatic variation, which could be further expanded or modified for the identification of SVs of different types and sizes.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

Cellulose is thought to be assembled by the closely coordinated motion of plasma membrane-embedded cellulose synthase enzyme complexes. To date, however, it has not been possible to visualize de novo plant cell wall synthesis at the single cell level with the necessary spatiotemporal resolution to derive a data-driven model of how plant cells can resynthesize and assemble cell wall after its removal. Based on our time-resolved data, we propose a new model for cellulose biosynthesis after successfully performing live protoplast time-lapse imaging to visualize for the first time the complex dynamics of de novo cellulose biosynthesis and assembly into an intertwined microfibril network.

Plant cell walls are composed of polysaccharides among which cellulose is the most abundant component. Cellulose is processively synthesized as bundles of linear {beta}-1,4-glucan homopolymer chains via the coordinated action of multiple enzymes in cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) embedded within the plasma cell membrane. Plant cell walls are composed of multiple layers of cellulose fibrils that form highly intertwined extracellular matrix networks. However, it is not yet clear as to how cellulose fibrils synthesized by multiple CSCs are assembled into the intricate cellulose network deposited on plant cell surfaces. Herein, we have established an in vivo time-resolved imaging platform for visualizing cellulose during its biosynthesis and assembly into a complex fibrillar network on the surface of Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll protoplasts as the primary cell wall regenerates. We performed total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) with fluorophore-conjugated tandem carbohydrate binding modules (tdCBMs) that were engineered to specifically bind to nascent cellulose fibrils. Together with a well-controlled environment, it was possible to monitor in vivo cellulose fibril synthesis dynamics in a time-resolved manner for nearly one day of continuous cell wall regeneration on protoplast cell surfaces. Our observations provide the basis for a novel model of cellulose fibril network development in protoplasts driven by complex interplay of multi-scale dynamics that include: rapid diffusion and coalescence of short nascently synthesized cellulose fibrils; processive elongation of single fibrils; and cellulose fibrillar network rearrangement during cell wall maturation. This platform is valuable for exploring mechanistic aspects of cell wall synthesis while visualizing cellulose microfibrils assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

Due to their rarity compared to other malignancies in these organs, their complex biology remains poorly understood, including their oncogenesis, tumor composition and the intriguing phenomena of mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN). Here we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) tumor samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology. Taken together, our results provide important insights and hypotheses regarding the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

An obstacle to predicting, monitoring and understanding the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy cachexia is that each cancer (and sub-type) is assigned different chemotherapeutic compounds, typically in multi-agent regimens. Here, we investigate the chemotherapy induction regimen (CIR) used in haematological cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We hypothesized that the AML CIR would induce cachexia, including loss of lean tissue mass and skeletal muscle atrophy.

MethodsUsing an unbiased proteomics approach we interrogated the underlying molecular mechanisms. 3-month-old male Balb/c mice were treated with the AML CIR via intraperitoneal injections of daunorubicin (1.7 mg/kg) on days 1-3, and cytarabine (33.2 mg/kg) administered on days 1-7 or vehicle. Mice were assessed 24 hours after the last treatment, on day 8, or allowed to recover for 2 weeks and assessed on day 22. A third cohort were given access to running wheels in cages. We assessed body composition, whole body metabolism and assessed the muscle proteome using quantitative tandem mass tag labelling LC-MS/MS analysis.

ResultsThe AML CIR induced acute cachexia involving a [~]13% loss of body mass, [~]9% loss of lean mass and [~]10% reduction in skeletal muscle fibre size. Whole body metabolism and ambulatory activity declined. This cachexic phenotype did not recover over the 2-week post-CIR period (lean mass loss post-CIR: 1-week [~]7% vs 2-weeks [~]9%). In voluntarily active CIR-treated mice, body wasting was exacerbated due to unchecked loss of fat mass (CIR sedentary: [~]31% vs CIR active: [~]51%). Muscle proteome studies revealed upregulation of haptoglobin (Hp) and glutamine synthetase (Glul), which were positively correlated with body and lean mass loss. Hp was sensitive to the conditional induction, recovery and exacerbation of AML CIR-mediated cachexia, suggestive of biomarker potential.

ConclusionsThe AML CIR induces an acute reduction of body, lean and fat mass underpinned by skeletal muscle atrophy, hypermetabolism and catabolism. Our data uncovered a conditionally sensitive muscle biomarker in Hp, which may be useful as a prognostic tool across other scenarios of chemotherapy-induced myopathy and cachexia or as a target for therapeutic discovery in follow up studies.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

Here, we utilized subcellular-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses wild-type human -synuclein (-syn-tg) to evaluate patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to -synuclein pathology. By performing post-IST immunofluorescence for -synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 (pSyn), we identified cell types in the cortex and hippocampus that were vulnerable or resistant to developing pSyn pathology. Next, we investigated the transcriptional underpinnings of the observed selective vulnerability using a set of custom probes to detect genes involved in -synuclein processing and toxicity. We identified expression of the kinase:substrate pair Plk2, which phosphorylates -synuclein at Ser129, and human SNCA (hSNCA), as underlying the selective vulnerability to pSyn pathology. Finally, we performed differential gene expression analysis, comparing non-transgenic cells to pSyn- and pSyn+ -syn- tg cells to reveal gene expression changes downstream of hSNCA overexpression and pSyn pathology, which included pSyn-dependent alterations in mitochondrial and endolysosomal genes. This study provides a comprehensive use case of IST, yielding new biological insights into the formation of -synuclein pathology and its downstream effects in a PD/DLB mouse model.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

While RNAi mediates antiviral innate immunity in plants and many invertebrates, vertebrates adopted sequence-independent response and their Dicer produces siRNAs inefficiently because it is adapted to process small hairpin microRNA precursors in the gene-regulating microRNA pathway. Mammalian RNAi is thus a rudimentary pathway of unclear significance. To investigate its antiviral potential, we modified mouse Dicer locus to express a truncated variant (Dicer{Delta}HEL1) known to stimulate RNAi. Next, we analyzed how Dicer{Delta}HEL1/wt mice respond to four RNA viruses: Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV) from Picornaviridae; tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) from Flaviviridae; and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) from Arenaviridae. Increased Dicer activity in Dicer{Delta}HEL1/wt mice did not elicit any antiviral effect supporting insignificant antiviral function of endogenous mammalian RNAi in vivo. However, we also report that sufficiently high expression of Dicer{Delta}HEL1 suppressed LCMV in embryonic stem cells and in a transgenic mouse model. Altogether, mice with increased Dicer activity offer a new benchmark for identifying and studying viruses susceptible to mammalian RNAi in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

We thus lack a mechanistic framework that links functional adaptability with environmental pressures. Here, we leverage the diversity of natural tubulin variants from three closely related frog species that live at different temperatures: we combine in vitro reconstitution assays, quantitative biochemistry, and cryogenic electron microscopy to show how a small number of primary sequence changes influences the energy landscape of tubulin interactions and thereby mediates cold-adaptation and microtubule stability.

Previous stable oxygen isotope studies suggested that several taxa belonging to these groups were endothermic and for some of them homeothermic organisms. However, these conclusions remain contentious owing to the associated uncertainties regarding the {delta}18O value and oxygen isotope fractionation relative to environmental sea water. Here, we present new hydroxylapatite phosphate {delta}18O values ({delta}18Op) of Ichthyosauria, Plesiosauria and Metriorhynchidae (Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous) recovered from mid- to high-paleolatitudes to better constrain their thermophysiology and investigate the presence of regional heterothermies. The intra-skeletal {delta}18Op variability failed to reveal distinct heterothermic patterns within any of the specimens, indicating either intra-body temperature homogeneity or an overriding diagenetic overprint of the original biological {delta}18Op bone record. Body temperature estimates have then been reassessed from new and published {delta}18Op values of well-preserved isolated teeth, recently revised Mesozoic latitudinal {delta}18O oceanic gradient and 18O-enrichment factor of fully aquatic air-breathing vertebrates. Our results confirm that Ichthyosauria were homeothermic endotherms (31{degrees}C to 41{degrees}C), while Plesiosauria were likely poikilothermic endotherms (27{degrees}C to 34{degrees}C). The new body temperature estimates of the Metriorhynchidae (25{degrees}C to 32{degrees}C) closely follow ambient temperatures and point to poikilothermic strategy with no or little endothermic abilities. These results improve our understanding of Mesozoic marine reptile thermoregulation and indicate that due to their limited body temperature variations, the {delta}18Op values from Ichthyosauria fossil remains could be used as valuable archives of Mesozoic oceans {delta}18Osw values that may help improve palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstructions.

Non-technical abstractSome marine reptiles from the Mesozoic such as ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and metriorhynchids, were capable of reaching elevated body temperatures and for some of them to maintain it few degrees above that of their marine environment, a characteristic similar to that observed in modern cetaceans. Nevertheless, the estimation of their body temperature from the chemical oxygen signature of their fossil remains (bones and teeth) is accompanied by uncertainties associated with the chemical oxygen signature of the surrounding water and the mineralisation processes of the bones and teeth. In this study, new data were collected from four ichthyosaurs, three plesiosaurs and one metriorhynchid in order to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which these marine reptiles were able to maintain a body temperature higher than that of their environment. The chemical signatures of oxygen in the bones and teeth of the specimens did not exhibit any discernible patterns indicative of specific zones of heat production or loss, as observed in modern marine vertebrates. Concurrently, we reassessed the estimated body temperature of these marine reptiles, thereby corroborating the hypothesis that ichthyosaurs were homeothermic endotherms. Conversely, our novel estimates suggest that plesiosaurs were likely poikilothermic endotherms, whereas metriorhynchids were probably also poikilothermic endotherms but with a limited capacity for heat production. Finally, the narrow range of body temperatures maintained by ichthyosaurs indicates that the oxygen chemical signature of fossilised remains could serve as a valuable marker for reconstructing variations in the oxygen isotope composition of the Mesozoic oceans, paving the way to enhance our understanding of the environment and climate of this period in Earths history.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

When compared to meiotic maturation, relatively little is known about the key processes that happen in growing oocytes. Since the first visualization of oocyte chromatin under the electron microscope, we have known that growing oocytes undergo a fundamental transition from the non-surrounded nucleolus (NSN) to surrounded nucleolus (SN) chromatin configuration. NSN-to-SN transition is crucial for subsequent embryonic development after fertilization, but what drives NSN-to-SN transition during mammalian oocyte development is still unknown. Here we show that natural degradation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) by segregase and proteasome drives NSN-to-SN transition, challenging the conventional view that transcriptional silencing and NSN-to-SN transition are driven by independent epigenetic mechanisms in mammalian oocytes.

The final step of oocyte growth, which reorganizes chromatin from the uncondensed, non-surrounded nucleolus (NSN) configuration to the condensed, surrounded nucleolus (SN) configuration, is essential for embryonic development after fertilization. However, the mechanism of NSN-to-SN transition remains unknown. Here, we identify RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) degradation as the key driver of this process. RNAPII inhibitors, but not nucleoside-based transcription inhibitors, swiftly induced RNAPII degradation and NSN-to-SN transition in oocytes. Strikingly, induced SN-like nuclei recapitulated epigenetic features, chromatin interactions and developmental potential in SN oocytes. Using segregase and proteasome inhibitors and the newly established scFv miniTrim-Away for nuclear proteins, we further demonstrate that RNAPII degradation is necessary and sufficient for NSN-to-SN transition in mouse and human. RNAPII degradation globally cleared RNAPII from transcriptionally active chromatin and increased chromatin dynamics, concomitantly leading to transcriptional silencing and chromatin rearrangement in oocytes. Our study elucidates the framework of chromatin reorganization in growing mammalian oocytes and provides an alternative source of fully grown oocyte nuclei, representing a milestone for the potential use of growing oocytes in reproductive medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

However, the contribution of genetic risk within astrocytes to cellular processes relevant to the pathogenesis of AD remains ill-defined. Here we present a resource for studying AD genetic risk in astrocytes using a large collection of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from deeply phenotyped individuals with a range of neuropathological and cognitive outcomes. IPSC lines from forty-four individuals were differentiated into astrocytes followed by unbiased molecular profiling using RNA sequencing and tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the utility of this resource in examining gene- and pathway-level associations with clinical and neuropathological traits, as well as in analyzing genetic risk and resilience factors through parallel analyses of iPSC-astrocytes and brain tissue from the same individuals. Our analyses reveal that genes and pathways altered in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD individuals are concordantly dysregulated in AD brain tissue. This includes increased prefoldin proteins, extracellular matrix factors, COPI-mediated trafficking components and reduced proteins involved in cellular respiration and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, iPSC-derived astrocytes from individuals resilient to high AD neuropathology show elevated basal levels of interferon response proteins and increased secretion of interferon gamma.

MultiMIL effectively integrates single-cell modalities, even when they only partially overlap, providing robust representations for downstream analyses such as phenotypic prediction and cell prioritization. Using a multiple-instance learning approach, MultiMIL aggregates cell-level measurements into sample-level representations and identifies disease-specific cell states through attention-based scoring.

In response to infection, TIRs can produce a cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (ADPR) signaling molecule, which activates an effector that depletes the host of the essential metabolite NAD+ to limit phage propagation. How bacterial TIRs recognize phage infection is not known. Here we describe the sensing mechanism for the staphylococcal Thoeris defense system, which consists of two TIR domain sensors, ThsB1 and ThsB2, and the effector ThsA. We show that the major capsid protein of phage {Phi}80 forms a complex with ThsB1 and ThsB2, which is sufficient for the synthesis of 1-3 glycocyclic ADPR (gcADPR) and subsequent activation of NAD+ cleavage by ThsA. Consistent with this, phages that escape Thoeris immunity harbor mutations in the capsid that prevent complex formation. We show that capsid proteins from staphylococcal Siphoviridae belonging to the capsid serogroup B, but not A, are recognized by ThsB1/B2, a result that suggests that capsid recognition by Sau-Thoeris and other anti-phage defense systems may be an important evolutionary force behind the structural diversity of prokaryotic viruses. More broadly, since mammalian toll-like receptors harboring TIR domains can also recognize viral structural components to produce an inflammatory response against infection, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism for the activation of innate antiviral defense pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, [1]) is a novel enzyme-tethering method for epigenomic profiling, initially developed for mammalian cells. CUT&Tag has several advantages compared to the most commonly used epigenomic profiling methods such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). CUT&Tag allows epigenenomic profiling from a much less amount of starting material compared to ChIP-seq. CUT&Tag is based on the in situ cleavage of DNA by enzymes tethered to antibodies, while in ChIP-seq, the cleavage is done by a nearly random fragmentation step. In theory, this difference in the way of cleaving DNA allows CUT&Tag to reach a higher resolution compared to ChIP-seq. Therefore, CUT&Tag holds the potential to profile the genome-wide distribution at a high resolution even from a small amount of plant tissues.

ResultsWe profiled the genome-wide distribution of three histone modifications, H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, from a few seedlings of Arabidopsis that weighed around 0.01 grams. By comparing the H3K27me3 profiles generated from ChIP-seq and CUT&Tag, we showed that CUT&Tag and ChIP-seq capture the same broad lines of the epigenomes, but they also revealed different sets of peaks. Analysis using the CUT&Tag datasets for the three histone modifications revealed their genomic locations and their relationship with the gene expression level, which are consistent with the expected effect of these histone marks on gene transcription. By comparing to the nucleosome occupancy data, we show that CUT&Tag reached nucleosomal resolution, a much higher resolution than ChIP-seq. In the end, we presented that the increased resolution of CUT&Tag could better reveal the exon enrichment of histone modifications and the epigenetic states of the +1 nucleosome, showing benefits and advantages that this technique could bring to the field of plant epigenetics and chromatin study in general.

ConclusionCUT&Tag is a valid, easy-to-perform, cost-effective, and reliable approach for efficient epigenomic profiling in Arabidopsis, even with limited amount of starting material and provides a higher resolution compared to ChIP-seq. Because the CUT&Tag protocol starting input is isolated nuclei, it is also applicable to other model and non-model plants.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

Utilizing transcriptomic profiling, assessments of chromatin accessibility, mitochondrial phenotyping, and lipidomics analyses, we observed that SC-{beta} cells exhibit reduced oxidative and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism compared to primary human islets that are related to limitations in key mitochondrial transcriptional networks. Surprisingly, we found that reductions in glucose- stimulated mitochondrial respiration in SC-islets were not associated with alterations in mitochondrial mass, structure, or genome integrity. In contrast, SC-islets show limited expression of targets of PPARIZ and PPAR{gamma}, which regulate mitochondrial programming, yet whose functions in {beta} cell differentiation are unknown. Importantly, treatment with WY14643, a potent PPARIZ agonist, induced expression of mitochondrial targets, improved insulin secretion, and increased the formation and maturation of SC-{beta} cells both in vitro and following transplantation.

The most lethal manifestation is invasive aspergillosis for which treatment relies on triazoles. Triazole-resistant A. fumigatus can be recovered from decaying plant material and so-called hotspots containing triazole fungicide residues. Although observations have shown clonal isolates between the environment and clinical samples, a direct link between a specific environment and cases of triazole-resistant invasive aspergillus disease in an individual patient has not yet been demonstrated.

MethodsTo understand where patients acquire A. fumigatus isolates causing disease, we used a genomic epidemiology approach with 157 Dutch A. fumigatus isolates, based on whole genome sequencing. Isolates were from three well-characterized environmental hotspots and two hospitals between 2016 and 2019.

FindingsIn the Dutch dataset, A. fumigatus isolates from six patients showed near-identical genomes compared to five environmental isolates. One environmental isolate matched three probable cases of triazole-resistant invasive aspergillosis, including one fatal case. Patient isolates were recovered up to 34 months later than near-identical environmental isolates. Comparison to over 1{middle dot}2K global publicly available A. fumigatus genomes showed hundreds of clonal groups spread across three continents. In addition, finding variants associated with resistance to non-triazole fungicides such as benzimidazole, succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor and quinone outside inhibitor classes, strongly suggests an exposure history to multiple agricultural fungicides in these environmental hotspots.

InterpretationEnvironmental hotspots represent highly selective habitats for multi-fungicide-resistant A. fumigatus, which we can now directly link to probable cases of aspergillus disease, including a triazole-resistant case. However, geographically widely dispersed clonal expansion limits the utility of genomic epidemiology to identify the source of a particular patients isolate. Furthermore, reducing a single class of fungicides in agriculture may not effectively reduce resistance selection when other classes are still in use.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTriazole fungicides that exhibit activity against Aspergillus fumigatus have been shown to be a major source of resistant aspergillus disease in humans. However, the route of transmission from environmental hotspot to human remains poorly understood. Isolates of A. fumigatus can be recovered from both environmental samples and clinical specimens that harbour the same resistance signature haplotypes, e.g., TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A, in the cyp51A-gene. We searched the literature for evidence using high resolution whole genome sequencing (WGS) to link environmental isolates to human infection. We searched PubMed for articles using the search terms  Aspergillus fumigatus AND  azole resistance AND  whole genome sequencing on 15 April 2024. This search retrieved 32 articles describing different evolutionary routes to select for triazole-resistant A. fumigatus or population structure of whole-genome sequenced isolates. Twenty-six articles used whole-genome sequencing, but none focused on identifying clonal groups to identify direct cases of transmission between the environment and clinical cases of aspergillus disease. By using the additional search term  transmission, no other records were retrieved.

Added value of this studyOur study links triazole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates cultured from three environmental hotspots to cases of aspergillus disease in two hospitals in the Netherlands. Genome comparisons of isolates from environmental hotspots and patients showed multiple near-identical linked genotypes, consistent with a route of transmission from the environment to patients. Although a naive expectation may be a higher probability of matches of the hotspots located in the northwest of the Netherlands with the hospital located in the west of the country, in fact, more patient isolates from the far southeast were linked to the hotspots. Integrating the Dutch data set into a global data set showed 205 clonal groups spread across the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), the United States of America (USA) and Japan. Our demonstration of a large number of geographically dispersed clonal groups suggests that current sampling is insufficient to definitively identify the source of an individual patients infection. A genetically highly diverse population combined with a wide global distribution of clones can make it impossible to definitively identify the source of an individual patients infection even with much more sampling.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that triazole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates with multi-fungicide resistance profiles cause aspergillus disease in at-risk patients and may contribute to treatment failure and mortality. The risk of infection due to these triazole-resistant isolates is not confined to the geographic vicinity of the environmental hotspot since clonal spread can be detected across great distances. The finding of linked cases without clear transmission routes limits epidemiological studies and underscores the need to better understand the ecology and environmental niches of this fungus. As it is highly unlikely that each patient visited the rural agricultural areas where a hotspot was located, research should address the complex and long-distance transmission routes of resistant isolates, which involves airborne dispersal of conidia or habitats of this fungus outside the agricultural environment. Furthermore, because of the multi-fungicide resistance phenotype of the triazole-resistant A. fumigatus, involving several classes of fungicides, reducing one class of fungicides in the environment may not effectively reduce resistance selection. Effective interventions should instead aim to reduce the burden of environmental resistance by modifying environments that currently favour the massive outgrowth of fungicide-resistant A. fumigatus to limit the escape of aerial spores from these environmental hotspots.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) has emerged as a powerful tool to elucidate the evolutionary history of protein families and identify sequence determinants of protein function. Here, we present AncFlow, an automated software pipeline that integrates phylogenetic analysis, subfamily identification, and ASR to generate ancestral protein sequences for structural prediction using state-of-the-art tools like AlphaFold. AncFlow streamlines the process of ASR by combining multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree inference, subfamily identification, and ancestral sequence reconstruction from unaligned protein sequences. The reconstructed ancestral sequences are then subjected to structural prediction using AlphaFold, enabling the investigation of the structural basis of functional divergence within protein families. We validated AncFlow using two well-characterized protein families: acyltransferases and dehydrogenases. The pipeline successfully reconstructed ancestral sequences for multiple internal nodes of the phylogenetic trees, and their predicted structures were compared with those of extant proteins. By analyzing the structural similarities and differences between ancestral and extant proteins, we gained insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the functional diversification within these families. AncFlow demonstrates the potential of integrating ASR and structural prediction to unravel the structural basis of functional divergence in protein families. The insights gained from this approach can guide protein engineering efforts, facilitating the design of proteins with desired functions. As the amount of sequence data continues to grow, AncFlow provides a valuable tool for exploring the evolutionary landscape of proteins and accelerating the discovery of novel protein functions.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

Despite this progress, more biomarkers, ideally in blood, are needed for effective patient management and disease monitoring for Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

METHODSWe employed the Nucleic Acid-Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) central nervous system (CNS) panel for biomarker quantification in plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, Lewy body dementia, progranulin (GRN) mutation carriers and matched controls.

RESULTSNULISA identified p-tau217 and NfL as the most significantly deregulated plasma biomarkers in the AD continuum and GRN mutation carriers, respectively. Importantly, numerous novel and significant proteomic changes were observed in each disease comparison, which included proteins involved in synaptic processing, inflammation, microglial reactivity, TDP-43 and -synuclein pathology. Plasma and serum act as complimentary biofluids.

CONCLUSIONWe highlight the potential of next-generation biomarker identification tools, such as NULISA, to detect novel proteomic features that incorporate established biomarkers like p-tau217 and NfL. These findings highlight the importance of continued biomarker discovery to enhance patient management, improve treatment decisions, and better understand the complexities of neurodegenerative disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1722550036682

Recent technological advances in DNA sequencing-based assays have revealed locus- and chromatin state-specific structural patterns at the length scale of a few nucleosomes ([~]1 kb). However, interpreting these data sets remains challenging. Radiation-induced correlated cleavage of chromatin (RICC-seq) is one such chromatin structure assay that maps DNA-DNA-contacts at base pair resolution by sequencing single-stranded DNA fragments released from irradiated cells. Here, we develop a flexible modeling and simulation framework to enable the interpretation of RICC-seq data in terms of oligonucleosome structure ensembles. Nucleosomes are modeled as rigid bodies with excluded volume and adjustable DNA wrapping, connected by linker DNA modeled as a worm-like chain. We validate the models parameters against cryo-electron microscopy and sedimentation data. Our results show that RICC-seq is sensitive to nucleosome spacing, nucleosomal DNA wrapping, and the strength of inter-nucleosome interactions. We show that nucleosome repeat lengths consistent with orthogonal assays can be extracted from experimental RICC-seq data using a 1D convolutional neural net trained on RICC-seq signal predicted from simulated ensembles. We thus provide a suite of analysis tools that add quantitative structural interpretability to RICC-seq experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

A prominent example of a self-assembly process forming a structure whose size scales with cell size is Cdc42-driven cell polarization and subsequent septin ring formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms that determine Cdc42 cluster and septin ring size are still unclear. Combining computational modeling, live-cell imaging and genetic manipulations, we show here that positive feedback in the polarization pathway, together with the amount of polarity proteins increasing with cell size, can account for the increase of the Cdc42 cluster area with cell size, and as a consequence also the scaling of the septin ring diameter. We demonstrate that in bni1{Delta} cells, which have a larger septin ring compared to wild-type cells but a similarly sized Cdc42-GTP cluster, disruption of F-actin cable assembly and polarization toward the bud site results in diffuse exocytosis, causing septin ring enlargement. Furthermore, we find that in cells with impaired negative feedback in the polarization pathway, the Cdc42-GTP cluster area expands compared to wild-type cells, while the septin ring diameter remains mostly unchanged. This decoupling can be partially explained by a high recruitment rate of septin via polarity factors. Taken together, we provide insights into the origin of septin ring size control, in particular the scaling with cell volume, by integrating new experimental findings and mechanistic models of budding yeast polarization.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

However, designing such rhythmic patterns in synthetic cells remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of spatio-temporal oscillations in the number of droplets, size, and position within a synthetic cell. The coacervate-based droplets in these synthetic cells sediment and fuse at the cells bottom. Through a newly discovered size control mechanism, the sedimented, large droplets shrink by expelling droplet material. The expelled molecules nucleate new droplets at the top of the synthetic cell, which grow and sediment again. These oscillations are sustained by converting chemical fuel into waste and can continue for hundreds of periods without evidence of fatigue. Strikingly, the period of the oscillation is in the minutes regime and tunable. The design of oscillating organelles in synthetic cells brings us closer to creating more life-like materials and de novo life.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

Here, we estimate biological age of 11 organs from 44,526 individuals in the UK Biobank using an antibody-based proteomics platform to model disease and mortality risk. Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimers disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements. Remarkably, the accrual of aged organs progressively increases mortality risk while a youthful brain and immune system are uniquely associated with disease-free longevity. These findings support the use of plasma proteins for monitoring organ health and the efficacy of drugs targeting organ aging disease.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682

They form superhelical structures around which DNA is wrapped. Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1722550036682
