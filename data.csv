Some of these targets have been successfully resolved by binding to antibody fragments (Fabs) or fusing with external scaffolds to increase their size. Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an increasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889224

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map spontaneous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submembrane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889224

Genome language models have emerged as a promising strategy for designing biological systems, but their ability to generate functional sequences at the scale of whole genomes has remained untested. Here, we report the first generative design of viable bacteriophage genomes. We leveraged frontier genome language models, Evo 1 and Evo 2, to generate whole-genome sequences with realistic genetic architectures and desirable host tropism, using the lytic phage {Phi}X174 as our design template. Experimental testing of AI-generated genomes yielded 16 viable phages with substantial evolutionary novelty. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that one of the generated phages utilizes an evolutionarily distant DNA packaging protein within its capsid. Multiple phages demonstrate higher fitness than {Phi}X174 in growth competitions and in their lysis kinetics. A cocktail of the generated phages rapidly overcomes {Phi}X174-resistance in three E. coli strains, demonstrating the potential utility of our approach for designing phage therapies against rapidly evolving bacterial pathogens. This work provides a blueprint for the design of diverse synthetic bacteriophages and, more broadly, lays a foundation for the generative design of useful living systems at the genome scale.","[{""name"":""Arc Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00wra1b14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889224

The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus broadcasts the head-direction (HD) signal, which is generated in the brainstem, particularly in the upstream lateral mammillary nucleus, and thalamic HD cells remain coordinated even during sleep. Here, by recording and manipulating neuronal activity along the mammillary-thalamic-cortical pathway, we show that coherence among thalamic HD cells persists even when their upstream inputs are decorrelated, particularly during non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep.

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored 'transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) ' (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export(ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the 'Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) ' connection harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889224

Using fMRI and multivariate analyses, we tracked neural reinstatement of newly learned item-location-context associations in youth (N = 49; mean age = 11.68 years). Hippocampus and visual cortex activity during encoding predicted later memory success. Crucially, spontaneous reinstatement in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during post-encoding rest also predicted memory. In a second sample (N = 32, mean age = 12.86 years) with early adversity, differential recruitment of the precuneus and visual cortex during encoding, and angular gyrus during reinstatement, was observed. These findings suggest that hippocampus and mPFC contribute to developmental memory stabilization in ways consistent with mature function, while differences in memory accessibility across developmental experiences arise from broader network adaptations.","[{""name"":""New York State Psychiatric Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04aqjf708"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1F32HD114417;""},{""name"":""Brain & Behavior Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03a63f080"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NARSAD Young Investigator Grant (24739);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889224

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889224

YprA family helicases are central to widespread defense systems DISARM, Dpd, and Druantia. Here, through comprehensive phylogenetic and structural prediction analysis of the YprA family, we identify several major, previously unrecognized clades, with unique signatures of domain architecture and associations with other genes. Each YprA family clade defines a distinct class of defense systems, which we denote ARMADA (disARM-related Antiviral Defense Array), BRIGADE (Base hypermodification and Restriction Involving Genes encoding ARMADA-like and Dpd-like Effectors), or TALON (TOTE-like and ARMADA-Like Operon with Nuclease). In addition to the YprA-like helicase, ARMADA systems share two more proteins with DISARM. However, ARMADA YprA homologs are most similar to those of Druantia, suggesting ARMADA is a missing link connecting DISARM and Druantia. We show experimentally that ARMADA protects bacteria against a broad range of phages via a direct, non-abortive mechanism. We also discovered multiple families of satellite phage-like mobile genetic elements that often carry both ARMADA and Druantia Type III systems and show that these can provide synergistic resistance against diverse phages.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

While molecular screening of ChRs requires high-cost experiments, recent machine-learning-based protein functionality prediction enables more efficient selection of target proteins for characterization. Here, we constructed an elastic-net machine-learning model trained on 1,163 experimental data to predict the maximum absorption wavelength ({lambda}max) of uncharacterized ChRs.

We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium. Collectively, our results suggest that hierarchical sensory processing across topographically organized pallial regions is a conserved functional feature of the vertebrate pallium.","[{""name"":""JSPS KAKENHI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP24K02008;""},{""name"":""European Horizon Marie-Curie individual postdoctoral fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101066743;""},{""name"":""NFR FRIPRO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""239973;314212;""},{""name"":""RCN Centres of Excellence scheme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""332640;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

Biopsies from the oral mucosa were collected at oral cGVHD onset or at six months post-transplant and analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing and other modalities. At cGVHD onset, in addition to changes in the myeloid compartment, two distinct populations of CD8+T cells with a TEXEF phenotype were prevalent: an inflammatory CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_4) expressing CCL4, CD69, and TNFSF9, and an exhausted CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_5) characterized by the expression of CXCL13, HIF1A, and HLA-DRA, both correlated with clinical disease severity. Pseudo-time analysis suggests a transition from the inflammatory pre-exhausted CD8T_4 cluster to the cytolytic, terminally exhausted CD8T_5 cluster. The CXCL9-CXCR3 interactions among CD8+ T cells, fibroblasts and myeloid cells are implicated in tissue damage.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating-type switching is a central feature of the life cycle that enables homothallism, i.e., mating between mitotic descendants of the same haploid cell. Yet heterothallic isolates that have lost this ability are found across diverse niches, indicating that this trait is polymorphic. Here we experimentally characterized loss of mating-type switching in a representative panel of strains. Analysis of 117 telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies revealed multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in the Ho endonuclease gene and structural variants in the silent HML and HMR cassettes, the three loci essential for switching. We estimated that at least 13 independent transitions from homothallism to heterothallism have occurred in the species history. Analysis of the HO genotype of 2,915 strains show that at least 27% are heterothallic. We found that heterothallism is strongly associated with polyploidy and elevated genome-wide heterozygosity, although the strength of these associations varies between populations. Heterothallic isolates are most prevalent in domesticated and clinical clades, consistent with an origin linked to human-associated environments. However, they are also found, though less frequently, in natural niches. Signatures of recombination in HO sequences suggest that outcrossing contributed to the ecological and geographical distribution of the trait. Our findings reveal that mating-type switching has undergone repeated losses in S. cerevisiae evolution, with major consequences for genome architecture and ecological diversification.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE12-0020;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

This study investigates the transcriptional effects of music exposure in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using this non-invasive approach. To address saliva-specific limitations, we employed two complementary library preparation methods, Poly-A selection and Human-Enriched protocols, allowing us to maximize human transcript detection and ensure reproducibility. By merging them, we ensured reproducibility and captured both host and microbial signals. While each dataset individually revealed a limited number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), their integration enhanced biological resolution. Among the consistently modulated genes were HERC6, TSPAN5, and REM2, pointing to music-induced transcriptional changes relevant to neurodevelopmental and immune processes. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted pathways involved in immune regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, and epithelial differentiation. These findings align with evidence of immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered cellular communication in ASD. Importantly, co-expression network analysis identified modules significantly correlated with music exposure. Notably, the AKNA module, previously associated with ASD risk, was downregulated and enriched for Ras-related GTPase signaling and immune pathways, suggesting that music may modulate intracellular signaling and inflammation. Conversely, upregulation of the UBE2D3 module pointed to activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress response mechanisms, a known contributor to ASD neurodevelopmental deficits. These results suggest that music engages specific stress-adaptive and immunomodulatory networks in buccal cells, potentially reflecting systemic effects. Our exploratory metagenomic analysis highlights 15 microbial species with consistent abundance shifts across both methods. Notably, Acidipropionibacterium acidipropionici and Propionibacterium freudenreichii, associated with propionic acid production, emerged as music-responsive taxa. Elevated propionic acid has been implicated in ASD-like behaviors and neuroinflammation, suggesting a microbiota-mediated pathway. Music may influence both host gene expression and oral microbiota, potentially affecting neuroimmune processes via the microbiota-brain axis. Although exploratory, the results support the feasibility of using saliva for integrated molecular profiling in ASD.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

In our study, we developed an in vitro model of cell coated micro-sized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) which allows to decipher the interplay between cellular activities and tissue mechanics. Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of fluid transport in generating mechanical forces within epithelial tissues. Supported by a theoretical mechano-hydraulic model, a mechanistic framework for understanding the intricate interplay between cellular processes and tissue mechanics was established. These results challenge traditional views of epithelial tissue mechanics, emphasizing the pivotal influence of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping tissues. We anticipate that this study will advance the understanding of epithelial tissue development, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying pathological conditions.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Adv-101019835;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0071;DFG-ANR-22-CE92-0048;ANR-10-INBS-04;""},{""name"":""Institut National Du Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03m8vkq32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INCa_16712;INCa_18429;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Alexander von Humboldt Professorship;""},{""name"":""La Ligue Contre le Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rkrv905"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Equipe labellisee 2029;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ChR024 in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs at resolutions of 3.2 and 2.5 [A], respectively. The structures reveal an architecture strikingly similar to that of ion-pumping rhodopsins, even more so than other pump-like channelrhodopsins such as ChRmine. Structural, theoretical, and spectroscopic analyses uncover a unique color-tuning mechanism, in which charged residues close and distant from the retinal chromophore cooperatively modulate the pKa of the Schiff base counterion and thereby determine the absorption maximum wavelength. Finally, comparative structural analysis of channel- and pump-type rhodopsins, combined with electrophysiology, provides insights into the molecular boundary between these two functional classes and demonstrates the conversion of an outward proton pump into a light-gated channel. Together, these findings illuminate diverse mechanisms of color tuning and functional specification within the rhodopsin family, paving the way for the rational engineering of next-generation optogenetic tools.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

VirScan revealed unique viral exposure histories for each individual. At the antibody level, we observed strong protein-level immunodominance, with viral surface proteins consistently recognized across individuals, but striking variability at the epitope level, even within immunodominant proteins. At the functional level, differential protein expression analysis showed that prior infection with HSV-1, HSV-2, or norovirus was associated with elevated production of CCL4, MCP-2, and TNF, respectively, following TLR7/8 stimulation, indicating virus-specific imprints on innate immune responses. Together, these findings suggest that both chronic and acute viral infections are major drivers of immune variation and can leave lasting signatures on innate function. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of broad viral serology with systems-level innate profiling to investigate how lifetime exposures shape human immune variability.

Although these datasets contain rich information on drug resistance, they are both complex and multivariate, with each isolates susceptibility measured across several antibiotics. Current analytical methods for these datasets overwhelmingly focus on genotypes, while tools to study multivariate resistance phenotypes-the direct targets of selection and clinical intervention-remain severely limited. To address this gap, we develop Antimicrobial Resistance Cartography, a set of methods for interpreting high-dimensional drug resistance in large isolate collections. As a proof-of-concept, we analysed 3,628 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from the Active Bacterial Core (ABC) surveillance program, each with MICs measured for six beta-lactam antibiotics. We demonstrate how this toolkit simplifies visualisation of antibiotic resistance data across multiple drugs, resolves common issues such as missing or censored values, and identifies genetic mutations driving correlated resistance changes across multiple antibiotics. We characterise penicillin-binding protein (PBP) substitutions that increase minimum inhibitory concentration to multiple beta-lactam subclasses, revealing subtle differences in their correlated phenotypic effects, and identifying potential constraints on resistance evolution across genetic backgrounds. AMR cartography therefore provides a versatile framework for quantifying and visualising correlated resistance across antibiotics, enhancing the interpretability of complex susceptibility data for both research and public health.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two Arabian, an Eurasian, and an African component, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T that are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss.

Reductionist systems have been instrumental in dissecting IS organization, but conventional systems constrain all ligands to be either mobile or immobile, unlike antigen-presenting cells where intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) is cytoskeletally anchored while T cell receptor (TCR) ligands remain mobile. Here, we establish mixed-mobility supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) that simultaneously present mobile TCR agonists and immobile ICAM1. Selective immobilization of ICAM1 disrupts centripetal F-actin flow, prevents centralization of TCR microclusters and shifts signaling to peripheral microclusters. This attenuates TCR downregulation through ectocytosis while maintaining recycling, and enhances integrin mechanotransduction, reflected in increased phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase, Paxillin and the stretch-sensitive adaptor CasL. Functionally, immobilized ICAM1 augments T cell activation, degranulation, Perforin release and cytotoxicity. Importantly, these findings were recapitulated in a cell-cell system engineered to express either full-length, cytoskeleton-anchored ICAM1 or a truncated form lacking cytoskeletal association, with full-length ICAM1 consistently promoting stronger effector responses.

MAP65-1 preferentially binds bent microtubules both in vitro and in cells, likely because bending induces lattice damage, enhancing nucleation on and bundling of these microtubules in vitro. This creates a potential feedback loop where mechanical stress promotes MAP65-1 binding, which in turn stabilizes microtubules by nucleation and bundling and reinforces the alignment of the array with mechanical stress. Thus, we reveal a previously unknown role for MAP65/PRC1 proteins in lattice-based nucleation and suggest a mechanism by which cells record and respond to mechanical stress through microtubule reorganization.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""545084341;SFB 1027;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101019515;101115795;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

Genomic analysis reveals that the phase variation mechanism is a conserved feature of all HVKp and that additional novel DNA repeats in rmpD and rmpC drive different combinations of capsule mucoidy and hyperexpression phenotypes. These findings establish a mechanistic basis for how HVKp occupy such a diverse array of niches during infection, with important implications for the design and implementation of Kp-specific vaccines and therapies.","[{""name"":""The Anthony Mellow's Charitable Settlement"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Fellowship awarded to J.J.W.;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""320977/Z/24/Z;225315/Z/22/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (ADn) contains a high density of head direction (HD) cells that process sensorimotor inputs for subsequent synaptic integration in postsynaptic cortical areas. We tested the hypothesis that individual HD cells show differences in their firing patterns and connectivity by recording and juxtacellularly labeling single HD cells in subregions of the ADn in awake mice during passive rotation. We identified HD cells that exhibited different response profiles to light, sound, and movement. We also identified a mediolateral gradient of calretinin-expressing (CR+) ADn cells, with CR+ HD cells having narrower tuning widths, lower maximal firing rates, and different intrinsic properties compared to CR-cells. Axons of labeled HD cells could be followed to the retrosplenial cortex, with collaterals innervating the thalamic reticular nucleus (type I cells); others additionally innervated the dorsomedial striatum (type II cells). Most medial CR+ cells preferentially projected to ventral retrohippocampal regions. Surprisingly, we also identified a subpopulation of medial CR+ cells with twisted dendrites and descending axons that avoided the thalamic reticular nucleus, termed tortuosa HD cells (type III cells). We conclude that HD cells of the mouse ADn comprise distinct cell types, providing parallel head-direction-modulated sensorimotor messages to synaptic target neurons within the head direction network.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/R011567/1;MR/Z504518/1;""},{""name"":""The John Fell Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""0013781;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001aqnf71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/Z001358/1;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MH120073;F32MH139270;""},{""name"":""Office of Naval Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rk2pe57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""N00014-1-19-2571;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

This protein complex generates a depolarizing sodium leak in various tissues and contributes to respiratory and circadian rhythms, locomotion, and sleep. De novo and inherited variants of NALCN can lead to severe developmental syndromes called contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD) and infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (IHPRF1), respectively. Although variants of uncertain significance (VUS) or presumed pathogenic variants have been studied in heterologous expression systems before, there is no generally accepted framework on how to assess or predict variant pathogenicity. We set out use the functional and computational characterization of 19 VUS detected in CLIFAHDD and IHPRF1 patients to establish a robust analysis to classify suspected disease-causing variants. Specifically, we employ a combination of multiple parameters derived from two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology recordings and predicted protein stability and conservation scores. We show that this approach is capable of distinguishing benign common variants from both gain- and loss-of-function (GoF/LoF) variants. Additionally, our work provides mechanistic insight into the molecular mechanism underlying specific variants and provides insight into the unusual propensity of NALCN missense variants to result in GoF phenotypes. We anticipate that this experimental and computational framework will aid assessment of variant pathogenicity of NALCN and other components of the channelosome in the future.","[{""name"":""Carlsberg Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01kpjmx04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CF16-0504;""},{""name"":""Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05svhj534"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""7025-00097A;""},{""name"":""Lundbeck Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03hz8wd80"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R252-2017-1671; SAP;R272-2017-4528; AS;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

RetINaBox features an LED array for generating visual stimuli and a photodiode array that acts as a mosaic of model photoreceptors. Custom software on a Raspberry Pi computer reads out responses from model photoreceptors and allows users to control the polarity and delay of the signal transfer from model photoreceptors to model retinal ganglion cells.

We replicated a localized, load-dependent increase in univariate BOLD activity in parietal cortex. However, we also observed both systematic increases and decreases in univariate activity with load across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, multivariate activation patterns encoded WM load regardless of the direction of the univariate effect, arguing against a restricted locus of load signals in parietal cortex.

One important aspect of such networks is experience-dependent plasticity: their activity changes after repeated exposures to external and internal physiological stimuli. This kind of functional plasticity gives rise to habituation to pharmacological interventions (resulting in loss of efficacy over time), sensitization (resulting in unacceptable side effects after repeated use), or canalizing of undesired dynamics that recur even when the original problem has been resolved (persistent disease states). Our in silico analyses reveal that memories formed in gene regulatory networks can be erased by specific further experiences without any changes of network topology (leaving the connectivity in place). We present a method for discovery of stimuli that can be used to selectively delete physiological memories, which can be used to remove unwanted behaviors in biomedical and bioengineering contexts without gene therapy or genomic editing. Remarkably, not only are the training-induced gains in causal emergence not lost after stimuli that wipe memories, but we also find a positive relationship between the causal emergence and learning ability of a network, suggesting a deep asymmetry (ratchet) in the relationship between learning/forgetting and integration of collective intelligence which may have implications for evolution.

Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network. Our RNA-based single-cell gene editing approach enables investigation of cellular responses independent of network effects, providing new insights into neuronal homeostasis and gene function in individual cells in vivo.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

Here we present biochemical, crystallographic and cryo-EM studies of the Sulfolobus Cdv machinery. CdvA, an early non-ESCRT component, adopts a PRC-domain/coiled-coil fold and polymerises into long double-stranded helical filaments, mainly via hydrophobic interfaces. Monomeric CdvB adopts the canonical ESCRT-III fold in both a closed and a distinct ""semi-open"" conformation. Soluble CdvB2 filaments are composed of subunits in the closed state, appearing to transition to the open, active state only when polymerised on membranes. Short N-terminal amphipathic helices in all CdvB paralogues, B, B1 and B2, mediate membrane binding and are required for liposome recruitment in vitro. We provide a molecular overview of archaeal ESCRT-III-based cytokinesis machinery, the definitive demonstration that CdvB proteins are bona fide ESCRT-III homologues and we reveal the molecular basis for membrane engagement.

Here, we applied a meta-analytic mixed model approach to quantify how immune-pathway genes differ from other genes in their rates of protein sequence divergence (dN/dS), evidence for positive selection, and gene turnover rate ({lambda}), while simultaneously accounting for gene length, expression level, genetic and protein-protein interactions, and structural features such as relative solvent accessibility (RSA). In general, rates of sequence evolution were strongly and positively associated with RSA, and negatively with gene length, expression, and genetic/protein-protein interactions, while gene turnover rate was largely unaffected by these factors. We find immune genes evolved significantly faster at the protein sequence level than non-immune genes, but contrary to our expectation exhibited lower gene turnover rates. Functional and pathway-level analyses revealed accelerated evolution in effectors, receptors, and antiviral genes, with cGAS-STING and Toll pathways showing the highest dN/dS. Gene turnover rate was elevated only in effectors, whereas cellular defence genes were particularly conserved. We also found evidence for elevated proportion of sites under episodic positive selection in immune genes, particularly in effectors, indicating ongoing adaptive diversification.

The complexity of these habitats makes the in situ study of community dynamics after coalescence challenging, highlighting the need for controlled experiments to unravel the factors influencing the coalescence in the estuary. To study these processes, we combined natural freshwater and seawater bacterial communities at five different mixing ratios and incubated them in parallel microcosms containing freshwater or seawater incubation media. Forty mixed communities were tracked over six passages using Nanopore full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In the original field samples, freshwater hosted more diverse communities than seawater. While the communities were structurally distinct, shared bacterial families accounted for approximately 95% of total reads. Many low-abundance taxa were lost upon laboratory incubation, while potentially faster-growing ones were enriched. We found that the coalescence outcome was strongly shaped by the incubation media, whereas the mixing ratio had a minor influence. Mixed communities converged toward the source community native to the incubation media, with increasing similarity at a higher source community proportion. In freshwater, a 25% inoculum of the freshwater community was sufficient to re-establish a near-native freshwater community, whereas in seawater, similarity to the native seawater community depended on the inoculation ratio. Network analysis showed a tightly connected module of seawater families, reflecting their shared habitat preference or cooperation, whereas freshwater families were more loosely connected. We also observed that most families were unaffected by mixing ratios or temporal dynamics, with only a few showing mixing ratio dependence. For instance, the freshwater family Comamonadaceae and seawater families Marinomonadaceae and Pseudoalteromonadaceae were dominant in their respective native environments, and increased in mixed communities in proportion to their initial source proportion. Overall, environmental filtering had a stronger impact than the mixing ratio of source communities on coalesced communities, with habitat-specific taxa further modulating the outcome. These findings advanced our understanding of microbial responses to coalescence and provided insights into microbial community assembly in dynamic estuarine systems.

Their acidic internal environment and the presence of an array of hydrolytic enzymes facilitate the efficient breakdown of macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Mitochondria play a critical role in maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis to meet the energy demands under physiological and pathological conditions. Mitochondrial quality control within skeletal muscle during processes such as exercise, disuse, and injury is regulated by mitophagy, where dysfunctional mitochondria are targeted for lysosomal degradation. The limited understanding of quality control mechanisms in skeletal muscle necessitates the need for isolating intact lysosomes to assess organelle integrity and the degradative functions of hydrolytic enzymes. Although several methods exist for lysosome isolation, the complex structure of skeletal muscle makes it challenging to obtain relatively pure and functional lysosomes due to the high abundance of contractile proteins. Here we describe a method to isolate functional lysosomes from small amounts of mouse skeletal muscle tissue, preserving membrane integrity. We also describe functional assays that allow direct evaluation of lysosomal enzymatic activity and we provide data indicating reduced lysosomal degradative activity in lysosomes from aging muscle. We hope that this protocol provides a valuable tool to advance our understanding of lysosomal biology in skeletal muscle, supporting investigations into lysosome-related dysfunction in aging, disease, and exercise adaptations.

New and NoteworthyLysosomes within skeletal muscle function to degrade dysfunctional debris and initiate retrograde signaling pathways. We developed a method to isolate purified lysosomal fractions using a small portion of skeletal muscle, eliminating the need for density gradients or lysosome-modifying agents, ensuring high lysosomal purity without compromising structure or function. By enabling functional analysis via acid phosphatase, cathepsin-B activity, and calcium release, this approach offers a powerful tool to study lysosomal roles in muscle physiology, disease, and exercise.

We present CenSegNet (Centrosome Segmentation Network), a modular deep learning framework for high-resolution, context-aware segmentation of centrosomes and epithelial architecture across diverse tissue types. Integrating a dual-branch architecture with uncertainty-guided refinement, CenSegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalisability across both immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry modalities, outperforming existing models in accuracy and morphological fidelity. Applied to tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 911 breast cancer sample cores from 127 patients, CenSegNet enables the first large-scale, spatially resolved quantification of numerical and structural CA at single-cell resolution. These CA subtypes are mechanistically uncoupled, exhibiting distinct spatial distributions, age-dependent dynamics, and associations with histological tumour grade, hormone receptor status, genomic alterations, and nodal involvement. Discordant CA profiles at tumour margins are linked to local aggressiveness and stromal remodelling, underscoring their clinical relevance. To support broad adoption and reproducibility, CenSegNet is released as an open-source Python library. Together, our findings establish CenSegNet as a scalable, generalisable platform for spatially resolved centrosome phenotyping in intact tissues, enabling systematic dissection of the biology of this organelle and its dysregulation in cancer and other epithelial diseases.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/R026610/1;""},{""name"":""Breast Cancer Now"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qa92s63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""China Scholarship Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04atp4p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758146889225

Here, we visualized the changes in calcium signaling and organelle behavior after activation of the NRC4 (NLR-required for cell death 4) resistosome. We found that NRC4 membrane enrichment coincided with calcium influx. This is followed by sequential mitochondria and plastid disruption, endoplasmic reticulum fragmentation and cytoskeleton depolymerization. Subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear shrinkage, and vacuolar collapse mark the terminal stage of cell death.

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.
