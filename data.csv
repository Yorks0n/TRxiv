This study investigated the neural correlates of reward-based motor learning and focused on two electrophysiological markers: event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the sensorimotor cortex and feedback-related negativity (FRN) from frontal EEG channels. Sixty-four healthy adults performed a visuomotor rotation task with monetary reward or punishment feedback. Learning amount, defined as the degree of error compensation, and retention amount, defined as the maintenance of adapted motor behavior in a no-vision condition, were quantified. Scalp EEG was recorded to assess alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) ERD over the primary motor cortex (M1) during movement preparation and FRN amplitude following feedback presentation. Stepwise regression revealed that FRN amplitude in the late adaptation phase was associated with learning amount, but only among participants with robust event-related potential (ERP) responses (amplitude > {+/-}5 V). This finding suggests that greater neural sensitivity to feedback supports better learning. In contrast, alpha ERD magnitude in the late adaptation phase, along with reinforcement conditions, was a significant predictor of motor skill retention in the full sample, although no interaction effect was observed. These findings suggest that FRN and alpha ERD reflect dissociable neural mechanisms underlying learning and retention, respectively, with FRN indexing feedback sensitivity and alpha ERD reflecting cortical excitability related to memory consolidation. The absence of interaction effects between neural markers and reinforcement conditions further supports the idea that these processes contribute independently to motor adaptation. Practically, combining reward-based training with interventions that increase M1 excitability may enhance retention, while tailoring feedback strategies to maximize FRN responses may improve learning efficiency. These findings provide novel insights into the neural basis of individual variability in motor learning and suggest avenues for personalized approaches in rehabilitation and skill learning.","[{""name"":""JST Moonshot R&D (#JPMJMS2012)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

The Genomic History Inference Strategies Tournament (GHIST) is a community-driven competition designed to evaluate methods for inferring evolutionary history from population genomic data. The inaugural GHIST competition ran from July to November 2024 and featured four demographic history inference challenges of varying complexity: a bottleneck model, a split with isolation model, a secondary contact model with demographic complexity, and an archaic admixture model. Data were provided as error-free VCF files, and participants submitted numerical parameter estimates that were scored by relative root mean squared error. Approximately 60 participants competed, using diverse approaches. Results revealed the current dominance of methods based on site frequency spectra, while highlighting the advantages of flexible model-building approaches for complex demographic histories. We discuss insights regarding the competition and outline the next iteration, which is ongoing with expanded challenge diversity. By providing standardized benchmarks and highlighting areas for improvement, GHIST represents a substantial step toward more reliable inference of evolutionary history from genomic data.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM149235;5T32GM067553;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

This study aims to characterize the contributions of neural circuits to the mechanisms governing resting-state alpha oscillations, which are crucial for various neurocognitive processes and pathologies. Using the Cam-CAN dataset, source-space MEG analyses revealed a pronounced posterior-anterior gradient in alpha frequency, alpha power, and aperiodic components, alongside notable age-related changes. Through neurophysiological modelling, we uncover strong corticothalamic interactions in occipital regions, contrasting with predominantly corticocortical interactions in frontal areas. Ageing is associated with reduced intrathalamic activity and increased corticothalamic delay in occipital regions, while fronto-central regions exhibit increased intrathalamic activity. These findings establish how different circuits shape alpha oscillations across posterior-anterior axis and age, providing a mechanistic foundation for targeted clinical interventions and offering benchmarks for future studies in patient populations.","[{""name"":""Krembil Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037svw098"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Labatt Family Network"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""CAMH Discovery Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

The molecular clock within the club cell of the bronchial epithelium is a key driver of lung rhythmic processes, however, its role in chronic allergic airways disease (AAD) is not known. Elucidating the role of the club cell clock in regulating rhythmic inflammation in AAD could lead to new therapeutic advances. Objectives: To investigate the club cell molecular clock regulation of leukocyte trafficking in chronic AAD. Methods: ccsp-bmal1 KO mice (which lack a functional clock in club cells) and littermate control mice underwent a 5-week chronic house dust mite (HDM) model of AAD, following which leukocyte populations and cytokines from blood, lung and airway compartments were quantified in a 24-hour time-course. Airway epithelial cells were cultured and transepithelial electrical resistance measured to explore circadian variability in barrier permeability and impact of pharmacological modulation of the clock. Main Results: Leukocyte populations accumulate in the blood, lung and airways of HDM exposed mice in a time-of-day dependent manner, with time of peak accumulation dependent on cell type. This temporal gating of leukocyte accumulation is controlled and coordinated by the club cell circadian clock, which also regulates airway barrier integrity. Targeting REVERBa (a component of the molecular circadian clock), was effective at modifying airway barrier permeability achieving reduced transepithelial leukocyte migration. Conclusions: The club cell clock gates leukocyte trafficking signals and airway barrier integrity by time of day in chronic allergic airway inflammation.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MRC-CSF-MR/V0229460/1;""},{""name"":""Asthma UK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""WAPG22/100005;""},{""name"":""Versus Arthritis"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02jkpm469"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22625;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

This limits our ability to infer local neural dynamics reflected in intracranial signals from EEG, a critical step to bridge electrophysiological findings across species and to develop non-invasive brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). We recorded spiking activity from a 32-channel floating microarray permanently implanted in parafoveal V1 and scalp-EEG in a male macaque monkey. While the animal fixated, the screen flickered at different temporal frequencies to induce steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). We analyzed the relationship between the V1 multi-unit spiking activity envelope (MUAe) and EEG frequency bands to predict MUAe at each time point from EEG. We extracted instantaneous spectrotemporal features of the EEG signal, including phase, amplitude, and phase-amplitude coupling of its frequency bands. Although the relationship between these features and the V1 MUAe was complex and frequency-dependent, it was reliably predictive of the MUAe. Specifically, in a multivariate linear regression predicting MUAe from EEG, each EEG feature (phase, amplitude, coupling) contributed to model predictions. In addition, we found that MUAe predictions were better in shallow than deep cortical layers, and that the phase of stimulus frequency further improved MUAe predictions. Our study shows that a comprehensive account of spectrotemporal features of non-invasive EEG can inform about underlying spiking activity, which is beyond what is available when the amplitude or phase of the EEG signal is considered separately. This demonstrates the richness of the EEG signal and its complex relationship with neural spiking activity and suggests that using more comprehensive spectrotemporal signatures could improve BMI applications.","[{""name"":""National Eye Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wkg3b53"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

Platelets, as key regulators of immune responses and tumor progression, may contribute to these sex-based differences by influencing the dynamics of the TME, however, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that GBM patients exhibit heightened platelet reactivity driven by protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) signaling. In murine GBM models, targeting PAR4 with BMS986120 prolongs survival in females but not males. This survival advantage is estrogen-dependent and TME-specific, driven by enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration within the tumor. Inhibiting platelet PAR4 signaling decreases platelet alpha-granule secretion in female tumor-bearing mice while enriching alternative exocytosis pathways, thereby influencing CD8+ T cell activity. PAR4-activated platelets within the TME suppress CD8+ T cell function and CD8+ T cell depletion eliminates the tumor induced platelet reactivity and survival benefit when PAR4 is inhibited. These findings establish platelet-mediated PAR4 signaling as a critical driver of tumor progression and identify sex-specific immune responses as key to therapeutic efficacy.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

Masala features modular architecture in which it is easy for novice developers to add new plugin modules, which can be independently compiled and loaded at runtime, extending functionality of software linking Masala without source code alteration. Here, we describe implementation of Masala modules that accelerate protein and synthetic peptide design. We describe the implementation of Masala real-valued local optimizers and cost function network optimizers that can be used as drop-in replacements for Rosettas minimizer and packer when designing heteropolymers.

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

Upon activation, they oligomerize into inflammasome-like resistosomes to initiate immune signaling, yet the dynamics of resistosome assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the virulence effector AVRcap1b from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans suppresses immune activation by directly engaging oligomerization intermediates of the tomato helper NLR SlNRC3. Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized vulnerability in NLR activation and reveal a pathogen strategy that disrupts immune complex assembly.

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and postnatal brain resulted in rich DNA-RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The two modalities concordance and distinction in spatial patterns highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function.

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6.

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

The persistent infections thought to give rise to these variants, however, have been difficult to identify at scale. This study sought to detect and characterize persistent infection cases in California using routine epidemiologic and genomic surveillance data. We identified 69 persistent infection cases with collection dates between January 2021 and July 2023 ranging from 21 to 400 days in duration, with an average of 44 days. Significant differences were identified in age distribution, sex, hospitalizations, and deaths between persistent infection cases and all sequenced California SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Underlying health conditions were identified for the majority of cases with available medical records. The mutations found in these cases were suggestive of positive selection in the Spike receptor binding domain and convergent evolution toward immune evasion and residues observed in previous persistent infections. We describe a 400-day B.1.429 infection that demonstrates substantial intra-host evolution, and a BA.5.11 persistent infection revealing apparent competition between two intra-host viral subpopulations. By establishing a framework for detecting persistent infections, this study lays the groundwork for other public health organizations to monitor and investigate highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

Author SummaryGenomic surveillance has been used to monitor the evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants throughout the pandemic. When a new variant emerges, it is often due to the accumulation of mutations during a persistent infection, i.e. in an individual who was unable to clear the virus after an infection. Using genomic and epidemiologic surveillance data, we identify 69 of these persistent infections in California and provide demographic and clinical characteristics of these infections compared to the broader population of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of risk factors for persistent infections provides important insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, while the identification of shared mutations between these infections enhances our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution that may result in new variants. Ultimately, our work may help public health labs to better monitor persistent infections in the future, prior to the potential emergence and spread of novel variants into the community.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

How does the brain use such error signals for learning? While global error signals can be useful, their ability to learn complex computation at the scale observed in the brain is lacking. In comparison, more local, neuron-specific error signals enable superior performance, but their computation and propagation remain unclear. Motivated by the breakthrough of deep learning, this has inspired the  backpropagation and the brain hypothesis, i.e. that the brain implements a form of the error backpropagation algorithm.

In this work, we introduce a biologically motivated, multi-area cortical microcircuit model, implementing error backpropagation under consideration of recent physiological evidence. We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation.

We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas. Finally, we make concrete predictions, which differentiate it from other theories, and which can be tested in experiment.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""225643;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03bsmfz84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104

Its impermeable eggshell has restricted the use of small-molecule interventions during embryogenesis. Existing genetic approaches for rendering the embryo permeable to acute small molecule treatment have increased the accessibility of early embryogenesis of pharmacological manipulation but compromise long-term viability for use in studies of later developmental processes or post-exposure physiology. Here, we describe the use of an optimized enzymatic eggshell digestion protocol coupled with a minimal, serum-free culture media that supports the survival and normal development of ex ovo embryos through larval maturation and adulthood. We show that this approach renders embryos permeable to a wide range of small molecules, enabling precise temporal manipulation of developmental processes previously inaccessible through conventional genetic or physical methods. We demonstrate the utility of this technique through the application of small molecule fluorescent dyes, the pharmacological modulation of key cytoskeletal components including microtubules and actin, as well as the minus-end-directed microtubule motor protein dynein, highlighting applications for study of cell division, morphogenesis, and neuronal cell biology, especially in later stages of embryogenesis. This approach expands the experimental toolkit available for labeling and manipulating developmental processes in C. elegans.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM151199;T32GM145388;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754950153104
