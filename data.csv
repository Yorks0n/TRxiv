Although they share a common evolutionary origin with modern-day plants and display complex multicellular development, we still lack comprehensive genome data from the most highly-evolved groups of red algae. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of Bostrychia moritziana, a species that is classified into the Rhodomelaceae family of the Ceramiales order, both of which constitute the largest and most diverse family and order of red algae, respectively. Contrary to the commonly held view that red algae generally have small genomes, we report significant genome size expansion in Bostrychia and other Ceramiales species, which we posit as one of at least three independent genome expansion events that occurred during red algal evolution. Our analyses suggest that these expansions do not involve polyploidy or ancient whole genome duplications, but in the case of Bostrychia appear to be largely driven by the dramatic proliferation of a single lineage of giant Plavaka DNA transposons. Consistent with increased genome size, we identify a substantial increase in gene content in Bostrychia that was shaped both by de novo gene emergence and by the amplification of gene families in common with other Ceramiales seaweeds, providing key insight into the genetic adaptations underpinning the evolutionary success of this species-rich order. Finally, our sex-specific assemblies enabled us to resolve the UV sex chromosomes in Bostrychia, which feature expanded gene-rich sex-linked regions. Notably, these sex-linked regions each harbour a distinct TALE-HD transcription factor orthologous to ancient regulators of haploid-diploid transitions in other multicellular lineages. Together, our findings offer a unique perspective of the genomic adaptations driving red algal diversity and demonstrate how this highly successful group of red seaweeds can provide insight into the evolutionary origins and universal principles of complex multicellular plant life.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

How these clusters interact with genes and their impact on transcriptional activity remain heavily debated. Here we take advantage of the naturally occurring increase in transcriptional activity during Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) in Drosophila melanogaster embryos to characterize the functional roles of RNAPII clusters in a developmental context. Using single-molecule tracking and lattice light-sheet microscopy, we find that RNAPII cluster formation depends on transcription initiation and that cluster lifetimes are reduced upon transcription elongation. We show that single clusters are stably associated with active gene loci during transcription and that cluster intensities are strongly correlated with transcriptional output. Our data suggest that prior to ZGA, RNAPII clusters prime genes for activation, whereas after ZGA, clusters are composed mostly of elongating molecules at individual genes.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

RAD51 mediates initial DSB/template pairing during homology search. A major challenge in understanding homology search in cells is the lack of tools to monitor this process. We developed RAD51 proximity identification sequencing (RaPID-seq), a sensitive method that marks all candidate templates searched by RAD51. We find that HDR is hierarchical, such that DSB proximity determines template candidacy and subsequent recombination is unlocked by DSB/template homology. Sequences that lie outside the proximal window are not efficiently searched, even if identical in sequence. Our data reveal the invisible process of homology search and shed new light on fundamental mechanisms underlying genome editing.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Previous studies have shown that many IC neurons exhibit receptive fields for individual features of auditory stimuli, such as sound frequency, intensity, and location, but growing evidence suggests that some IC neurons may multiplex features of sound. Here, we used in vivo juxtacellular recordings in awake, head-fixed mice to examine how IC neurons responded to frequency-modulated sweeps that varied in speed, direction, intensity, and frequency range. We then applied machine learning methods to determine how individual IC neurons encode features of FM sweeps. We found that individual IC neurons multiplex FM sweep features using various strategies including spike timing, distribution of inter-spike intervals, and first spike latency. In addition, we found that decoding accuracy for sweep direction can vary with sweep speed and frequency range, suggesting the presence of mixed selectivity in single neurons. Accordingly, using static receptive fields for direction alone yielded poor predictions of neuron responses to vocalizations that contain simple frequency changes. Lastly, we showed that encoding strategies varied across individual neurons, resulting in a highly informative population response for FM sweep features. Together, our results suggest that multiplexing sound features is a common mechanism used by IC neurons to represent complex sounds.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Owing to its high throughput and gentle, volumetric imaging nature, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an attractive modality to image such samples. However, the orthogonal dual-objective geometry of LSFM makes sample mounting challenging. Oblique plane microscopy (OPM) circumvents these issues by achieving light-sheet imaging through a single objective near the sample, with a further two objectives acting to image a tilted, oblique plane in the specimen. However, at low magnification, as required for mesoscopic imaging, conventional OPM systems suffer from a complicated and inefficient light path and/or a limited numerical aperture. Here we present a simple method for mesoscopic OPM that enables efficient light collection at any numerical aperture. By placing the camera directly in the remote space, the oblique plane can be imaged without the need for a third microscope system. Using a commercially available camera with 1.4 m pixels, we demonstrate imaging over a 5.3 x 3 x 2.6 mm3 field of view with a lateral resolution of ~2 m and axial resolution of ~22 m. Our technique is then used to image a 4x-expanded brain organoid.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Vaccination in the general population significantly reduces the risk of severe respiratory viral infection and triggers a strong, polyfunctional and lasting T cell response in healthy individuals.

Here we studied the magnitude and functional characteristics of vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the full vaccination protocol, and the recall response after a third booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and compared them to those of people without diabetes. We found defects in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory maintenance and the functionality of the vaccine specific T cells in people with diabetes compared to people without. In those individuals with diabetes that harbored detectable vaccine-specific T cells, they displayed an unfocused, tolerogenic phenotype characterized by increased expression of IL-13 and IL-10 in T1D and T2D compared to people without diabetes. These results have implications for vaccination strategies for people with diabetes.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Here we have identified and characterized a new biological entity enabling this transfer. Unlike other satellites, cf-PICIs produce their own capsids and package their DNA, relying solely on phage tails for transfer. Remarkably, cf-PICIs release non-infective, tail-less capsids containing their DNA into the environment. These subcellular entities then interact with phage tails from various species, forming chimeric particles that inject DNA into different bacterial species depending on the tail present. Additionally, we elucidated the structure of the tail-less cf-PICIs and the mechanism behind their unique capsid formation. Our findings illuminate novel mechanisms used by satellites to spread in nature, contributing to bacterial evolution and the emergence of new pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

The replication and segregation of elements integrated into the host chromosome are ensured by the host life cycle. In contrast, the persistence of autonomously replicating elements relies on their ability to remain within the host population. Here, we assess the evolutionary success of different persistence strategies of prokaryotic plasmids. Through intracellular competitions between plasmid genotypes, we find that combining active partitioning during cell division with a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system for post-segregational killing is more effective than either strategy alone. Mathematical modeling of long-term plasmid evolution, calibrated with empirical plasmid persistence probabilities, further supports these findings. A survey of enterobacterial genomes indicates that partitioning and TA systems are core features of large conjugative plasmids. Indeed, we confirm the presence of a previously unrecognized type I TA system in IncX3 plasmids, which serve as important vectors of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. These findings suggest that large conjugative plasmids likely encode TA systems, including those yet to be identified. The combination of TA and partitioning systems emerges as the most effective strategy for the persistence of low-copy extrachromosomal elements with unstable segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

One such map, the head-direction representation, is believed to be primarily driven by vestibular motion signals in mammals. Here, we combine in vivo imaging of neuronal activity, genetic perturbation of neuronal circuits, behavioral testing, and theoretical modeling to show that the representation of head direction in mouse is driven by not only vestibular but also visual motion signals: both are essential, and the latter, originating in direction-selective retinal ganglion cell activity, dominates at low speeds. We show that, correspondingly, visual perturbations alter navigational behavior that relies on head-direction computation. Finally, we find that head-direction representation and the slow phase of reflexive eye movement are tightly correlated, and we propose a theoretical model that elucidates their emergence from coupled visual and vestibular processes. Our results suggest that the brain's estimate of head direction is built on an oculomotor reflex pathway driven by both visual and vestibular signals.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Using behavioral tracking in a semi-natural environment, neural recordings, and computational models integrating reinforcement and social learning, we show that groups of three isogenic mice spontaneously develop specialized roles while solving a foraging task requiring individual decisions under social constraints. Moreover, these roles are shaped by dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area. Strikingly, despite minor sex-differences in behavior when mice were tested alone, male triads formed stable worker-scrounger relationships driven by competition, whereas female triads adopted uniform, cooperative strategies. Model analysis revealed how intra- and inter-sex parameter differences in resource exploitation, combined with contingent and dynamic social interactions, drive behavioral specialization and labor division. Most notably, it highlighted how contingency, amplified by competition, magnifies individual differences and shapes social profiles. The plastic, adaptive nature of social organization within triads was confirmed by manipulating dopaminergic cell activity, which reshaped social roles and altered group structure. Our findings support a feedback loop where social context shapes neural states, which in turn reinforce behavioral specialization and stabilize social structures.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

However, because non-bilaterian animals lack a through gut, the evolution of anus is still debated. The formation of bilaterian hindgut is governed by the spatial expression of several transcription factors (e.g. Caudal and Brachyury) under the control of Wnt signaling. This conserved pattern has been used to support the homology of the anus of protostomes (insects, snails) and deuterostomes (sea urchins, humans). Here we show, that these bilaterian ''hindgut'' marker genes are expressed around the male gonopore of several xenacoelomorphs, which have a blind gut without an anal opening. These findings suggest a deep evolutionary relationship between the xenacoelomorph male gonopore and the bilaterian anus.

We performed Superb-seq on 10,000 K562 cells, targeting four chromatin remodeler genes with seven guide RNAs. Superb-seq identified 11,891 edit events in 6,230 edited cells at all seven on-target sites and at an additional 36 off-target sites.

A notable off-target edit within the first intron of USP9X disrupted the expression of this gene and over 150 downstream genes. In summary, Cas9 off-targeting is pervasive due to a combination of rare and common edit events, occurs primarily within introns of off-target genes, and can exert widespread effects on gene expression.

While the well-studied zebrafish posterior lateral line has emerged as a powerful model to study collective cell migration, far less is known about development of the anterior lateral line, which produces the supraorbital and infraorbital lines around the eye, as well as mandibular and opercular lines over the jaw and cheek. Here we show that normal development of the zebrafish anterior lateral line system from cranial placodes is dependent on another vertebrate-specific cell type, the cranial neural crest. We find that cranial neural crest and anterior lateral lines develop in close proximity, with absence of neural crest cells leading to major disruptions in the overlying anterior lateral line system. Specifically, in the absence of neural crest neither supraorbital nor infraorbital lateral lines fully extend, such that the most anterior cranial regions remain devoid of neuromasts, while supernumerary ectopic neuromasts form in the posterior supraorbital region. Both neural crest and cranial placodes contribute neurons to the lateral line ganglia that innervate the neuromasts and in the absence of neural crest these ganglia, as well as the lateral line afferent nerves, are disrupted. Finally, we establish that as ontogeny proceeds, the most anterior supraorbital neuromasts come to lie within neural crest-derived frontal and nasal bones in the developing cranium. These are the same anterior supraorbital neuromasts that are absent or mislocated in specimens lacking neural crest cells. Together, our results establish that cranial neural crest and cranial placode derivatives function in concert over the course of ontogeny to build the complex cranial lateral line system.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Currently, little is known about the internal signals regulating haustorium development. Here, we identify root meristem growth factor (RGF) peptides in Phtheirospermum japonicum as endogenous inducers of prehaustorium formation. Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression of PjYUC3, a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through tandem multiplication and neofunctionalization. Our findings establish RGF peptides and their corresponding receptors as critical components of haustorium developmental signaling and provide insights into the evolutionary trajectories that shape plant parasitism.

Yet, how cells interrogate and respond to mechanical cues remains incompletely understood. Reproducing the mechanical properties of natural tissues in vitro is a key challenge, as these tissues exhibit complex viscoelastic behaviors and undergo continuous remodeling throughout an organism's development. Here, we leverage principles of dynamic DNA nanotechnology to introduce programmable mechanical cues into a synthetic hydrogel matrix that guides and interrogates the development of embedded cells. By systematically modulating matrix stress relaxation and stiffness, we uncover two distinct timescales of mechano-sensitive processes controlling apical-basal polarity in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells: the fast timescale (1-3 min) is linked to rapid integrin-mediated signaling, while the slower process (3-9 h) is associated with cytoskeletal reinforcements. Our analysis highlights that the commonly reported matrix 'stiffness' value, often measured as the storage modulus at ~1 Hz, has limited physiological relevance. These findings prompted us to develop a novel switchable DNA crosslinker that enables dynamic changes in viscoelasticity during ongoing cell culture. This controlled matrix reconfiguration induces reversible cell polarity inversions and guides the morphogenesis of complex multicellular structures. The material platform therefore offers unprecedented control over the mechanical microenvironment, opening new avenues for advanced applications in biophysics, tissue engineering, and disease modeling.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1739398079291

Hebbian coincidence detection requires that NMDARs be located postsynaptically, but enigmatic presynaptic NMDARs (preNMDARs) also exist. It is known that preNMDARs regulate neurotransmitter release, but precisely how remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggest that NMDARs can also signal non-ionotropically, without the need for Ca2+ flux. At synapses between developing visual cortex layer-5 (L5) pyramidal cells (PCs), preNMDARs rely on Mg2+ and Rab3-interacting molecule 1{beta} (RIM1{beta}) to regulate evoked release during periods of high-frequency firing, but they signal non-ionotropically via c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) to regulate spontaneous release regardless of frequency. At the same synapses, timing- dependent long-term depression (tLTD) depends on preNMDARs but not on frequency. We therefore tested if tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling. We found that tLTD at L5 PC[-&gt;]PC synapses was abolished by pre- but not postsynaptic NMDAR deletion, cementing the view that tLTD requires preNMDARs. In agreement with non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling, tLTD prevailed after channel pore blockade with MK-801, unlike tLTP. Homozygous RIM1{beta} deletion did not affect tLTD, but wash-in of the JNK2 blocker SP600125 abolished tLTD. Consistent with a presynaptic need for JNK2, a peptide blocking the interaction between JNK2 and Syntaxin-1a (STX1a) abolished tLTD if loaded pre- but not postsynaptically, regardless of frequency. Finally, low-frequency tLTD was not blocked by the channel pore blocker MK-801, nor by 7-CK, a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist at the co-agonist site. We conclude that neocortical L5 PC[-&gt;]PC tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling via JNK2/STX1a. Our study brings closure to long-standing controversy surrounding preNMDARs and highlights how the textbook view of NMDARs as ionotropic coincidence detectors in plasticity needs to be reassessed.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

However, these models come with inherent challenges due to line-to-line and clonal variability. To combat this issue, the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI) has generated an iPSC repository using a single clonal reference line, KOLF2.1J, into which disease-causing mutations and revertants are introduced via gene editing. Here we describe the generation and validation of lines carrying the most common causative mutation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, for the iNDI collection of neurodegenerative iPSC models. We demonstrate that these C9orf72 knock-in lines differentiate efficiently into neurons and display characteristic C9orf72-associated pathologies, including reduced C9orf72 levels and the presence of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) and RNA foci, which increase in abundance over time in culture. These pathologies are not present in revertant cells lacking the repeat expansion. These repeat expansion and revertant cell lines are now available to academic and for-profit institutions through the JAX iPS cell repository and will help to facilitate and standardise iPSC-based ALS/FTD research.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

However, few clinical trials have tested their value prospectively. The DUTRENEO trial (EudraCT: 2017-002246-6) investigated whether an 18-gene Tumour Inflammation Signature (TIS) that can robustly identify patients who respond to ICI in multiple tumour types could stratify patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) to receive neoadjuvant ICI (durvalumab+tremelimumab) or standard cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Patients with TIS-high tumors were randomized to ICI or NAC, while patients with TIS-low tumors received NAC. A total of 73 patients were treated. Pathological complete response (pCR) rates were 38.5% (TIS-High, ICI), 30% (TIS-High, NAC), and 55% (TIS-Low, NAC) (p = 0.349), indicating that - as applied - the TIS score did not significantly enrich in responders to ICI. Post-hoc analysis showed that higher TIS thresholds improved prediction of response to ICI but excluded many responders. Multi-omics analyses of pre-treatment samples, including whole-exome sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics (Visium, Xenium), revealed that bulk RNA response signatures originated mainly from cancer cells. Spatial transcriptomics showed that ICI response was associated with proximity between cancer cells and adaptive immune cells, while resistance to NAC was linked to phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells despite low genetic diversity. The unique design of the DUTRENEO trial underscores the challenges of translating retrospective biomarkers into clinical practice and highlights the importance of spatial features in understanding tumour-immune interactions. These findings suggest that integrating spatial and multi-modal biomarkers in well-designed clinical trials could improve stratification and response prediction to select neoadjuvant therapy.","NA","medrxiv",1739398079291

The resulting mutations conveyed significant improvements in catalytic activity, particularly kcat and total turnover number. The redox potential and structure-function relationships were examined to elucidate the source of this improved functionality.

While many network models have been proposed to describe connectome communication, current approaches assume that every pair of neural elements communicates according to the same principle. Connectomes, however, are heterogeneous networks, comprising elements with varied topological and neurobiological makeups. In this paper, we investigate how connectome architecture may facilitate different signalling regimes depending on the topological embedding of communicating neural elements. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the modular structure of brain networks fosters a dual mode of communication balancing diffusion-passive signal broadcasting - and routing - selective transmission via efficient paths. To this end, we introduce the relative diffusion score (RDS), a measure to quantify the proportional capacity for network communication via diffusion versus routing. We examined the interplay between RDS and connectome architecture in 6 organisms spanning a wide range of spatial resolutions and connectivity mapping techniques - from the complete nervous system of the larval fly to the inter-areal human connectome. Our analyses establish multiple lines of evidence suggesting that connectomes may be universally organised to support within-module diffusion and between-module routing. Using a series of rewiring null models, we untangle the contributions of connectome topology and geometry to the relationship between routing, diffusion and modular architecture. In conclusion, our work puts forth a hybrid conceptualisation of neural communication, in which diffusion contributes to functional segregation by concentrating information within localised clusters, while specialised signal routes enable fast, long-range and cross-system functional integration.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

RAD51 showed two-tiered accumulation around DSBs, with a broad (~Mb) domain arising from the homology search. This domain is regulated by cohesin unloader, is constrained by TAD boundaries, and it overlaps with chromatin regions reeled through the break-anchored loop, suggesting that loop extrusion regulates the homology search. Indeed, depletion of NIPBL results in reduced HR, and this effect is more pronounced when the HR donor is far (~100 kb) from the break.

We show that polysynaptic communication through the structural connectome is correlated with treatment response in two independent cohorts of patients treated with TMS to the left DLPFC (r = -0.56, p = 0.0018; r = -0.52, p = 0.0047), and that DLPFC sites of stronger negative functional connectivity to the SGC are connected to it via shorter fibre pathways. Our results shed light onto the neuroanatomical basis of TMS therapy for depression and pave the way for brain stimulation protocols based on polysynaptic communication via the connectome.","NA","medrxiv",1739398079291

The results show that morphological variations are more pronounced within individual populations especially in the principal component one, relating to the facial width, degree of prognathism, and location of occipital areas, in contrast to the relatively smaller variations observed between different phases and geographical regions.

Materials and methodsThis retrospective study utilized electronic health record data from OneFlorida+ (2015-2024). Adults eligible for AOMs were included, defined as having a BMI [&ge;]30 kg/m{superscript 2} or a BMI of 27-29.9 kg/m{superscript 2} with at least one obesity-related comorbidity. The primary outcome was the initiation of newer AOMs, specifically glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) including liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. Trends across years were examined, and a multivariable logistic regression identified sociodemographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors associated with AOM initiation.

ResultsOf 319,949 adults, 1.8% initiated newer AOMs. Semaglutide accounted for 77.9% of initiations, tirzepatide 19.7%, and liraglutide 17.8%. Initiation trends showed liraglutide uptake peaked at 5% in 2018 but declined afterward, while semaglutide and tirzepatide uptake increased exponentially since 2022. Odds of initiation were lower for Black (aOR (95% CI): 0.87 [0.80- 0.94]) and Hispanic (0.84 [0.78-0.91]) groups vs. Whites, and for Medicaid (0.69 [0.63-0.76]) and uninsured (0.81 [0.74-0.87]) patients vs. privately insured. Higher odds were associated with being female, middle-aged, having more outpatient visits, and visiting endocrinologists.

ConclusionsThe initiation of newer AOMs among overweight and obese populations remains low, but uptake has increased exponentially since 2022. Our findings reveal significant disparities in obesity care, highlighting the importance of addressing inequities in AOM access to improve obesity outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1739398079291

Despite the progress in sequencing and CRISPR technologies, proteome-wide mutation effect prediction remains challenging. Here, we introduce ProteoCast, a scalable and interpretable computational method for proteome-wide classification of genetic variants and functional protein site identification. It relies solely on evolutionary information, leveraging protein sequence data across organisms. Results: Using ProteoCast, we generated mutational landscapes for 22,169 Drosophila melanogaster proteoforms, categorising over 293 million amino acid substitutions as functionally neutral, uncertain, or impactful. We validated our predictions with over 380 thousand natural polymorphisms observed in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and Drosophila Evolution over Space and Time (DEST) datasets and with FlyBase's developmentally lethal mutations. About 86% of known lethal mutations were classified as impactful or uncertain, versus only 13% and 18% of DGRP and DEST mutations. Moreover, we performed ProteoCast-guided genome editing experiments, providing a proof-of-concept of the validity of this strategy. Beyond variant effect prediction, ProteoCast detected evolutionary conservation signals in about one-third of 40.5K annotated post-translational modification sites and 83% of ~90 known short linear motifs. These results support its usefulness for uncovering interaction and regulatory sites in unstructured protein regions. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate ProteoCast applicability for model organisms, contributing to basic genetic research and translational studies. This work provides a publicly available dataset, user-friendly interactive web services, and a locally deployable pipeline tool for further research into gene function and mutation effects in any organism.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Human-associated pathogens can be part of the microbiome and are likely to be transported during these missions. This study examines the immunological responses of human immune cells stimulated with non-fastidious bacterial species that cause opportunistic infections, i.e. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, after exposure to simulated Martian conditions, including UV radiation, desiccation and atmospheric pressure. We observed that exposure of the bacteria to these conditions altered cytokine secretion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and phagocytic activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Specifically, exposure to desiccation reduced cytokines and ROS production, indicating impaired innate immune recognition and stimulation. Notably, the altered immune response was partially restored when desiccated bacteria were regrown in standard media. Flow cytometry revealed decreased bacterial size and complexity of both species post-exposure. These findings indicate that Martian conditions induce bacterial morphological and physiological changes, which could impair immune recognition and response. Expanding these studies to in vivo models and a broader range of potentially pathogenic microorganisms is essential to estimate infection risks during Mars missions, which is vital for developing strategies to mitigate infection risks and maintain astronaut health during long-term space travel.

ImportanceSince Yuri Gagarins 1961 flight, human space exploration has expanded, unintentionally transporting microorganisms, including pathogens, into space environments. Our previous studies demonstrated that opportunistic pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens can survive simulated Mars conditions. With upcoming Mars missions, it is crucial to understand how such conditions influence these pathogens and their interaction with the human immune system. This research evaluates immune responses to bacteria pathogens exposed to Martian stressors such as UV radiation and desiccation, revealing significant changes of the immune responses to the exposed bacteria. These findings provide essential insights into the health risks that astronauts may face if infected with Mars-adapted pathogens. Understanding these interactions will help to develop preventive strategies and therapeutic measures, ensuring the safety and health of crew members during long-term missions. Ultimately, this work contributes to the broader objective of safe human exploration and colonization of Mars.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Under nutrient starvation, Bt cells differentiate into spores and associated toxin crystals that can adopt biofilm-like aggregates. We reveal that such Bt spore/toxin biofilms are embedded in a fibrous extrasporal matrix (ESM), and using cryoID, we resolved the structure and molecular identity of an uncharacterized type of pili, referred to here as Fibrillar ENdospore Appendages or ""F-ENA"". F-ENA are monomolecular protein polymers tethered to the exosporium of Bt and are decorated with a flexible tip fibrillum. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that F-ENA is widespread not only in the class Bacilli, but also in the class Clostridia, and the cryoEM structures of F-ENA filaments from Bacillus, Anaerovorax and Paenibaccilus reveal subunits with a generic head-neck domain structure, where the {beta}-barrel neck of variable length latch onto a preceding head domain through short N-terminal hook peptides. In Bacillus, two collagen-like proteins (CLP) respectively tether F-ENA to the exosporium (F-Anchor), or constitute the tip fibrillum at the distal terminus of F-ENA (F-BclA).

MRSA strains are resistant to front-line beta-lactams due to PBP2a, a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein encoded by mecA. Daptomycin is used to treat MRSA infections but is not always effective and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Understanding why daptomycin fails is crucial to devising strategies to improve treatment outcomes. Here, using a panel of clinical bacteraemia isolates, we show that MRSA strains are less susceptible to daptomycin than methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains. This difference in susceptibility was due to mecA and was independent of any changes in surface properties previously associated with altered daptomycin susceptibility. Instead, using a mecA transposon mutant, we found that a lack of this gene led to higher activity of the Agr quorum sensing system, resulting in an increased release of the phenol-soluble modulin toxins. Increased levels of these surfactant-like toxins prevented daptomycin from being inactivated by lipids released by the bacteria, leading to enhanced susceptibility to the antibiotic. Additionally, the clinical MRSA strains tested produced lower levels of toxins than the MSSA strains and inactivated daptomycin to a greater extent, explaining their reduced susceptibility. Expression of mecA in clinical MSSA strains reduced toxin production, increasing daptomycin inactivation and thereby enhancing survival. Together, these results demonstrate that mecA does not only affect beta-lactam susceptibility but also compromises the efficacy of the last resort antibiotic daptomycin.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

This work demonstrates the design of a specific array of histidine residues on the internal surface of the ferritin cage to function as an active center for catalysis. The crystal structures of the ferritin mutants revealed histidine-histidine interactions, forming well-defined histidine clusters (His-clusters). These mutants exhibit peroxidase-mimetic activities by oxidizing 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Molecular dynamics simulations further highlight the co-localization of TMB and hydrogen peroxide at the histidine-rich clusters, indicating that the confined environment of the ferritin cage enhances their interactions. This study presents a simple yet effective approach to design cofactor-free artificial enzymes, paving the way for innovations in bioinspired catalysis.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Seagrasses, as globally distributed marine flowering plants, have critical ecological functions, but knowledge about their associated fungal communities remains relatively limited. Previous amplicon surveys of the fungal community associated with the seagrass, Zostera marina have revealed an abundance of potentially novel chytrids. In this study, we employed deep metagenomic sequencing to extract metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from these chytrids and other microbial eukaryotes associated with Z. marina leaves. Our efforts resulted in the recovery of five eukaryotic MAGs, including a single fungal MAG in the order Loubulomycetales (65% BUSCO completeness), three MAGs representing diatoms in the family Bacillariaceae (93%, 70% and 31% BUSCO completeness) and a single MAG representing a haptophyte algae in the genus Prymnesium (40% BUSCO completeness). Whole-genome phylogenomic assessment of these MAGs suggests they all largely represent under sequenced, and possibly novel eukaryotic lineages. Of particular interest, the chytrid MAG was placed within the order Lobulomycetales, consistent with the identity of the dominant chytrid from previous Z. marina amplicon survey results. Annotation of this MAG yielded 5,650 gene models of which 77% shared homology to current databases. With-in these gene models, we predicted 121 carbohydrate-active enzymes and 393 secreted proteins (103 cytoplasmic effectors, 30 apoplastic effectors). Exploration of orthologs between the Lobulomycetales MAG and existing Chytridiomycota genomes have revealed a landscape of high-copy gene families related to host recognition and interaction. Further machine learning analyses based on carbohydrate-active enzyme composition predict that this MAG is a symbiont. Overall, these five eukaryotic MAGs represent substantial genomic novelty and valuable community resources, contributing to a deeper understanding of the roles of fungi and other microbial eukaryotes in the larger seagrass ecosystem.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

We have previously shown that deletion of endothelial cell (EC) Panx1 reduces ischemic stroke infarct volume and reduces cerebral arterial myogenic reactivity, which regulates cerebral blood flow. We hypothesized that EC Panx1 content dictates ischemic stroke outcome and thus increased EC Panx1 expression will worsen ischemic stroke outcomes due to exacerbated myogenic tone development and impaired cerebral blood flow recovery. To test this, we generated the Cdh5-CreERT2+ ROSA26-hPanx1Tg mouse model that conditionally overexpresses the human isoform of Panx1 specifically in EC. We have found that cerebral myogenic reactivity is significantly increased with overexpression of EC Panx1 only in female mice, without alterations in peripheral vascular reactivity or blood pressure regulation. Similarly, we found that infarct size was increased and recovery of cerebral blood flow was reduced in female but not male EC Panx1 overexpressing mice. Our findings indicate a role for EC Panx1 as a mediator of ischemic stroke recovery. Furthermore, these data suggest a potential sex-dependent effect for EC Panx1, where females are more sensitive to increased EC Panx1 in cerebral vascular function and may provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic stroke in women.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

While T6SS gene clusters are found in all recently isolated commensals or pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, they are absent from classical laboratory strains. These E. coli strains, which have been used since decades for bacterial genetics, were usually grown in pure cultures, suggesting that T6SS might have been lost during evolution in absence of competitors. Here, we conducted a 640-generation experimental evolution by passaging the enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) 17-2 strain under controlled competition conditions against susceptible or immune recipient cells. EAEC T6SS activity was almost abolished when grown in the presence of immune recipients, while no difference with the ancestral strain was observed for EAEC grown in the presence of susceptible cells. Whole genome sequencing of 18 clones identified adaptative mutations responsible for the loss of T6SS activity, including mutations of the T6SS promoter and within genes encoding T6SS subunits, and revealed a novel regulatory mechanism involving RfaH-dependent antitermination. We further found that the RfaH binding site ops element is present in T6SS gene clusters of several species, suggesting a conserved RfaH-dependent regulation of T6SSs across enterobacteria. This work exemplifies the power of experimental evolution to understand T6SS genetic adaptation and to unravel new players for its function.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Here, we demonstrate that short 5' untranslated regions (UTRs), a characteristic of many viral mRNAs, can also serve as a molecular pattern for innate immune recognition via the interferon-induced proteins IFIT2 and IFIT3. The IFIT2-IFIT3 heterodimer, formed through an intricate domain swap structure resolved by cryo-EM, mediates viral mRNA 5' end recognition, translation inhibition, and ultimately antiviral activity. Critically, 5' UTR lengths <50 nucleotides are necessary and sufficient to sensitize an mRNA to translation inhibition by the IFIT2-IFIT3 complex. Accordingly, diverse viruses whose mRNAs contain short 5' UTRs, such as vesicular stomatitis virus and parainfluenza virus 3, are sensitive to IFIT2-IFIT3-mediated antiviral activity. Our work thus reveals a pattern of antiviral nucleic acid immune recognition that takes advantage of the inherent constraints on viral genome size.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

In addition to releasing interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18, GSDMD pores cause a lytic, proinflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. Blocking this pathway holds therapeutic promise for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, but clinical trials of cell permeable caspase inhibitors have been unsuccessful. Here, we describe covalent inhibitors of proinflammatory caspases that are impermeable to healthy cells but effectively block caspase-1 driven pyroptosis and IL-1{beta} secretion. Their failure to inhibit apoptosis implies inhibitor entry through GSDMD pores. Propidium iodide entered rescued cells, confirming transient membrane permeabilization via caspase-1 and GSDMD. Caspase-1 inhibition prevented rather than delayed cell death, likely due to the activation of membrane repair mechanisms neutralizing the initial GSDMD pores. Notably, inhibiting caspase-1 and -11 suppressed IL-1{beta} and IL-18 production in a mouse model of endotoxic shock. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of exploiting GSDMD pores for the delivery of caspase inhibitors, offering a novel strategy for treating inflammatory diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Despite numerous clinical observations and causality investigations, understanding of the diseases progression and recovery process following infection remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the causal connections between COVID-19 and various diseases using Mendelian randomization studies to provide robust theoretical underpinnings for the development of effective rehabilitation and intervention strategies.

MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies on Mendelian randomization related to COVID-19 published up to October 21, 2024. We used an extensive search strategy with the keywords ""Mendelian randomization"" and ""COVID-19"". Two pairs of coauthors independently extracted data on study characteristics, exposure, and outcomes, resolving discrepancies through discussion. We included studies that considered susceptibility to COVID-19, hospitalization, or severe infection as the exposure and disease-related effects or impacts on human health as outcomes. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the MR-STROBE criteria and extracted the relative risk (odds ratio [OR]) using a random-effects model for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42025615426.

ResultsOf the 1654 studies identified, 87 met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. The primary outcome suggests that COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of cardio-cerebral vascular diseases. Subgroup analyses identified an increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, including optic nerve disorders, epilepsy, schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder, stroke, myocardial infarction with COVID-19. There is also a notable association between COVID-19 and the immune system, particularly neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and myasthenia gravis.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that COVID-19 infection has direct causal effects on human health or certain diseases at the genetic level, which may manifest as increased or decreased susceptibility to disease and changes in disease severity.","NA","medrxiv",1739398079291

Yet, its precise role in shaping human-wildlife pathogen exchanges remains unclear. Analysing 40 years of global wildlife trade data, we show that traded mammals are twice as likely to share pathogens with humans than non-traded species. Moreover, time spent in trade strongly predicts the number of zoonotic pathogens that wildlife species host: on average, a species shares an additional pathogen with humans for every 9 years of presence in trade. This work highlights the importance of the wildlife trade in driving animal-to-human pathogen transmission, offering key insights into pathogen biogeography in the Anthropocene and the prevention of future pandemics.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

For beneficial mutations, the outcome of this process may be a selective sweep, in which an allele rapidly increases in frequency and perhaps reaches fixation within a population. Selective sweeps have well-studied effects on patterns of local genetic variation in panmictic populations, but much less is known about the dynamics of sweeps in continuous space. In particular, because limited movement across a landscape leads to unique patterns of population structure, spatial dynamics may influence the trajectory of selected mutations. Here, we use forward-in-time, individual-based simulations in continuous space to study the impact of space on beneficial mutations as they sweep through a population. In particular, we show that selection changes the joint distribution of allele frequency and geographic range occupied by a focal allele and demonstrate that this signal can be used to identify selective sweeps. We then leverage this signal to identify in-progress selective sweeps within the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, a species under strong selection pressure from vector control measures. By considering space, we identify multiple previously undescribed variants with potential phenotypic consequences, including mutations im-pacting known IR-associated genes and altering protein structure and properties. Our results demonstrate a novel signal for detecting selection in spatial population genetic data that may have implications for genomic surveillance and understanding geographic patterns of genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

Vision initiates with a light-triggered phototransduction cascade occurring in photoreceptor cells (PRCs). The two main PRC types, ciliary and rhabdomeric, employ both specific and common genes for phototransduction. Despite being crucial for vision, the origin and evolution of photoreceptor cells and phototransduction pathways remain unclear. Using phylogenetic methods, we studied the evolution of all phototransduction genes, elucidating their gene duplication patterns in over 80 species, including non-bilaterian metazoans and other eukaryotes. Then, we investigated the expression of phototransduction genes in available single-cell RNA-sequencing data from various animals, including non-bilaterians. By using phototransduction genes as markers, we identified putative photoreceptor-like cells across animals and compared their regulatory toolkits. Gene families encoding phototransduction components are generally ancient, predating the origin of vision. However, many phototransduction genes originated in the metazoan stem group. Moreover, putative photoreceptor cells identified in non-bilaterians appeared to express some but not all components of the two well-characterised phototransduction pathways, suggesting potential lineage-specific components involved in phototransduction. Finally, we identified conserved expression of certain transcription factors in putative PRCs in non-bilaterians, suggesting the homology of PRCs.","NA","biorxiv",1739398079291

However, PRS model training presents significant challenges for broader adoption of PRS, including limited access to computational resources, difficulties in implementing advanced PRS methods, and availability and privacy concerns over individual-level genetic data. Cloud computing provides a promising solution with centralized computing and data resources. Here we introduce PennPRS (https://pennprs.org), a scalable cloud computing platform for online PRS model training in precision medicine. We developed novel pseudo-training algorithms for multiple PRS methods and ensemble approaches, enabling model training without requiring individual-level data. These methods were rigorously validated through extensive simulations and large-scale real data analyses involving over 6,000 phenotypes across various data sources. PennPRS supports online single- and multi-ancestry PRS training with seven methods, allowing users to upload their own data or query from more than 27,000 datasets in the GWAS Catalog, submit jobs, and download trained PRS models. Additionally, we applied our pseudo-training pipeline to train PRS models for over 8,000 phenotypes and made their PRS weights publicly accessible. In summary, PennPRS provides a novel cloud computing solution to improve the accessibility of PRS applications and reduce disparities in computational resources for the global PRS research community.","NA","medrxiv",1739398079291
