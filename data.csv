These complexes work in concert to transfer electrons and pump protons, leading to ATP regeneration. The precise organization of these complexes in native cells is debated, notably their assembly into higher-order supercomplexes called respirasomes. Here, we use in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes inside Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes are segregated into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively. Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a single type of respirasome, from which we determined a native 5 [A]-resolution structure showing the binding of electron carrier cytochrome c. Combined with single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction at 2.4 [A] resolution, we assemble a detailed model of how the respiratory complexes interact with each other inside native mitochondria.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

The primary endpoint examines the responder rate and mean change in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) after approximately 12 weeks of treatment in eligible patients with moderate or worse tinnitus. A responder represents a THI improvement of greater than seven points (i.e., minimal clinically important difference, MCID). Of 212 patients with available data, there was a high responder rate of 91.5% (95% CI: 86.9%, 94.5%) with a mean improvement of 27.8 {+/-} 1.3 (SEM) points, and no device-related serious adverse events. Furthermore, a THI MCID of seven points represents a consistent criterion for clinical benefit based on real-world evidence.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789

KP.3, featuring F456L and Q493E, exhibits a markedly enhanced ACE2 binding affinity compared to KP.2 and the JN.1 variant due to synergistic effects between these mutations. This study elucidated the structures of KP.2 and KP.3 RBD in complex with ACE2 using cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and decipher the structural and thermodynamic implications of these mutations on receptor binding by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealing that F456L mutation facilitates a more favorable binding environment for Q493E, leading to stronger receptor interactions which consequently enhance the potential for incorporating additional evasive mutations. These results underscore the importance of understanding mutational epistatic interactions in predicting SARS-CoV-2 evolution and optimizing vaccine updates. Continued monitoring of such epistatic effects is crucial for anticipating new dominant strains and preparing appropriate public health responses.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start-point for evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling, and limited phylogenetic signal. Here, we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution based on a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins which includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our comprehensive analyses with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models reveal that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages: ""Opimoda+"" and ""Diphoda+"". Compellingly, this position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing ""typical excavates"" are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the ""excavate"" cell architecture trace back to LECA. This study is the most comprehensive phylogenetic investigation of the eukaryote root to date, shedding light on the ancestral cells from which extant eukaryotes arose and providing a crucial framework for investigating the origin and evolution of canonical eukaryotic features.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Evolutionary transitions between sex-chromosome systems--which change the chromosome pair that determines sex, the system of heterogamety, or both--are frequent in some clades. In others, however, sex chromosome systems show long-term stability. Previous explanations of this stasis rely on evolutionary dynamics peculiar to sex linkage, such as the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the sex-specific chromosome or sexually antagonistic mutations on either sex chromosome. Here, I show that the ordinary operation of stabilizing selection on quantitative traits can, as a by-product, promote stability of sex chromosome systems. The reason is that stabilizing selection on a trait permits individual chromosomes' genetic contributions to the trait to drift upwards or downwards, subject only to the constraint that they all sum to the trait optimum. This chromosome-specific drift causes reduced fitness in individuals with unusual chromosomal constitutions, such as the novel sexual genotypes that sex chromosome turnovers always produce. The theory can explain a suite of patterns in the phylogenetic distribution of sex determining systems. Applied to interspecific hybrids, it can also explain two key observations concerning their reduced fitness: Haldane's rule and the large-X effect.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

However, their influence on cognitive performance across early life remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the contribution of common genome-wide and rare exonic variation to cognitive performance across childhood and adolescence primarily using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n=6,495 unrelated children). We show that the effect of common variants associated with educational attainment and cognitive performance increases as children age. Conversely, the negative effect of deleterious rare variants attenuates with age. Using trio analyses, we show that these age-related trends are driven by direct genetic effects on the individual who carries these variants. We further find that the increasing effects of common variants are stronger in individuals at the upper end of the phenotype distribution, whereas the attenuating effects of rare variants are stronger in those at the lower end. Concordant results were observed in the Millenium Cohort Study (5,920 children) and UK Biobank (101,232 adults). The effects of common and rare genetic variation on childhood cognitive performance are broadly comparable in magnitude to those of other factors such as parental educational attainment, maternal illness and preterm birth. The effects of maternal illness and preterm birth on childhood cognitive performance also attenuate with age, whereas the effect of parental educational attainment does not. Furthermore, we show that the relative contribution of these various factors differ depending on whether one considers their contribution to phenotypic variance across the entire population or to the risk of poor outcomes. Our findings may help explain the apparent incomplete penetrance of rare damaging variants associated with neurodevelopmental conditions. More generally, they also show the importance of studying dynamic genetic influences across the life course and their differential effects across the phenotype distribution.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789

In this study, we report on the neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape, infectivity, fusion, and stability of these subvariants-LB.1, KP.2.3, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1. Our findings demonstrate that all of these subvariants are highly evasive of nAbs elicited by the bivalent mRNA vaccine, the XBB.1.5 monovalent mumps virus-based vaccine, or from infections during the BA.2.86/JN.1 wave. This reduction in nAb titers is primarily driven by a single serine deletion (DelS31) in the NTD of the spike, leading to a distinct antigenic profile compared to the parental JN.1 and other variants. We also found that the DelS31 mutation decreases pseudovirus infectivity in CaLu-3 cells, which correlates with impaired cell-cell fusion. Additionally, the spike protein of DelS31 variants appears more conformationally stable, as indicated by reduced S1 shedding both with and without stimulation by soluble ACE2, and increased resistance to elevated temperatures. Molecular modeling suggests that the DelS31 mutation induces a conformational change that stabilizes the NTD and strengthens the NTD-Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) interaction, thus favoring the down conformation of RBD and reducing accessibility to both the ACE2 receptor and certain nAbs. Additionally, the DelS31 mutation introduces an N-linked glycan modification at N30, which shields the underlying NTD region from antibody recognition. Our data highlight the critical role of NTD mutations in the spike protein for nAb evasion, stability, and viral infectivity, and suggest consideration of updating COVID-19 vaccines with antigens containing DelS31.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

We find that cells in the embryo undergo rapid and spatially varying changes in their mechanical properties and that these differ in cell populations with different fates and behaviours. We identify microtubules as potential effectors of cell mechanics in this system, and corroborate our experimental findings with a physical model that underscores the role of localised and dynamic changes in mechanical properties to facilitate tissue folding.

Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

It also provides a unique habitat for ecological microbiota. Previous research on the microbiome of pollen has largely focussed on angiosperm systems, with limited research into coniferous gymnosperms. This study characterises the pollen microbiome associated with one of the worlds most widely grown tree species, Pinus radiata. Trees were sampled from locations across Canterbury, New Zealand, with repeated collections in 2020 and 2021. Metabolomic analysis revealed the main compounds present on P. radiata pollen to be amino acids (principally proline), and carbohydrates (fructose, glucose, and sucrose). Although phenolic compounds such as {rho}-coumaric acid and catechin, and terpenoids such as dehydroabietic acid, were present at low concentrations, their strong bioactive natures mean they may be important in filtering of microbiome communities on pollen. Pinus radiata pollen was found to host a microbiome dominated by fungi; this directly contrasts with those for many angiosperm species. Geographic range and sampling years were evaluated as secondary drivers of microbiome assembly. Neither sampling location nor annual variation had a significant impact on the fungal component of the pine pollen microbiome, which was remarkably stable/conserved among samples. However, some bacterial taxa exhibited sensitivity to geographic distances and yearly variations, suggesting a secondary role for some. A core microbiome was identified in P. radiata pollen, characterized by a consistent presence of specific fungal and bacterial taxa across samples. While the dominant phyla, Proteobacteria and Ascomycota, align with findings from other pollen microbiome studies, unique core members were unidentified at genus level. This tree species-specific microbiome assembly emphasizes the crucial role of the host plant in shaping the pollen microbiome. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of pollen microbiomes in gymnosperms, shedding light on the need to look further at their ecological and functional roles.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789

Predictive processing has been repeatedly demonstrated and seemingly explains expectation suppression (ES), or the attenuation of neural activity in response to expected stimuli. However, the mechanisms behind ES are unclear and various models of the mechanisms supporting ES have been suggested with conflicting evidence. Sharpening models propose that expectations suppress neurons that are not tuned to the expected stimulus, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for expected stimuli. In contrast, dampening models posit that expectations suppress neurons that are tuned to the expected stimuli, increasing the relative response amplitude for unexpected stimuli. Previous studies have used decoding analyses to examine these effects, with increases in decoding accuracy interpreted in terms of sharpening and decreases related to dampening. The opposing process theory (OPT) has suggested that both processes may occur at different time points, namely that initial sharpening is followed by later dampening of the neural representations of the expected stimulus as learning progresses. In this study we aim to test this theory and shed light on the dynamics of expectation effects, both at single trial level and over time. Thirty-one participants completed a statistical learning task consisting of paired scene categories whereby a 'leading' image from one category is quickly followed by a 'trailing' image from a different category. Multivariate EEG analyses focussed on decoding stimulus information related to the trailing image category. Within-trial, decoding analyses showed that stimulus expectation increased decoding accuracy at early latencies and decreased decoding accuracy at later latencies, in line with OPT. However, across trials, stimulus expectation decreased decoding accuracy in initial trials and increased decoding accuracy in later trials. We theorise that these dissociable dynamics of expectation effects within and across trials can be explained in the context of hierarchical learning mechanisms. Our single trial results provide evidence for the OPT, while our results over time suggest that sharpening and dampening effects emerge at different stages of learning.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

However, the utility of IL2 as a treatment is limited by this same pleiotropy, and protein engineering to bias specificity towards either the regulatory T cell (Treg) or CD8 T cell lineage often requires a trade-off in protein production or total bioactivity. Here we use SolubiS, a computational algorithm-based method, to predict mutations within the IL2 structure to improve protein production yield while altering cellular selectivity, to generate a mutein with elevated therapeutic potential. The design and testing process identified the V126R (murine) / V111R (human) mutation as a Treg-enhancing mutein, creating a cation repulsion to inhibit primary binding to IL2RB, with a post-IL2RA confirmational shift enabling secondary IL2RB binding, and hence allowing the trimeric receptor complex to form. In human IL2, additional N110R T151R aggregation-protecting mutations could improve protein yield of the V111R mutation. The approach also generated novel CD8 T cell-promoting mutations. Y79K created a cation-cation repulsion with IL2RA, while Q50W enhanced CD8 T cell activity through potential {pi}-stacking enhancing binding to IL2RB, with the combination highly stimulatory for CD8 T cells. For human IL2, Y65K (homolog to murine Y79K) coupled with E82K prevented IL2RA binding, however it required the aggregation-protecting mutations of N110R T151R to rescue production. These muteins, designed with both cellular specificity and protein production features, have potential as both biological tools and therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of adaptation. We next used a dual-task methodology to examine the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Here, again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused or divided attention conditions. Interestingly, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: Attended stimuli serve as cues that define the context for learning. The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. Together, these results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789

This type of data is not a quantifiable resource for any kind of quantitative investigations and any manual review or structured information retrieval is time-consuming and costly. The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) mark a paradigm shift in natural language processing and offer new possibilities for structured Information Extraction (IE) from medical free text. This protocol describes a workflow for LLM based information extraction (LLM-AIx), enabling extraction of predefined entities from unstructured text using privacy preserving LLMs. By converting unstructured clinical text into structured data, LLM-AIx addresses a critical barrier in clinical research and practice, where the efficient extraction of information is essential for improving clinical decision-making, enhancing patient outcomes, and facilitating large-scale data analysis.

The protocol consists of four main processing steps: 1) Problem definition and data preparation, 2) data preprocessing, 3) LLM-based IE and 4) output evaluation. LLM-AIx allows integration on local hospital hardware without the need of transferring any patient data to external servers. As example tasks, we applied LLM-AIx for the anonymization of fictitious clinical letters from patients with pulmonary embolism. Additionally, we extracted symptoms and laterality of the pulmonary embolism of these fictitious letters. We demonstrate troubleshooting for potential problems within the pipeline with an IE on a real-world dataset, 100 pathology reports from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), for TNM stage extraction. LLM-AIx can be executed without any programming knowledge via an easy-to-use interface and in no more than a few minutes or hours, depending on the LLM model selected.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789

To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

In Toxoplasma gondii and several other apicomplexan parasites, some glycolytic enzymes have isoforms located in their plastid (called the apicoplast). In this organelle, glycolytic intermediates like glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) are imported from the cytosol and further metabolized, providing ATP, reducing power, and precursors for anabolic pathways such as isoprenoid synthesis. However, GAP and DHAP can spontaneously convert into methylglyoxal, a toxic by-product detoxified by the glyoxalase system, typically involving Glyoxalase-1 (Glo-1) and Glyoxalase-2 (Glo-2). In T. gondii, we identified an atypical protein, TgGloL, containing a Glo-1-like motif but with limited homology to typical Glo enzymes. TgGloL localizes to the apicoplast, and its conditional knockdown impairs parasite growth, indicating its importance. While a specific and direct role for TgGloL in methylglyoxal detoxification within the apicoplast remains unclear, it is crucial for maintaining organelle homeostasis and for overall parasite fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

The toroidal molecular architecture of the Hfq hexamer contains three well characterised surfaces which allow it to bind sRNAs to stabilise them and bind to target transcripts. Hfq-interacting sRNAs are categorised into two classes based on the surfaces they use to bind Hfq. By characterising a systematic alanine mutant library of Hfq to identify amino acid residues that impact survival of Escherichia coli experiencing nitrogen starvation, we corroborated the important role of the three RNA binding surfaces for Hfq function. Surprisingly, we uncovered two conserved residues, V22 and G34, in the hydrophobic core of Hfq, to have a significant role in Hfq's RNA binding activity. Alanine substitutions at these residues had no measurable impact on protein stability or equilibrium binding to target sRNAs in vitro. However, transcriptome-scale analysis revealed that V22A and G34A Hfq mutants cause widespread destabilisation of both sRNA classes.

However, disassembly of single CMGs that have stalled temporarily would be deleterious, suggesting that TRAIP must be carefully regulated. Here, we demonstrate that human cells lacking the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 are hypersensitive to topoisomerase poisons and other replication stress-inducing agents. We further show that TRAIP loss rescues the hypersensitivity of USP37 knockout cells to topoisomerase inhibitors. In Xenopus egg extracts depleted of USP37, TRAIP promotes premature CMG ubiquitylation and disassembly when converging replisomes stall. Finally, guided by AlphaFold-Multimer, we discovered that binding to CDC45 mediates USP37s response to topological stress. In conclusion, we propose that USP37 protects genome stability by preventing TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Recent studies have shown that the aberrant transition of monomeric aS into solid-like aggregates can occur via an intermediate liquid-like state, where the protein partitions between dense and dilute phases. Although aS is not typically recognized as an RNA-binding protein, it can bind RNA under aggregation conditions. However, the impact of RNA on aS dynamics within dilute and dense phases remains unclear. Here, we employ a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy techniques to explore aS dynamics in both phases in the presence of RNA. Our sensitive analysis of the dilute phase revealed the formation of precursor nanoclusters involved in initiating phase separation. We also uncovered heterogeneity within the dense phase, discovering that aS molecules exist in two distinct mobility states: freely diffusing molecules or confined within micro-domains. Additionally, RNA was found to induce morphological changes in the dense phase. Our quantitative analysis, based on fluorescence lifetime measurements, showed that RNA alters the liquid-like properties of the aS dense phase, promoting a liquid-to-solid transition. These findings indicate the active role of RNA in modulating the material properties of aS and influencing its phase transitions.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Our systematic investigation uncovered 588 interactions involving 168 chemicals, the majority of which were not previously reported to have antibacterial properties. Fungicides and industrial chemicals showed the largest impact with circa 30% exhibiting anti-commensal properties. We find that the sensitivity to chemical pollutants across species surprisingly correlates with that to human-targeted drugs, suggesting common susceptibility mechanisms. Using a genome-wide chemical-genetic screen, we identified membrane transport and fatty acid metabolism as major modulators of the off-target toxicity of chemicals. Mutants exhibiting chemical resistance include those defective in producing human-health-relevant metabolites like branched short-chain fatty acids, indicating that chronic exposure could lead to selection against production of beneficial metabolites. Toxicokinetic modelling suggested gut bacteria could be used as more sensitive in vitro toxicity indicators for chemicals of concern than animal models. Together, our data uncovers the off-target activity of industrial and agricultural chemicals with widespread exposure against human gut bacteria.

Replisome (dis)assembly is tightly coordinated with cell cycle progression to ensure genome stability. However, factors that prevent premature CMG unloading and replisome disassembly are poorly described. Since disassembly is catalyzed by ubiquitination, deubiquitinases (DUBs) represent attractive candidates for safeguarding against untimely and deleterious CMG unloading. We combined a targeted loss-of-function screen with quantitative, single-cell analysis to identify human USP37 as a key DUB preventing replisome disassembly. We demonstrate that USP37 maintains active replisomes on S-phase chromatin and promotes normal cell cycle progression. Proteomics and enzyme assays revealed USP37 interacts with the CMG complex to deubiquitinate MCM7, thus antagonizing replisome disassembly. Significantly, USP37 protects normal epithelial cells from oncoprotein-induced replication stress. Our findings reveal USP37 to be critical to the maintenance of replisomes in S-phase and suggest USP37-targeting as a potential strategy for treating malignancies with defective DNA replication control.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Here, we show that a gut-brain-gut circuit loop gates sugar ingestion in flies. We discovered that brain neurons regulating food ingestion, IN18, receive excitatory input from enteric sensory neurons, which innervate the oesophagus and express the sugar receptor Gr43a. These enteric sensory neurons monitor the sugar content of food within the oesophagus during ingestion and send positive feedback signals to IN1s, stimulating the consumption of high-sugar foods. Connectome analyses reveal that IN1s form a core ingestion circuit. This interoceptive circuit receives synaptic input from enteric afferents and provides synaptic output to enteric motor neurons, which modulate the activity of muscles at the entry segments of the crop, a stomach-like food storage organ. While IN1s are persistently activated upon ingestion of sugar-rich foods, enteric motor neurons are continuously inhibited, causing the crop muscles to relax and enabling flies to consume large volumes of sugar. Our findings reveal a key interoceptive mechanism that underlies the rapid sensory monitoring and motor control of sugar ingestion within the digestive tract, optimising the diet of flies across varying metabolic states.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Auxin-dependent transcriptional changes are mediated by DNA-binding Auxin Response Factors (ARF), whose AuxRE DNA binding sites are well-known. The identification of the first AuxRE showed this to be part of a composite element with a second motif. Indeed, systematic analysis showed other DNA motifs to be enriched in auxin-regulated promoters. Neither the basis for this enrichment nor the mechanisms for the activity of composite AuxREs is known. Here, we systematically mined Arabidopsis promoters for composite AuxRE elements enriched in auxin-responsive genes. We identified many and show that their presence is a reliable predictor of auxin response. Through mutating these elements and their higher-order modules, we demonstrate function in promoter activity. Lastly, we identified transcription factors (TFs) that bind AuxRE-associated motifs, showed their involvement in auxin response, and discovered that several of these TFs directly bind ARF proteins. We propose that ARF-TF complexes specifically bind compound motifs in promoters, and act as a source of diversification in auxin-dependent gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Available data support that the burst of cytokines and bradykinin, observed in some COVID-19 patients, sustains systemic inflammation and the hypercoagulant state, thus increasing thrombotic risk. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) can play a direct role in the activation of the coagulation cascade. Adding Mpro to human plasma from healthy donors increased clotting probability by 2.5-fold. The results of enzymatic assays and degradomics analysis indicate that Mpro triggers plasma clotting by proteolytically activating coagulation factors zymogens VII and XII at their physiological activation sites, i.e. Arg152-Ile153 bond for FVII and Arg353-Val354 bond for FXII, where FVII and FXII are strategically positioned at the very beginning of the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. These findings are not compatible with the substrate specificity of the protease known so far, displaying a prevalence for a Gln-residue in P1 and a hydrophobic amino acid in P2 position. This apparent discrepancy was resolved by High Throughput Protease Screen assay, unveiling an extended, time-dependent, secondary specificity of Mpro for Arg-X bonds, which was further confirmed by Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass spectrometry analysis of Arg-containing inhibitors binding to Mpro and by enzymatic assays showing that the protease can cleave peptide substrates containing Arg in P1.

Thousands of ATAC-seq samples have been collected that hold information about chromatin accessibility across diverse cell types and contexts, but most of these are not paired with genetic information and come from diverse distinct projects and laboratories. Results We report here joint genotyping, chromatin accessibility peak calling, and discovery of quantitative trait loci which influence chromatin accessibility (caQTLs), demonstrating the capability of performing caQTL analysis on a large scale in a diverse sample set without pre-existing genotype information. Using 10,293 profiling samples representing 1,454 unique donor individuals across 653 studies from public databases, we catalog 23,381 caQTLs in total. After joint discovery analysis, we cluster samples based on accessible chromatin profiles to identify context-specific caQTLs. We find that caQTLs are strongly enriched for annotations of gene regulatory elements across diverse cell types and tissues and are often strongly linked with genetic variation associated with changes in expression (eQTLs), indicating that caQTLs can mediate genetic effects on gene expression. We demonstrate sharing of causal variants for chromatin accessibility and diverse complex human traits, enabling a more complete picture of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex human phenotypes. Conclusions Our work provides a proof of principle for caQTL calling from previously ungenotyped samples, and represents one of the largest, most diverse caQTL resources currently available, informing mechanisms of genetic regulation of gene expression and contribution to disease.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

However, it is repeatedly reported that being observed by others tends to make people act more riskily. We hypothesized that this discrepancy arises from individuals' belief that others prefer riskier choices than they do. To examine this hypothesis, we used a gambling task where on some trials, individuals were informed that their choices would be observed by a risk-averse or seeking partner. Most important, individuals were given chances to learn each partner's preference beforehand. As expected, individuals initially believed that partners would make relatively riskier choices than they would. Against two alternative explanations, we found that individuals simulated partners' choices and weighed these simulated choices in making their own choices. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that decision probabilities adjusted with the simulated partners' choices were represented in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Moreover, individual differences in the functional connectivity between the TPJ and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were explained by the interaction between model-estimated social reliance and sensitivity to social cues in the mPFC. These findings provide a neuromechanistic account of how being observed by others affects individuals' decision-making, highlighting the roles of the mPFC and TPJ in simulating social contexts based on individuals' beliefs.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Once activated, they migrate towards injured sites, where they proliferate and differentiate to replenish lost or damaged cells. Although effective tissue repair relies critically on the ability of SCs to reach and populate damaged sites, mechanisms guiding SCs towards these sites are not well understood. This is largely due to the technical challenges involved in monitoring SC dynamics in real time in vivo. Here, we devised an experimental framework that allows for real-time tracking of the spatiotemporal dynamics of intestinal SCs (ISCs) during the early phases of gut regeneration. Our data show that ISC migration is rapidly induced following injury and precedes ISC divisions and differentiation. We identify the Drosophila PDGF-VEGF-related receptor, Pvr, as a critical regulator of the migratory response to epithelial damage. ISC-specific Pvr depletion strongly suppresses ISC migration towards affected sites as well as the regenerative response. We further show that the Pvr ligand, PDGF-VEGF-related factor 1 (Pvf1), is produced by the trachea/vasculature in response to intestinal damage and acts as a guidance signal to direct ISC migration towards affected areas. Our work highlights a critical role of gut-trachea/vasculature crosstalk in guiding ISC migration during regeneration. As neovascularization of injured sites is a key feature of tissue repair in both flies and mammals, these findings could be relevant to regenerative processes in a wide range of adult tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Using chemical and genetic tools, we demonstrate that hypoxia-induced airway differentiation is dependent on HIF (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor) pathways, with HIF1 and HIF2 differentially regulating fate decisions.

The developing conceptus (embryo and extra-embryonic membranes) secretes factors which modify the endometrium and can be critical for early pregnancy processes such maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) and enhancing uterine receptivity to implantation. For example, a competent bovine conceptus secretes IFNT to initiate MRP. The bovine conceptus also secretes other proteins at the time of MRP, including CAPG and PDI, which are highly conserved among placental mammals. We have previously shown that these proteins act upon the endometrium to modulate receptivity, embryo development, and implantation in species with different implantation strategies (humans and cattle). We hypothesise that developing a novel 3D bovine endometrium on a chip system will enhance our understanding of the role of conceptus-derived factors in altering the endometrium and/or ULF secretion. Here we have developed a 3D bovine endometrium on a chip system, comprising both stromal and epithelial cell culture combined with culture medium flow better mimics the in vivo endometrium and exposure to conceptus-derived factors than conventional 2D endometrial cell culture. We have demonstrated that the conceptus-derived proteins CAPG and PDI modulate the endometrial transcriptome and secretory response to promote pathways associated with early pregnancy and alter ULF composition. This work highlights the critical need for more robust and in vivo -like culture systems to study endometrial-conceptus interactions in vitro to further investigate the role of conceptus derived factors for pregnancy success.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe have developed an in vitro 3D bovine endometrium-on-a-chip system comprising both primary stromal cells under static conditions and epithelial cells under flow conditions to mimic the in vivo endometrial environment from the conceptuses perspective. The secretome of the 3D endometrium-on-a-chip was characterised, was found to contain proteins associated with cell adhesion and tissue development, and contained proteins previously identified in in vivo uterine luminal fluid. PDI and CAPG (previously identified conceptus-derived factors) altered the transcriptome and secretome of cells within the system. Exposure to CAPG or PDI altered the secretome of proteins previously identified in pregnant uterine luminal fluid or associated with early pregnancy, and exposure to CAPG or PDI also altered the transcriptome to support processes such as immune response, secretion, proliferation, and adhesion related pathways. This data supports previously published works and highlights the need for the use of more in vivo-like in vitro models to study conceptus-endometrial interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of patients with autism and co-morbid catatonia who received outpatient care in a specialized outpatient clinic from July 1st, 2021 to May 31st, 2024. Data investigating pharmacologic interventions, and clinical measures including the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), Kanner Catatonia Severity Scale (KCS), Kanner Catatonia Examination (KCE), and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) were collected. Results: Forty-five patients were identified with 39 (86.7%) meeting criteria for profound autism. All patients received pharmacotherapy. 44 (97.8%) were treated with benzodiazepines with a mean maximal daily dose of 17.4 mg (SD=15.8) lorazepam equivalents. Thirty-five patients (77.8%) required more than one medication class for treatment. Fourteen patients (31.1%) attempted to taper off benzodiazepines during the study period; of these, 5 patients (11.1%) were successfully tapered off, and the remaining 9 (17.8%) discontinued the taper due to a return of catatonic symptoms. Statistically significant improvement was observed across all clinical domains except the KCS. However, the majority remained symptomatic over the study period. Conclusions: Despite clinical improvements while receiving the gold standard for psychopharmacologic management of catatonia, chronic symptoms remained for the majority of catatonia patients over the study period, and few were able to taper and discontinue benzodiazepine treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789

Nevertheless, studies on the effectiveness of various tVNS protocols have produced heterogeneous results on pupil dilatation to date. Here, we synthesize the existing evidence and compare conventional continuous and pulsed stimulation protocols using Bayesian meta-analysis. To maintain a living version, we developed a Shiny App with the possibility to incorporate newly published studies in the future. Based on a systematic review, we included 18 studies (N = 771) applying either continuous or pulsed stimulation protocols. Across studies, we found anecdotal evidence for the alternative hypothesis that tVNS increases pupil size (g = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.29], BF01 = 2.5). Separating studies according to continuous vs. pulsed protocols revealed that results were driven by studies using pulsed taVNS (strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis: g = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.53], BF10 = 14.15) while continuous tVNS provided strong evidence for the null hypothesis (g = 0.01, CI = [-0.15, 0.16], BF01= 20.7). In conclusion, our meta-analysis highlights differential effects of continuous and pulsed tVNS protocols on pupil dilation. These findings underscore the relevance of tVNS protocols in optimizing its use for specific applications that may require modulation of tonic vs. phasic monoaminergic responses.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Recent advances in structural genomics have identified fungal effector families whose members adopt similar folds despite sequence divergence, highlighting their importance in virulence and immune evasion. To extend the scope of comparative structure-guided analysis to more evolutionarily distant phytopathogens with similar lifestyle, we used AlphaFold2 to predict the 3D structures of the secretome from selected plasmodiophorid, oomycete, and fungal gall-forming pathogens. Clustering of protein folds based on structural homology revealed species-specific expansions and a low abundance of known orphan effector families. We identified a nucleoside hydrolase-like fold, structurally homologous to the bacterial effector HopQ1, to be conserved among various gall-forming microbes. We also identified novel sequence-unrelated but structurally similar (SUSS) effector clusters, rich in conserved motifs. Notably, ankyrin proteins were significantly expanded in gall-forming plasmodiophorids, with AlphaFold-Multimer screening revealing the MAP kinase pathway as a major target of these proteins. Altogether, this study advances our understanding of secretome landscapes in gall-forming microbes and provides a valuable resource for broadening structural phylogenomic studies across diverse phytopathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

In low mitogen, low CDK environments cells exit the cell cycle into a non-proliferative quiescent state, G0, that plays essential roles in stem cell maintenance and cellular homeostasis. CIZ1 regulates cell cycle and epigenetic programmes, and CIZ1 ablation enhances genomic instability after release from quiescence. Here, we determined the mechanisms that promote genome instability in CIZ1 ablated cells using a combination of Fucci(CA) live cell imaging, cell-free DNA replication assays and DNA combing. Cell cycle dynamics are unaffected in CIZ1-/- (CIZ1 KO) fibroblasts; however, a specific post-quiescent phenotype is observed resulting in a reduced G1 phase and cell cycle length. The reduction in G1 length in CIZ1 KO cells is associated with increased cyclin E1/E2 and A2 expression, and enhanced phosphorylation of Rb leading to early restriction point bypass. CIZ1-/- cells are deficient in cyclin A chromatin binding and required increased cyclin-CDK activity for the initiation of DNA replication, which is associated with DNA replication stress in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, the CDK threshold for initiation of DNA replication was 2-fold higher in CIZ1 KO nuclei than parental controls. Importantly, addition of recombinant CIZ1 in vitro and in vivo promotes recruitment of cyclin A to chromatin and reinstates the CDK threshold for initiation of DNA replication, reversing DNA replication stress and increasing replication fork rates. Loss of CIZ1 is associated with dysregulated cyclin-CDK signalling, resulting in reduced G1 length, an increased CDK activity threshold required to promote initiation of DNA replication that results in DNA replication stress. These data suggest that CIZ1 facilitates recruitment of cyclin-CDK complexes to chromatin and contributes to the mechanisms that determine the threshold CDK activity required for the G1/S transition in post-quiescent cells. Taken together the data support a role for CIZ1 in the prevention of DNA replication stress and maintenance of genome stability.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

One area yet to be explored involves the somatosensory system. Using a novel sensorimotor technique, this study measured the somatosensory system in retired contact sport athletes exposed to repetitive neurotrauma.

Materials and MethodsRetired athletes (n=85, mean age 48.6 {+/-} 10.6 years, all male) completed a self-report survey on their playing career, number of concussions, and continuing symptoms. Participants completed somatosensory vibrotactile tasks assessing reaction time, amplitude discrimination (sequential, simultaneous), and temporal discrimination (temporal order judgment, duration discrimination). Participants were divided between those reporting persistent symptoms (""symptomatic"", n=63) and those without concerns (""non-symptomatic"", n=22).

Results""Symptomatic"" participants scored higher symptom scores compared to the ""non-symptomatic"" group (P<0.001). No differences were found between groups for age (P=0.152), number of concussions (P=0.193), total years played (P=0.385), or professional career length (P=0.711). ""Symptomatic"" group reaction times were slower to the ""non-symptomatic"" group (P<0.001). Reaction time variability were greater in the ""symptomatic"" group (P=0.002). Differences between groups were found for amplitude discrimination (sequential: P=0.031; simultaneous: P=0.036) and temporal order judgment (P=0.032). Significant correlations were found between total symptom scores and all somatosensory tasks. Correlations showed associations between total exposure years with temporal order judgement and reaction time.

ConclusionsThis novel study showed altered sensorimotor perception in retired athletes with persistent symptoms. Our data adds to the growing pathophysiological evidence in those who experience repetitive neurotrauma during their playing careers.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789

Pallatom directly learns and models the joint distribution P(structure, seq) by focusing on P(all-atom), effectively addressing the interdependence between sequence and structure in protein generation. To achieve this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for all-atom protein generation. Our model employs a dual-track framework that tokenizes proteins into token-level and atomic-level representations, integrating them through a multi-layer decoding process with traversing representations and recycling mechanism. We also introduce the atom14 representation method, which unifies the description of unknown side-chain coordinates, ensuring high fidelity between the generated all-atom conformation and its physical structure. Experimental results demonstrate that Pallatom excels in key metrics of protein design, including designability, diversity, and novelty, showing significant improvements across the board. Our model not only enhances the accuracy of protein generation but also exhibits excellent training efficiency, paving the way for future applications in larger and more complex systems.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Here, we performed RNA-sequencing on cells expressing the iFFL and utilized DECCODE, an unbiased computational method, to match our data with thousands of drug-induced transcriptional profiles. DECCODE identified compounds that consistently enhance expression of both transiently and stably expressed genetic payloads across various experimental scenarios and cell lines, while also reducing external perturbations on integrated genes.

The cause of these is not known, but they may be related to hypothalamic neurodegeneration.

MethodsWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE of studies using structural magnetic resonance imaging to examine hypothalamic volume in people with AD or LBD. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using the standardised mean difference (SMD) in hypothalamic volume as the effect measure, and a narrative synthesis was used to examine the relationship between hypothalamic volume and sleep, eating, and endocrine function.

ResultsWe identified 6542 articles which resulted in 12 included studies, most which had a low to moderate risk of bias. The meta-analysis included 454 people with mild-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State (MMSE) range: 19.2-26.1) and 715 controls. We found that people with AD had a significantly smaller hypothalamus (pooled SMD: -0.49, t=-3.47, p=0.018, 95%CI: -0.86 to - 0.13). There was significant heterogeneity of a moderate degree (Tau2=0.0665, 95%CI:0.005-0.8090; I2=67%, 95%CI:21.5%-86.1%; Q=15.16, p<0.01), but no evidence of publication bias. Only one study examined people with LBD, finding qualitative evidence of lower hypothalamic volume compared to controls. Hypothalamic volume loss in AD was more marked in men and may be associated with plasma levels of sex hormones and decreased bone mineral density.

ConclusionReduced hypothalamic volume is seen early in AD and LBD and this may influence endocrine function. A better understanding of hypothalamic degeneration in dementia may help elucidate how pathology relates to symptoms in AD and LBD and reveal new targets for intervention.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789

As a COG-UK partner, Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) in Norfolk sequenced over 87,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, contributing to the region becoming densely sequenced. Retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lineage dynamics in this region may contribute to preparedness for future pandemics. Methods: 29,406 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences and corresponding metadata from Norfolk were extracted from the COG-UK dataset, sampled between March 2020 and December 2022, representing 9.9% of regional COVID-19 cases. Sequences were lineage typed using Pangolin, and subsequent lineage analysis carried out in R using RStudio and related packages, including graphical analysis using ggplot2. Results: 401 global lineages were identified, with 69.8% appearing more than once and 31.2% over ten times. Temporal clustering identified six lineage communities based on first lineage emergence. Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern (VOC) accounted for 8.6%, 34.9% and 48.5% of sequences respectively. These formed four regional epidemic waves alongside the remaining lineages which appeared in the early pandemic prior to VOC designation and were termed pre-VOC lineages. Regional comparison highlighted variability in VOC epidemic wave dates dependent on location. Conclusion: This study is the first to assess SARS-CoV-2 diversity in Norfolk across a large timescale within the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 was both highly diverse and dynamic throughout the Norfolk region between March 2020 - December 2022, with a strong VOC presence within the latter two thirds of the study period. The study also displays the utility of incorporating genomic epidemiological methods into pandemic response.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Moreover, we propose an approach to tracking validation via dual-channel sparse labeling that enables high-fidelity ground truth generation, pushing the boundaries of long-term cell tracking assessment. Our method is freely available as a Python package with Fiji and napari plugins and can be deployed in a high-performance computing environment, facilitating widespread adoption by the research community.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Surprisingly, the strongest relationship was between developmental noise and macroevolutionary divergence-levels thought to be the most distant-whereas the relationship between standing genetic variation and population divergence was modest, despite established theoretical predictions.

To enable precision health, it is essential to understand how genetic variants contribute to earlier death or prolonged survival. In this study, we tested the association of common genetic variants and the burden of rare non-synonymous variants in a survival analysis, using age-at-death (N = 35,551, median [min, max] = 72.4 [40.9, 85.2]), and last-known-age (N = 358,282, median [min, max] = 71.9 [52.6, 88.7]), in European ancestry participants of the UK Biobank. The associations we identified seemed predominantly driven by cancer, likely due to the age range of the cohort. Common variant analysis highlighted three longevity-associated loci: APOE, ZSCAN23, and MUC5B. We identified six genes whose burden of loss-of-function variants is significantly associated with reduced lifespan: TET2, ATM, BRCA2, CKMT1B, BRCA1 and ASXL1. Additionally, in eight genes, the burden of pathogenic missense variants was associated with reduced lifespan: DNMT3A, SF3B1, CHL1, TET2, PTEN, SOX21, TP53 and SRSF2. Most of these genes have previously been linked to oncogenic-related pathways and some are linked to and are known to harbor somatic variants that predispose to clonal hematopoiesis. A direction-agnostic (SKAT-O) approach additionally identified significant associations with C1orf52, TERT, IDH2, and RLIM, highlighting a link between telomerase function and longevity as well as identifying additional oncogenic genes.

Here we show that the neuronal SNARE complex proteins syntaxin and SNAP25, which enable synaptic transmission in the nervous system, inhibit the activity of the NALCN channel complex in both heterologous systems and primary neurons. The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signalling directly, and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction may offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein-containing complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

This process requires learning the states of the world as well as the transitional relationships between those states. The hippocampal cognitive map is believed to be one such internal model8. However, evidence for predictive coding9-12 and reward sensitivity13-19 in the hippocampal neuronal representation suggests that its role extends beyond purely spatial representation. In fact, it raises the question of what kind of spatial representation is most useful for learning and maximizing future rewards? Here, we track the evolution of reward representation over weeks as mice learn to solve a cognitively demanding reward-based task. Our findings reveal a highly organized restructuring of hippocampal reward representations during the learning process. Specifically, we found multiple lines of evidence, both at the population and single-cell levels, that hippocampal representation becomes predictive of reward over weeks. Namely, both population-level information about reward and the percentage of reward-tuned neurons decrease over time. At the same time, the representation of the animals choice and reward approach period (the period between choice and reward) increased over time. By tracking individual reward cells across sessions, we found that neurons initially tuned for reward shifted their tuning towards choice and reward approach periods, indicating that reward cells backpropagate their tuning to anticipate reward with experience. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of hippocampal representations, highlighting their critical role in learning through the prediction of future outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

While altered ER-associated processes are linked to age-onset pathogenesis, whether shifts in ER morphology underlie these functional changes is unclear. We report that ER remodeling is a conserved feature of the aging process in models ranging from yeast to C. elegans and mammals. Focusing on C. elegans as an exemplar of metazoan aging, we find that as animals age, ER mass declines in virtually all tissues and ER morphology shifts from rough sheets to tubular ER. The accompanying large-scale shifts in proteomic composition correspond to the ER turning from protein synthesis to lipid metabolism. To drive this substantial remodeling, ER-phagy is activated early in adulthood, promoting turnover of rough ER in response to rises in luminal protein-folding burden and reduced global protein synthesis. Surprisingly, ER remodeling is a pro-active and protective response during aging, as ER-phagy impairment limits lifespan in yeast and diverse lifespan-extending paradigms promote profound remodeling of ER morphology even in young animals. Altogether our results reveal ER-phagy and ER morphological dynamics as pronounced, underappreciated mechanisms of both normal aging and enhanced longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Retinoic acid (RA) is known to specify proximal limb identity, but how RA signaling levels are established in the blastema is unknown. Here, we show that RA breakdown via CYP26B1 is essential for determining RA signaling levels within blastemas. CYP26B1 inhibition molecularly reprograms distal blastemas into a more proximal identity, phenocopying the effects of administering excess RA. We identify Shox as an RA-responsive gene that is differentially expressed between proximally and distally amputated limbs. Ablation of Shox results in shortened limbs with proximal skeletal elements that fail to initiate endochondral ossification. These results suggest that PD positional identity is determined by RA degradation and RA-responsive genes that regulate PD skeletal element formation during limb regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

SCRIVENER combines bacterial conjugation, in vivo DNA cutting, and in vivo homologous recombination to seamlessly stitch blocks of DNA together by mating E. coli in large arrays or pools. This workflow is simpler, cheaper, and higher throughput than current DNA assembly approaches that require DNA to be moved in and out of cells at different procedural steps. We perform over 5,000 assemblies with two to 13 DNA blocks that range from 240 bp to 8 kb and show that SCRIVENER is capable of assembling constructs as long as 23 kb at relatively high throughput and fidelity. Most SCRIVENER errors are deletions between long interspersed repeats. However, SCRIVENER can overcome these errors by enabling assembly and sequence verification at high replication at a nominal additional cost per replicate. We show that SCRIVENER can be used to build combinatorial libraries in arrays or pools, and that DNA blocks onboarded into the platform can be repurposed and reused with any other DNA block in high throughput without a PCR step. Because of these features, DNA engineering with SCRIVENER has the potential to accelerate design-build-test-learn cycles of DNA products.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Despite their prevalence, the identity of the transporters required for distribution of these herbicides in plants is both poorly understood and the subject of controversial debate 3,4. Here we show that PIN-FORMED auxin transporters transport a range of phenoxyacetic acid herbicides across the membrane and we characterize the molecular determinants of this process using a variety of different substrates as well as protein mutagenesis to control substrate specificity.

These structures represent five key states from the transport cycle, allowing us to describe conformational changes associated with substrate binding and transport across the membrane.

Previous studies have identified phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming as early predictors. However, the graphic complexity of Arabic letters imposes particular constraints on the visual system, which should mobilize visual attention. To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes. However, regression analyses showed that the relationship between visual attention span and reading disappeared when letter knowledge was taken-into-account. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual attention span to reading. Results showed that phonological awareness and letter knowledge were significant and independent predictors of reading while visual attention span contributed only indirectly through its influence on letter knowledge. Our findings suggest that beginning readers rely on visual attention to identify and discriminate visually-complex Arabic letters. In turn, more efficient letter identification in children with higher visual attention facilitates reading acquisition. These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system. They open new perspectives for cross-language studies, suggesting that visual attention might contribute differently to reading depending on the orthographic system. They also provide a foundation for innovative teaching methodologies in Arabic language education.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Here, we assay the levels, distribution pattern, and mobility of E-cadherin during Drosophila gastrulation. Indicating a maturation, we find an increase in total levels at junctions and a drop in the mobile fraction of E-cadherin molecules. Both developmental changes depend on Myo-II contractility. Consistent with stereotypic Myo-II regulation, we find that interference with Rho signaling leads to corresponding changes in E-cadherin levels and mobility, at least in part.

While initial cell cultures contained myoblasts, continued passaging led to a decline in myoblast characteristics and an increase in fibroblast-like cells. RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR analyses showed significant downregulation of well-established markers for satellite cells and myoblasts, such as pax7a and myoD, over successive passages, highlighting a loss of myoblastic traits. Single-cell cloning was employed to overcome this challenge and maintain myoblast purity, leading to the successful creation of the JEM1129 cell line. These JEM1129 cells demonstrated enhanced expression of myoblast marker genes, exceeding the initial primary culture cell population. The cells showed strong myotube formation, particularly when cultured in a differentiation medium, indicating their robust potential for muscle development. The JEM1129 cell line represents a significant advancement in the cultivation of eel muscle cells, offering a promising avenue for cultured meat production.

In rod-shaped bacteria, the Rod complex inserts peptidoglycan polymers into the cell wall circumferentially, generating material anisotropy that promotes anisotropic growth. Wall teichoic acids, an abundant, non-load-bearing component of the Gram-positive cell wall, are also essential for rod-shape for unknown reasons. Here, we report a direct role for wall teichoic acids in anisotropic peptidoglycan synthesis. We show that wall teichoic acids provide a cohesive cell wall substrate that is required for Rod complex activity; conversely, removing wall teichoic acids yields a porous cell wall incapable of sustaining Rod complex activity. Consistent with this, cell elongation and Rod complex motion arrest in cells depleted for wall teichoic acids, but resume following hyperosmotic shocks that contract the cell wall. We further show that cells lacking wall teichoic acids rely instead on the bifunctional peptidoglycan synthesis enzyme PBP1, whose isotropic peptidoglycan synthesis is responsible for the subsequent growth and loss of shape. Taken together, these findings reveal that the microstructure of the Gram-positive cell wall is an essential regulatory factor in its own synthesis.

SummaryThe bacterial cell wall is an essential macromolecule that encapsulates the cell and confers cell shape. Here, we reveal that an abundant yet understudied cell wall component in Gram-positive bacteria, wall teichoic acids, facilitates cell wall synthesis in the rod-shaped model organism Bacillus subtilis by conferring a physically cohesive substrate for cell wall biosynthetic enzymes. This finding explains the decades-old mystery of why cells that lack wall teichoic acids lose cell shape and grow slowly, while also highlighting an underappreciated factor impacting cell wall homeostasis: the microstructure of the wall itself.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Similar to motor skill learning in mammals, vocal learning in songbirds requires a set of interconnected brain areas that make up an analogous basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). Although neural activity in the AFP has been extensively investigated during awake singing, very little is known about its neural activity patterns during offline sleep periods.

In this work, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate neural activity in the AFP during offline periods of natural sleep. We found that neurons in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) transitioned from sparse synchronous firing to asynchronous firing during sleep, which corresponded to slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, respectively. SWS periods were associated with increased spiking variability for LMAN neurons, but not for neurons in the striatal region Area X (proper name). Coinciding with the increased spiking variability, we observed that populations of LMAN neurons were co-activated at specific time points during sleep in bursting events that were characterized by a negative deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. Overall, the LMAN population bursting events were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity observed in rodent hippocampus.

Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong cross-area field coherence between LMAN and Area X, although individual LMAN-Area X LFP pairs did show coherence > 0.5. These results provide the first description of cross-area dynamics within the AFP during sleep. Furthermore, the observation of SWR-like events during sleep in LMAN suggests that large-scale population events have diverse functions across vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Here we explore the potential of transcription factor (TF) recognition element arrays as DNA tools for modifying free TF levels in cells and thereby controlling gene expression. We first demonstrate proof-of-concept, showing that Tet TF-binding recognition element (RE) arrays of different lengths can tune gene expression and alter gene circuit performance in a predictable manner. We then open-up the approach to interface with any TF with a known binding site by developing a new method called Cloning Troublesome Repeats in Loops (CTRL) that can assemble plasmids with up to 256 repeats of any RE sequence. Transfection of RE array plasmids assembled by CTRL into mammalian cells show potential to modify host cell gene regulation at longer array sizes by sequestration of the TF of interest. RE array plasmids built using CTRL were demonstrated to target both synthetic and native mammalian TFs, illustrating the ability to use these tools to modulate genetic circuits and instruct cell fate. Together this work advances our ability to assemble repetitive DNA arrays and showcases the use of TF-binding RE arrays as a method for manipulating mammalian gene expression, thus expanding the possibilities for mammalian cell engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Prior to moulting, epidermal tissue peels off from the old cuticle and grows non-uniformly to shape protruding appendages, which are often branching, curving, or twisting, from the planar epidermis. This non-uniform growth is possibly regulated by the distribution of morphogens on the epidermal cell sheet. Previous studies have identified molecules and signalling pathways related to such morphogenesis; however, how local regulation of cell sheet growth can transform planar epidermis globally into complex three-dimensional structures, such as beetle horns, remains unclear. To reveal the relationship between epidermal growth regulation and generated structures, this study theoretically examined how various shapes can be generated from planar epidermis under a deductive growth model that corresponds morphogen distributions to non-uniform growth on tissue. The results show that the heterochronic expression of multiple morphogens can flexibly fuse multiple simple shapes to generate various structures emulating complex appendages of beetles. These findings indicate that morphogenesis through such a mechanism may have developmental stability and modularity, providing insights into the evolution of the diverse morphology of arthropods.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We experimentally tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

For example, p53 deficiency in some mice has been shown to rescue premature aging while others display significant aging phenotype when p53-deficient. This study seeks to elucidate, structurally and mechanistically, p53s roles in longevity. Through a relative evolutionary scoring (RES) algorithm, we quantify the level of evolutionary change in the residues of p53 across organisms of varying average lifespans in six taxonomic orders. Secondly, we used PEPPI to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53-or p53-linked proteins-and known senescence-regulating proteins across organisms in the orders Primates and Perciformes. Our RES algorithm found variations in the alignments within and across orders, suggesting that mechanisms of p53-mediated regulation of longevity may vary. PEPPI results suggest that longer-lived species may have evolved to regulate induction and inhibition of cellular senescence better than their shorter-lived counterparts. With experimental verification, these predictions could help elucidate the mechanisms of p53-mediated cellular senescence, ultimately clarifying our understanding of p53s connection to aging in a multiple-species context.

Author summaryThe p53 tumor suppressor protein protects our genome from cancers by repairing DNA damage, regulating cell death and/or pushing cells to a state where they become permanently unable to divide (known as cellular senescence). An accumulation of senescent cells produces various molecular features of aging in both mouse and human cellular models-thus linking p53 to the aging process. However, the molecular mechanism by which p53 regulates aging and its structural implications on this regulation are not clear. In this study, we assessed quantitatively the evolutionary differences in p53 sequences of organisms across several taxonomical orders to determine if there is a relationship between average lifespan and sequence evolution. In addition, we used a protein-protein interaction tool to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53, or p53-associated protein, and various senescence-associated proteins across organisms of various lifespans in two taxonomic orders: Primates and Perciformes. An elucidation of p53 structural difference and mechanistic proteomic network linked to p53 regulation of cellular senescence could advance therapeutics targeting abnormal aging.","NA","biorxiv",1725660507789

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725660507789
