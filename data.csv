This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.
C_LIO_LIAwareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after COVID-19 can lead to a timely referral, investigations, and management of these conditions in children and adolescents.

In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, transmission, and intervention strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Notably, certain choanoflagellate species can engage in facultative multicellular development resembling the early stages of embryogenesis. In the past few years, Salpingoeca rosetta has emerged as a tractable model for choanoflagellate cell biology and multicellular development, notably through mutant screens and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout (KO). However, existing KO pipelines have variable and sometimes low efficiency, frequently requiring isolation and genotyping of hundreds of clones without guarantee to obtain a KO strain. Here, we present a robust method for gene inactivation in S. rosetta that relies on insertion by CRISPR/Cas9 of a single 1.9 kb cassette encoding both a premature termination sequence and an antibiotic resistance gene. We show that this approach allows robust, fast and efficient isolation of KO clones after antibiotic selection. As a proof of principle, we first knocked out all three genes previously proposed to regulate S. rosetta multicellular development in a published mutant screen (rosetteless, couscous and jumble), and confirmed all three KOs abolished multicellular development. Whole genome sequencing revealed a unique specific insertion of the termination/resistance cassette in KO strains. To showcase the potential of this method for de novo characterization of candidate developmental genes, we then inactivated three genes encoding homologs of components of the Hippo pathway, which controls cell proliferation and multicellular size in animals: hippo, warts and yorkie. Interestingly, warts KO rosettes were consistently about twice larger than their wild-type counterparts, indicating that our KO pipeline has the potential to rapidly reveal novel loss-of-function phenotypes of biological interest. We propose that this method has the potential to accelerate choanoflagellate functional genetics.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

In order to determine the N, the usual approach is to perform a power calculation, which involves understanding the variability between samples and the expected effect size. Here, we focused on bulk RNA-seq experiments, which have become ubiquitous in biology, but which have many unknown or difficult to estimate parameters, and so the required analyses to determine the minimum N is typically lacking. We therefore performed two N=30 profiling studies between wild-type mice and mice in which one copy of a gene had been deleted, to determine how many mice would be required to minimize false positives and to maximize true discoveries found in the N of 30 experiment. Results from experiments with N=4 or less are shown to be highly misleading, given the substantial false positive rate, and the lack of discovery of genes later found with higher N. For a cut-off of 2-fold expression differences, we found that an N of 6-7 mice was required to consistently decrease the false positive rate to below 50%, and that ""more is always better"" when it came to discovery rates - an N of 8-12 is significantly better in lowering the false positive rate.

A common method to reduce false discovery rate in underpowered experiments is to raise the fold cutoff or increase the stringency of the P-value and include only highly perturbed, highly significant genes. We show that while this strategy is no substitute for increasing the N of the experiment, because it results in consistently inflated effect sizes and a substantial drop in sensitivity. These data should be helpful to others in choosing their Ns, since its often not practical to do such large studies for every mouse model.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Existing RNA sequencing methods have significant limitations: short-read (SR) sequencing provides high depth but struggles with isoform deconvolution, whereas long-read (LR) sequencing offers isoform resolution at the cost of lower depth, higher noise, and technical biases. Addressing this gap, we introduce Multi-Platform Aggregation and Quantification of Transcripts (MPAQT), a generative model that combines the complementary strengths of different sequencing platforms to achieve state-of-the-art isoform-resolved transcript quantification, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and experimental benchmarks. By applying MPAQT to an in vitro model of human embryonic stem cell differentiation into cortical neurons, followed by machine learning-based modeling of transcript abundances, we show that untranslated regions (UTRs) are major determinants of isoform proportion and exon usage; this effect is mediated through isoform-specific sequence features embedded in UTRs, which likely interact with RNA-binding proteins that modulate mRNA stability. These findings highlight MPAQT's potential to enhance our understanding of transcriptomic complexity and underline the role of splicing-independent post-transcriptional mechanisms in shaping the isoform and exon usage landscape of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Yet, viral ecology and evolution remain understudied in these environments. Here, we identified 49,962 viruses from 52 globally distributed hydrothermal vent samples (10 plumes, 40 deposits, and 2 diffuse flow), and reconstructed 5,708 viral metagenome-assembled genomes (vMAGs), the majority of which were bacteriophages. Hydrothermal viruses were largely endemic. However, some viruses were shared between geographically separated vents, predominantly between the Lau Basin and Brothers Volcano in the Pacific Ocean. Geographically distant viruses often shared proteins related to core functions such as structural proteins, and rarely, proteins of auxiliary functions. Common microbial hosts of viruses included members of Campylobacterota, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria in deposits, and Gammaproteobacteria in plumes. Campylobacterota- and Gammaproteobacteria-infecting viruses reflected variations in hydrothermal chemistry and functional redundancy in their predicted microbial hosts, suggesting that hydrothermal geology is a driver of viral ecology and coevolution of viruses and hosts. Our study indicates that viral ecology and evolution in globally distributed hydrothermal vents is shaped by endemism, and thus may have increased susceptibility to the negative impacts of deep-sea mining and anthropogenic change in ocean ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely considered a key contributing mechanism to muscle aging. However, mounting evidence position physical activity as a confounding factor, making unclear whether muscle mitochondria accumulate bona fide defects with aging. To disentangle aging from physical activity-related mitochondrial adaptations, we functionally profiled skeletal muscle mitochondria in 51 inactive and 88 active men aged 20-93. Physical activity status conferred partial protection against age-related decline in physical performance. A trend for reduced muscle mitochondrial respiration with aging was observed in inactive but not in active participants, indicating that aging per se does not alter mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was unaffected by aging and active participants displayed higher ROS production. In contrast, mitochondrial calcium retention capacity decreased with aging regardless of physical activity status and correlated with muscle mass, performance and the stress-responsive metabokine GDF15. Targeting mitochondrial calcium handling may hold promise for treating aging-related muscle impairments.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Sexual harassment is an unethical and illegal conduct. Yet, medical students are at a unique disadvantage to be victimized to due organizational failures, fear of retaliation, and unique power dynamics. As more women, minorities, and vulnerable groups enter the medical field, the time is ripe for proactive measures to ensure their empowerment and protect in light of such heinous and harmful acts.

Main body of the abstractOriginal research studies, which examined the sexual harassment of medical students were identified on the PubMed database using the key terms, ""sexual harassment"", and ""medical students"". A total of 36 studies were identified. The purpose of this review is to highlight the key findings in the original research literature on the sexual harassment of medical students, and to identify themes in hopes to inspire progressive solutions to embolden student safety.

Short conclusionThere is a growing global body of literature that has examined the sexual harassment experiences of medical students. Themes across the studies reveal a wide array of experiences. Medical students, especially females, are faced with harassment from professors, colleagues, and patients. The impact of harassment is far reaching, and includes depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, loss of concentration and academic interests, changing specialty of interest and relocation. There is a number of barriers to reporting these events, notably including a lack of institutional response, lack of time to go forward with a complaint, fear of retaliation and career impact. Proactive measures are needed to protect the students and embolden them and provide them with safe and accessible means to reporting these events, as well as ensuring adequate responses to reports on the institutional level, and continued emotional and career support are needed.","NA","medrxiv",1720994802307

In this study, we employed metagenomics to examine the ecological roles of the atmospheric microbiome, including the dispersal of potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, and its response to temperature fluctuations and dust storms intensified by climate change. We analyzed air samples from non-dusty conditions and Middle Eastern dust storms, identifying several facultative pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Aspergillus fumigatus, linked to human respiratory diseases, and others like Zymoseptoria tritici, Fusarium poae, and Puccinia striiformis, harmful to wheat, associated with dust storms and rising temperatures. We observed increased functions related to antibiotic resistance, including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, and virulence factors during dust storms. Our findings suggest that dust storms may spread these traits. Continuous monitoring is crucial to understand the broader implications of dust storms and temperature increases on the atmospheric microbiome amid climate change, emphasizing the need for a One Health approach to global climate challenges.

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

The key component of this system, ParB, loads and spreads along DNA to form a local protein-DNA condensate known as a partition complex. As bacterial chromosomes are heavily supercoiled due to the continuous action of RNA polymerases, gyrases, and nucleoid-associated proteins, it is important to study the impact of DNA supercoiling on the ParB-DNA partition complex formation. Here, we use an in vitro single-molecule assay to visualize ParB on supercoiled DNA. Unlike most DNA-binding proteins, individual ParB proteins are found to not pin plectonemes on supercoiled DNA, but freely diffuse along supercoiled DNA. We find that DNA supercoiling enhances ParB-DNA condensation which initiates at lower ParB concentrations than on DNA that is torsionally relaxed. ParB proteins induce a DNA-protein condensate that strikingly absorbs all supercoiling writhe. Our findings provide mechanistic insights that have important implications for our understanding of bacterial chromosome organization and segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Even with broad-scale efforts to characterize the effects of molecular perturbations and interpret gene coexpression, it remains challenging to infer the architecture of gene regulation in a precise and efficient manner. Key properties of GRNs, like hierarchical structure, modular organization, and sparsity, provide both challenges and opportunities for this objective. Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study. With deeper analysis of these exemplar networks, we consider future avenues to map the architecture of gene expression regulation using data from cells in perturbed and unperturbed states, finding that while perturbation data are critical to discover specific regulatory interactions, data from unperturbed cells may be sufficient to reveal regulatory programs.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

A recent application of this technique was used in a high-profile analysis in JAMA Internal Medicine to estimate the effect of cefepime, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, on mortality in severe infection. There has been ongoing concern that piperacillin-tazobactam, another broad-spectrum antibiotic with greater anaerobic activity might be inferior to cefepime, however this has not been shown in randomized controlled trials. The authors used an international shortage of piperacillin-tazobactam as an instrument, as during this shortage period, cefepime was used as an alternative. The authors report a strong mortality effect (5% absolute increase) with piperacillin-tazobactam. In this paper, we closely examine this estimate and find it is likely conditional on inclusion of a control variable (metronidazole usage). Inclusion of this variable is highly likely to lead to collider bias, which we show via simulation. We then generate estimates unadjusted for metronidazole which are much closer to the null and may represent residual confounding or confounding by indication. We highlight the ongoing challenge of collider bias in empirical IV analyses and the potential for large biases to occur. We finally suggest the authors consider including these unadjusted estimates in their manuscript, as the large increase in mortality reported with piperacillin-tazobactam is unlikely to be true.","NA","medrxiv",1720994802307

This study tested whether canonical additive and multiplicative neural computations, well-described in sensory systems, generalize to the corticospinal pathway during human action preparation. We used non-invasive brain stimulation to measure corticospinal input-output across varying action preparation contexts during instructed-delay finger response tasks. Goal-directed action preparation was marked by increased multiplicative gain of corticospinal projections to task-relevant muscles and additive suppression of corticospinal projections to non-selected and task-irrelevant muscles. Individuals who modulated corticospinal gain to a greater extent were faster to initiate prepared responses. Our findings provide physiological evidence of combined additive suppression and gain modulation in the human motor system. We propose these computations support action preparation by enhancing the contrast between selected motor representations and surrounding background activity to facilitate response selection and execution.

Significance statementNeural computations determine what information is transmitted through brain circuits. We investigated whether the motor system uses computations similar to those observed in sensory systems by noninvasively stimulating the corticospinal pathway in humans during movement preparation. We discovered that corticospinal projections to behaviorally relevant muscles exhibit nonlinear gain computations, while projections to behaviorally irrelevant muscles exhibit linear suppression. Notably, individuals with stronger signatures of these computations had faster motor responses. Our findings suggest that certain computational principles generalize to the human motor system and serve to enhance the contrast between relevant and background neural activity.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

These hotspots operate in tandem to optimize both receptor binding for effective infection and immune evasion efficiency, thereby maintaining overall viral fitness. The lack of molecular details on structure, dynamics and binding energetics of the latest FLiRT and FLuQE variants with the ACE2 receptor and antibodies provides a considerable challenge that is explored in this study. We combined AlphaFold2-based atomistic predictions of structures and conformational ensembles of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike complexes with the host receptor ACE2 for the most dominant Omicron variants JN.1, KP.1, KP.2 and KP.3 to examine the mechanisms underlying the role of convergent evolution hotspots in balancing ACE2 binding and antibody evasion. Using the ensemble-based mutational scanning of the spike protein residues and computations of binding affinities, we identified binding energy hotspots and characterized molecular basis underlying epistatic couplings between convergent mutational hotspots. The results suggested that the existence of epistatic interactions between convergent mutational sites at L455, F456, Q493 positions that enable to protect and restore ACE2 binding affinity while conferring beneficial immune escape. To examine immune escape mechanisms, we performed structure-based mutational profiling of the spike protein binding with several classes of antibodies that displayed impaired neutralization against BA.2.86, JN.1, KP.2 and KP.3. The results confirmed the experimental data that JN.1, KP.2 and KP.3 harboring the L455S and F456L mutations can significantly impair the neutralizing activity of class-1 monoclonal antibodies, while the epistatic effects mediated by F456L can facilitate the subsequent convergence of Q493E changes to rescue ACE2 binding. Structural and energetic analysis provided a rationale to the experimental results showing that BD55-5840 and BD55-5514 antibodies that bind to different binding epitopes can retain neutralizing efficacy against all examined variants BA.2.86, JN.1, KP.2 and KP.3. The results support the notion that evolution of Omicron variants may favor emergence of lineages with beneficial combinations of mutations involving mediators of epistatic couplings that control balance of high ACE2 affinity and immune evasion.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

In doing so, SARS-CoV-2 infection perturbs bioactive lipid levels associated with the inflammatory response. One of these, Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is suppressed during SARS-CoV-2 infection since it activates the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor- (PPAR-), a transcription factor that suppresses the nuclear factor-B (NF-{kappa}B), which is mandatory to sustain SARS-CoV-2 replication. PEA levels are regulated by N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), a lysosomal enzyme responsible for catalysing the breakdown of PEA. We hypothesized that NAAA inhibition might interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication since it will lead PEA to accumulate, activating PPAR- and, consequently, suppressing NF-{kappa}B.

Our results reveal that genetic or chemical ablation of NAAA significantly suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication by three log10 in human-derived precision-cut lung slices. Therefore, we investigated whether inhibiting NAAA could influence NF-{kappa}B activation through the activation of PPAR-. We observed PPAR- increased expression in NAAA-/-cells, while PPAR- expression remained low in infected parental cells. As expected, the elevated PPAR- expression correlated with a parallel reduction in NF-{kappa}B activation when NAAA is ablated. These findings underscore NAAA as an essential host factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication and propose a potential mechanism of action rooted in the attenuation of NF-{kappa}B activation during viral replication.

Author summaryOver the past three years, COVID-19 has claimed nearly 7 million lives worldwide, prompting extensive efforts to find effective treatments. While RNA-based vaccines have been developed rapidly, they alone have not completely halted the spread of the virus, making the search for antiviral therapies crucial. One promising approach targets the anti-inflammatory lipid PEA, which has shown some success in COVID-19 clinical trials. PEA is quickly degraded by the enzyme NAAA. Researchers have found that inhibiting NAAA can enhance and prolong PEA anti-inflammatory effects. NAAA inhibitors have already shown effectiveness in reducing chronic pain and lung inflammation in animal models and have also been effective against Zika virus replication. Our research focused on testing the NAAA inhibitor ARN726 against SARS-CoV-2. In human lung cells and lung tissue samples, ARN726 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and inflammation. We discovered that this inhibition suppresses the NF-{kappa}B pathway, which the virus uses to fuel its replication and sustain Cytokine storm. Overall, our findings suggest that NAAA inhibitors like ARN726 could be repurposed to combat COVID-19 and potentially other coronaviruses, offering a novel and effective antiviral strategy.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

How these regions communicate to organize retrieval-specific processing, however, remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the role of theta (3--8 Hz) synchronization, broadly implicated in memory function, during the spontaneous retrieval of episodic memories. Analyzing a dataset of 413 neurosurgical patients implanted with intracranial electrodes who completed a free recall task, we find that synchronous networks of theta phase synchrony span the brain in the moments before spontaneous recall, in comparison to periods of deliberation and incorrect recalls. Network hubs, which systematically synchronize with other regions, appear throughout the prefrontal cortex and lateral and medial temporal lobes, as well as other areas. The recall accuracy network, derived from a correct recall--intrusion contrast, includes synchronous hubs concentrated in the temporal lobe and desynchronous hubs in the parietal lobe. Theta synchrony increases appear more prominently for slow (3 Hz) theta than for fast (8 Hz) theta in the recall--deliberation contrast, but not in the encoding or recall--intrusion contrast, and theta power and synchrony positively correlate throughout the theta band. These results implicate diffuse brain-wide synchronization of theta rhythms, especially slow theta, in episodic memory retrieval.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

While all immature and mature human NK cells co-express SYK and ZAP70, clonally driven memory or adaptive NK cells can methylate SYK genes and signaling is mediated exclusively using ZAP70. Here, we examined the role of SYK and ZAP70 in a clonal human NK cell line KHYG1 by CRISPR-based deletion using a combination of experiments and mechanistic computational modeling. Elimination of SYK resulted in more robust Ca++ influx after cross-linking of the CD16 and NKp30 receptors and enhanced phosphorylation of downstream proteins, whereas ZAP70 deletion diminished these responses. By contrast, ZAP70 depletion increased proliferation of the NK cells. As immature T cells express both SYK and ZAP70 but mature T cells often express only ZAP70, we transduced the human Jurkat cell line with SYK and found that expression of SYK increased proliferation but diminished TCR-induced Ca2+ flux and activation. We performed transcriptional analysis of the matched sets of variant Jurkat and KHYG1 cells and observed profound alterations caused by SYK expression. As depletion of SYK in NK cells increased their activation, primary human NK cells were transduced with a CD19-targeting CAR and were CRISPR edited to ablate SYK or ZAP70.

However, how exactly the PT invades the receptive synergid is unknown as the spatial relationship between these two cells is unclear. To better understand this process we performed 3D live imaging of PT reception in Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon arrival at the filiform apparatus (FA), a region rich in membrane folds at the micropylar pole of the synergids, the PT gradually deforms the FA before it rapidly grows into the receptive synergid. Upon penetration, the membrane of the receptive synergid invaginates and envelopes the PT. We termed this newly discovered structure the peri-tubular membrane (PRM). We show that, in feronia mutants disrupting PT reception, the PT still enters the receptive synergid, forming a normal PRM. This results in extensive invagination of the synergid membrane without sperm release. We show that PRM formation is associated with a cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) spike of high amplitude in the PT and flooding of [Ca2+]cyt in the synergids. In PTs lacking AUTOINHIBITED Ca2+ ATPASE9 activity, PTs have lower amplitude [Ca2+]cyt spiking and the PTs frequently fail to penetrate the synergid. Our findings suggest that synergid penetration and the non-cell autonomous control of PT rupture are distinct regulated processes required for fertilization in flowering plants.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

However, recent discoveries have revealed that a significant burden of disease heritability in common autoinflammatory disorders and coronary artery disease is mediated through genetic variation modifying post-transcriptional modification of RNA through adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. This common RNA modification is catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, where ADAR1 edits specific immunogenic double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to prevent activation of the double strand RNA (dsRNA) sensor MDA5 (IFIH1) and stimulation of an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) response. Multiple lines of human genetic data indicate impaired RNA editing and increased dsRNA sensing to be an important mechanism of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Here, we provide a crucial link between observations in human genetics and mechanistic cell biology leading to progression of CAD. Through analysis of human atherosclerotic plaque, we implicate the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) to have a unique requirement for RNA editing, and that ISG induction occurs in SMC phenotypic modulation, implicating MDA5 activation. Through culture of human coronary artery SMCs, generation of a conditional SMC specific Adar1 deletion mouse model on a pro-atherosclerosis background, and with incorporation of single cell RNA sequencing cellular profiling, we further show that Adar1 controls SMC phenotypic state, is required to maintain vascular integrity, and controls progression of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. Through this work, we describe a fundamental mechanism of CAD, where cell type and context specific RNA editing and sensing of dsRNA mediates disease progression, bridging our understanding of human genetics and disease causality.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Here, we employ single-molecule tracking in living yeast to assess the physiological kinetics of over 50 representative proteins encompassing all three RNAP machineries. Components of RNAPI and RNAPIII pre-initiation complexes (PICs) engage in long-lived interactions on chromatin, reflecting their roles for constitutive rRNA and tRNA synthesis, in contrast to the transient RNAPII PIC.

Strikingly, many elongation factors, previously thought to travel processively with RNAPII, display transient residence times, suggesting highly dynamic interactions rather than constant association. Systematic screening of RNAPII-associated factors shows that truncation of RNAPII-CTD substantially reduces U1 snRNP residence time and decreases intron retention in ribosomal protein genes, providing insights into how CTD length influences co-transcriptional splicing.

However, the early SC injury response preceding the repair state remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Sarm1, a key regulator of axon degeneration, is expressed in SCs and has a critical role in the early SC injury response. Leveraging the fact that Sarm1 deletion impairs the SC transition to the repair state, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptional responses of wild-type and Sarm1 knockout SCs 24 hours after nerve injury. Remarkably, Sarm1-deficient SCs, unlike wild-type SCs, showed increased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle. These findings were functionally validated, revealing that Sarm1 knockout SCs displayed increased mitochondrial respiration in response to injury. Intriguingly, Sarm1 knockout SCs also exhibited enhanced axon protection compared to wild-type SCs in an in vitro model of axon degeneration. We propose that Sarm1 gates the transition of SCs from a protective, oxidative phosphorylation-dependent state (which we term Protection Associated Schwann Cells or PASCs) to a glycolytic, pro-regenerative repair phenotype after injury. Our findings challenge the prevailing view of Sarm1 as an exclusively axon-autonomous regulator of degeneration and reveal a paradigm shift in understanding the role of Sarm1 in the SC injury response, with broad implications for the treatment of peripheral neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Some photosynthetic cyanobacteria can acclimate to growth in longer wavelength light by replacing five chlorophylls for long wavelength pigments in specific locations, including one in the reaction center (RC). However, the exact location and the nature of this long wavelength pigment still remain uncertain. Here we have addressed the color-tuning mechanism of the far-red light PSII (FRL-PSII) by excited state calculations at both the ab initio correlated (ADC2) and linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) levels in combination with large-scale hybrid quantum/classical (QM/MM) simulations and atomistic molecular dynamics. We show that substitution of a single chlorophyll pigment (ChlD1) at the RC by chlorophyll d leads to a spectral shift beyond the far-red light limit, as a result of the protein electrostatic, polarization and electronic coupling effects that reproduce key structural and spectroscopic observations. Pigment substitution at the ChlD1 site further results in a low site energy within the RC that could function as a sink for the excitation energy and initiate the primary charge separation reaction, driving the water oxidation. Our findings provide a basis for understanding color-tuning mechanisms and bioenergetic principles of oxygenic photosynthesis at the far-red light limit.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

The specific tissue factors governing the persistence and continuous differentiation of these cells remain undefined but could represent attractive therapeutic targets. In a model of chronic CNS autoimmunity, we find that oligodendrocyte-derived interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin, is key for locally regulating the pathogenicity of self-reactive CD8+ T cells. The selective ablation of IL-33 from neo-self-antigen-expressing oligodendrocytes mitigates CNS disease. In this context, fewer self-reactive CD8+ T cells persist in the inflamed CNS, and the remaining cells are largely locked into a stem-like precursor program, failing to form TCF-1low effector progeny. Importantly, interventional IL-33 blockade by locally administered somatic gene therapy reduces T cell infiltrates and improves the disease course. Our study identifies oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 as a druggable tissue factor regulating the differentiation and survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cell in the inflamed CNS.

However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neuron's anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Immediately, it has potential as a strategy for in-vivo electrode localization.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

This has permitted the early detection of outbreaks but has been insufficient for single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-level analysis due to lower read accuracy than Illumina sequencing. This study aimed to determine whether Haplotype-aware ERRor cOrrection (HERRO) of ONT data could permit high-resolution comparison of outbreak isolates. Methods: We used ONT simplex reads from isolates involved in a recent outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in our neonatal unit. The raw sequence data were re-basecalled and adapter-trimmed using Dorado v0.7.0. The simplex reads then underwent HERRO correction. The resulting genome assemblies and phylogenies were compared with previous analyses (using Dorado v0.3.4, no HERRO correction and data generated by Illumina sequencing). Results: Five of nine outbreak isolates were included in the analysis. The remaining four isolates had insufficient read lengths (N50 values <10,000 bp) and did not provide complete chromosome coverage after HERRO correction. The average chromosome sequencing depth for nanopore data was 147 x (range: 44&-220x) with an average read N50 of 12,215 bp (interquartile range (IQR): 11,439-12,711 bp). The median pairwise SNV distance between outbreak isolates from the original investigation was 51 SNVs (range: 40-68), which decreased to 3 SNVs (range: 1-15) with HERRO correction. Illumina sequencing generated a median SNV distance of 2 (range: 0-13). The resulting standalone ONT HERRO-corrected phylogeny was almost indistinguishable from the standalone Illumina-generated phylogeny. Conclusions: The addition of HERRO correction meant isolates from this MRSA outbreak could be resolved to a level on par with Illumina sequencing. ONT data following HERRO correction represents a viable standalone option for high-resolution genomic analysis of hospital outbreaks, provided sufficient read lengths can be generated.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Yet the dynamics of accessory genome evolution are very poorly understood, in contrast to the core genome where diversification is readily described by mutations and homologous recombination. Here, we tackle this problem for the case of very closely related genomes. We comprehensively describe genome evolution within n=222 genomes of E. coli ST131, which likely shared a common ancestor around one hundred years ago. After removing putative recombinant diversity, the total length of the phylogeny is 6000 core genome mutations. Within this diversity, we find 22 modifications to core genome synteny and estimate around 2000 structural changes within the accessory genome, i.e. one structural change for every 3 core genome mutations. 63% of loci with structural diversity could be resolved into individual gain and loss events with ten-fold more gains than losses, demonstrating a dominance of gains due to insertion sequences and prophage integration. Our results suggest the majority of synteny changes and insertions in bacterial genomes are likely deleterious and only persist for a short time before being removed by purifying selection.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.

Author summaryAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) play a critical role in the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses. Adaptive changes in AIVs enable them to infect mammalian species by altering viral interactions with host-specific factors, and one well-known example is the PB2-E627K mutation. Fortunately, this mutation is sporadic and rare in AIVs, usually occurring after infecting humans, and AIVs with PB2-627E, which is prevalent in poultry, cannot easily infect humans. However, if an AIV manages to overcome this species barrier, the risk of a pandemic originating from an AIV will significantly increase. In our study, we identified a dual adaptive variant called PB2-627V that combines avian-like properties of PB2-627E and human-like properties of PB2-627K. This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function. The mutation exhibited good fitness in both birds and humans, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. The PB2-627V polymorphism has been found in birds, humans, and mammals worldwide across more than ten AIV subtypes. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, we recommend considering PB2-627V as a new molecular marker to assess the pandemic potential of AIVs.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

However, how these three structures work together is not fully understood. Recently, it has been suggested that reinforcement learning may be implemented not only in the basal ganglia but also in the cerebellum, as the activity of cerebellar climbing fibers represents reward prediction error. If the same learning mechanism via reward prediction error occurs simultaneously in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, it remains unclear how these two regions co-function. Here, we recorded neuronal activity in the output of cerebellum and basal ganglia, the cerebellar nuclei and substantia nigra pars reticulata, respectively, from ChR2 transgenic rats with high-density Neuropixels probes while optogenetically stimulating the cerebral cortex point-by-point. The temporal response patterns could be categorized into two classes in both cerebellar nuclei and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Among them, the fast excitatory response of the cerebellar nuclei due to the input of mossy fibers and the inhibitory response of the substantia nigra pars reticulata via the direct pathway were synchronized. This coincidence, reproduced in a spiking network simulation based on connectome data, was expected to synchronously activate the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. To further investigate the significance of this synchronous positive feedback, we constructed a reservoir model that mimics the time course of the activity dynamics of cerebral cortex and temporal responses of cerebellar nuclei and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Plasticity of both parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cell and corticostriatal synapses onto the striatal neurons of the direct pathway was essential for successful learning of a reinforcement learning task. Notably, learning was inhibited when the timing of the cerebellar or basal ganglia output was delayed from the real data by 10 ms; the larger this delay, the slower the learning rate. This necessary temporal precision was observed only when the cerebral cortex operated in the {beta}-to-{gamma} frequency range. These results indicate that coordinated output of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, with input from the cerebral cortex in a narrow frequency band, facilitates brain-wide synergistic reinforcement learning. Thus, our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of the interactions among the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Our solutions leverage on the intrinsic repetitiveness of the color sets when indexing large collections of related genomes. Hence, the described algorithms factorize the color sets into patterns that repeat across the entire collection and represent these patterns once, instead of redundantly replicating their representation as would happen if the sets were encoded as atomic lists of integers. Experimental results across a range of datasets and query workloads show that these representations substantially improve over the space effectiveness of the best previous solutions (sometimes, even dramatically, yielding indexes that are smaller by an order of magnitude). Despite the space reduction, these indexes only moderately impact the efficiency of the queries compared to the fastest indexes.

Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range transport between the Golgi, endosomes and plasma membrane. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular transport machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs. Our findings reveal two functionally different classes of ARF1 compartments, each decorated by a different combination of APs. Perinuclear ARF1 compartments facilitate Golgi export of secretory cargo, while peripheral ARF1 compartments are involved in endocytic recycling downstream of early endosomes. Contrary to the classical model of long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe that ARF1 compartments shed ARF1 and mature into recycling endosomes. This maturation process is impaired in the absence of AP-1 and results in trafficking defects. Collectively, these data highlight a crucial role for ARF1 compartments in post-Golgi sorting.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802307

Depression is associated with immunological and metabolic alterations, but immunometabolic characteristics of developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms remain unclear. Using depressive symptoms scores measured on 10 occasions between ages 10 and 25 years in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n=7302), we identified four distinct trajectories: low-stable (70% of the sample), adolescent-limited (13%), adulthood-onset (10%) and adolescent-persistent (7%). We examined associations of these trajectories with: i) anthropometric, cardiometabolic and psychiatric phenotypes using multivariable regression (n=1709-3410); ii) 67 blood immunological proteins and 57 metabolomic features using empirical Bayes moderated linear models (n=2059 and n=2240 respectively); and iii) 28 blood cell counts and biochemical measures using multivariable regression (n=2256). Relative to the low-stable group, risk of depression and anxiety in adulthood was higher for all other groups, especially in the adolescent-persistent (ORdepression=22.80, 95% CI 15.25-34.37; ORGAD=19.32, 95% CI 12.86-29.22) and adulthood-onset (ORdepression=7.68, 95% CI 5.31-11.17; ORGAD=5.39, 95% CI 3.65-7.94) groups. The three depression-related trajectories vary in their immunometabolic profile, with evidence of little or no alterations in the adolescent-limited group. The adulthood-onset group shows widespread classical immunometabolic changes (e.g., increased immune cell counts and insulin resistance), while the adolescent-persistent group is characterised by higher BMI both in childhood and adulthood with few other immunometabolic changes. These findings point to distinct mechanisms and intervention opportunities for adverse cardiometabolic profile in different groups of young people with depression.","NA","medrxiv",1720994802307

Here we describe NanoTag, a novel method derived from CUT&Tag that is IgG-free and uses a nanobody to profile DNA-protein interactions. NanoTag is based on an anti-GFP nanobody-Tn5 transposase fusion that allows mapping GFP-tagged proteins associated with chromatin in a fast and cost-effective manner. We demonstrate the utility of NanoTag by profiling the histone mark H3K4me3 via its binding partner TATA box-binding protein-associated factor 3 (TAF3) and the transcription factors Nanog and CTCF in mouse embryonic stem cells expressing GFP-tagged targets. For the targets examined, NanoTag data shows high correlation to CUT&Tag data and displays a similarly high signal-to-noise ratio.

Likelihood-free approaches optimize a least square objective and have gained popularity in recent years due to their scalability.

There is emerging evidence that the chronic MSK pain and associated symptoms in PCS have similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS). This study aimed to characterise PCS related new-onset chronic MSK pain and its overlap with Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS).

MethodsPatients with new-onset chronic MSK pain following COVID-19 infection were enrolled and the nature of pain and associated symptoms captured using the C19-YRS (Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale). FMS assessment was conducted as part of standard clinical examination using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010 criteria. Diagnosis of FMS was made when they meet the standard criteria of (1) Widespread Pain Index (WPI) [&ge;] 7 and Symptoms Severity (SS) score [&ge;] 5, or WPI is 3-6 and SS score [&ge;] 9, (2) symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months, and (3) the patient does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the symptoms.

ResultsEighteen patients, twelve of whom were female, with an average age of 49.6 (SD 11.8) years and a Body Mass Index of 31.7 (SD 8.6) were enrolled. The average duration of symptoms from COVID-19 infection to assessment was 27.9 (SD 6.97) months. The new-onset chronic pain was widespread, primarily manifesting as muscle pain. Thirteen (72.2%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for FMS, with an average WPI score of 8.8 and an average SS score of 8.2, indicating a high level of pain and significant adverse impact on their quality of life.

ConclusionThe study found that 72.2% of the patients with new-onset chronic MSK pain following COVID-19 infection met the criteria for FMS. These findings support the hypothesis that FMS may develop as a long-term sequela of a viral infection, underscoring the need for further research into post-viral long-term conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1720994802308

While the evolution of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to avoid humoral immunity is well characterized, relatively little is known about the evolution of innate immune antagonism phenotypes in these viruses. Numerous studies have established that only a small subset of infected cells is responsible for initiating the type I and type III interferon (IFN) response during IAV infection, emphasizing the importance of single cell studies to accurately characterize the IFN response during infection. We developed a flow cytometry-based method to examine transcriptional changes in IFN and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression at the single cell level. We observed that NS segments derived from seasonal H3N2 viruses are more efficient at antagonizing IFN signaling but less effective at suppressing IFN induction, compared to the pdm2009 H1N1 lineage. We compared a collection of NS segments spanning the natural history of the current seasonal IAV lineages and demonstrate long periods of stability in IFN antagonism potential, punctuated by occasional phenotypic shifts. Altogether, our data reveal significant differences in how seasonal and pandemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses antagonize the human IFN response at the single cell level.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

They can learn to vocalize on command and the activity of single neurons from the crow's associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal skilled behaviors. However, it remains unknown if specific anatomical adaptations that directly link the crow NCL to any of the nuclei of the crow's 'song system' exist. To address this issue, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods (Nissl-, myelin-, and anti tyrosine hydroxylase) to characterize the connectivity of the crow's NCL in relation to its song system nuclei. We found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to and engulfing the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), which is the telencephalic motor output of the song system. Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum surrounding the basal ganglia song nucleus 'area X'. Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections - MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC - run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a 'general motor system' that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Here, we report that the ChP base region harbors unique fibroblasts that cluster together, are connected by tight junctions and seal the ChP stroma from brain and CSF, thereby forming ChP base barrier cells (ChP BBCs). ChP BBCs are derived from meningeal mesenchymal precursors, arrive early during embryonic development, are maintained throughout life and are conserved across species. Moreover, we provide transcriptional profiles and key markers to label ChP BBCs and observe a striking transcriptional similarity with meningeal arachnoid barrier cells (ABCs). Finally, we provide evidence that this fibroblast cluster functions as a barrier to control communication between CSF and the ChP stroma and between the latter and the brain parenchyma. Moreover, loss of barrier function was observed during an inflammatory insult. Altogether, we have identified a novel barrier that provides functional compartmentalization of ChP, brain and CSF.

The choroid plexus (ChP) hangs in the brain ventricles and is composed of an epithelial cell layer which produces the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and forms the blood-CSF barrier. The ChP epithelial cells are continuous with the ependymal cells lining the ventricle wall. At this base region, we identified and characterized a novel subtype of fibroblasts coined the ChP base barrier cells (BBCs). ChP BBCs express tight junctions (TJs), cluster together and seal the ChP stroma from CSF and brain parenchyma. The subarachnoid space (SAS) CSF penetrates deep into choroid plexus invaginations where it is halted by ChP BBCs.

Amyloid-beta is a 40-42 amino acid peptide produced by the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by a series of membrane-bound proteases. APP is a type-I transmembrane protein and thus its trafficking to encounter the proteases represents a rate-limiting step in the progression of AD. Although there has been a focused research effort to understand APP processing, its trafficking itinerary and machinery is incompletely understood. To address this we have performed an unbiased interaction screen for interactors of the cytosolic tail of APP. We identified previously characterised APP binders, as well as novel interactors. We have mapped the binding of APP to multiple new machineries, including RABGAP1. We have demonstrated that RABGAP1 partially colocalises with APP and directly interacts with a YENPTY motif in the APP cytosolic tail. Depletion or overexpression of RABGAP1 caused mistrafficking and misprocessing of endogenous APP in both human and rodent neurons. Interestingly, this effect was dependent on the GAP activity of RABGAP1, demonstrating that RABGAP1 affects the trafficking of APP by modulating the RAB activity on endosomal subdomains. This novel trafficking mechanism has implications for other NPXY cargoes and also presents a possible therapeutic avenue to explore.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies identified heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. However, proof of functional differences between such subpopulations is lacking. To identify functionally distinct senescent cell subpopulations, we employed high-content image analysis to measure senescence marker expression in primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. We found that G2-arrested senescent cells feature higher senescence marker expression than G1-arrested senescent cells. To investigate functional differences, we compared IL-6 secretion and response to ABT263 senolytic treatment in G1 and G2 senescent cells. We determined that G2-arrested senescent cells secrete more IL-6 and are more sensitive to ABT263 than G1-arrested cells. We hypothesize that cell cycle dependent DNA content is a key contributor to the heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. This study demonstrates the existence of functionally distinct senescent subpopulations even in culture. This data provides the first evidence of selective cell response to senolytic treatment among senescent cell subpopulations. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering the senescent cell heterogeneity in the development of future senolytic therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

However, some trypanosome lineages have simplified their lifecycle by escaping dependence on tsetse allowing an expanded geographical range, with direct transmission between hosts achieved via biting flies and vampire bats (Trypanosoma brucei evansi, causing the disease ""surra"") or through sexual transmission (Trypanosoma brucei equiperdum, causing ""dourine""). Concomitantly, stumpy formation is reduced or lost, and the isolates are described as monomorphic, with infections spread widely in Africa, Asia, South America and parts of Europe. Here, using genomic analysis of distinct field isolates, we identified and functionally confirmed molecular changes that accompany the loss of the stumpy transmission stage in monomorphic clades. Further, using laboratory selection for resistance to the parasites quorum-sensing signal, we identified reversible steps in the initial development of monomorphism.

CODANIN-1 negatively regulates the function of ASF1. However, the molecular mechanism by which CODANIN-1 inhibits ASF1-mediated histone supply remains elusive. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a human CODANIN-1_ASF1A_CDIN1 complex at 3.56 [A] resolution. The structure reveals that CODANIN-1 forms a dimer and utilizes a histone H3 mimic helix (HMH) to interact with the histone binding surface of ASF1. This feature confers on CODANIN-1 an ability to sequester ASF1 and inhibit the formation of the ASF1-H3-H4 complex, essential for histone nuclear import and nucleosome assembly.

Two major methodologies exist to study these fluctuations: an objective approach that identifies ""in-the-zone"" states of consistent response times (RTs) and ""out-of-the-zone"" states of erratic RTs and a subjective approach that asks participants whether they are on-task or mind wandering. Although both approaches effectively predict attentional lapses, it remains unclear whether they capture the same or distinct attentional fluctuations. We combined both approaches within a single sustained attention task requiring frequent responses and response inhibition to rare targets to explore their consistency (N=40). Behaviorally, both objective out-of-the-zone and subjective mind-wandering states were associated with more attentional lapses. However, the percentage of time spent out-of-the-zone did not differ between on-task and mind-wandering periods and both objective and subjective states independently predicted error-proneness, suggesting that the two methods do not capture the same type of attention fluctuations. Whereas attentional preparation before correct inhibitions was greater during out-of-the-zone compared to in-the-zone periods, preparation did not differ by subjective state. In contrast, post-error slowing differed by both objective and subjective states, but in opposite directions: slowing was observed when participants were objectively out-of-the-zone or subjectively on-task. Overall, our results provide evidence that objective and subjective approaches capture distinct attention fluctuations during sustained attention tasks. Integrating both objective and subjective measures is crucial for fully understanding the mechanisms underlying our ability to remain focused.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in ten laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

We have recently shown associations for CHIP with acute kidney injury and with kidney function decline in the general population, with stronger associations for CHIP driven by mutations in genes other than DNMT3A (non-DNMT3A CHIP). Longitudinal kidney function endpoints in individuals with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CHIP have been examined in two previous studies, which reported conflicting findings and were limited by small sample sizes.

MethodsIn this study, we examined the prospective associations between CHIP and CKD progression events in four cohorts of CKD patients (total N = 5,772). The primary outcome was a composite of 50% kidney function decline or kidney failure. The slope of eGFR decline was examined as a secondary outcome. Mendelian randomization techniques were then used to investigate potential causal effects of CHIP on eGFR decline. Finally, kidney function was assessed in adenine-fed CKD model mice having received a bone marrow transplant recapitulatingTet2-CHIP compared to controls transplanted wild-type bone marrow.

ResultsAcross all cohorts, the average age was 66.4 years, the average baseline eGFR was 42.6 ml/min/1.73m2, and 24% had CHIP. Upon meta-analysis, non-DNMT3A CHIP was associated with a 59% higher relative risk of incident CKD progression (HR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02-2.47). This association was more pronounced among individuals with diabetes (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.62) and with baseline eGFR [&ge;] 30 ml/min/1.73m (HR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11-2.90). Additionally, the annualized slope of eGFR decline was steeper among non-DNMT3A CHIP carriers, relative to non-carriers ({beta} -0.61 {+/-} 0.31 ml/min/1.73m2, p = 0.04). Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a causal role for CHIP in eGFR decline among individuals with diabetes. In a dietary adenine mouse model of CKD, Tet2-CHIP was associated with lower GFR as well as greater kidney inflammation, tubular injury, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

ConclusionNon-DNMT3A CHIP is a potentially targetable novel risk factor for CKD progression.","NA","medrxiv",1720994802308

CpE binds selectively to membrane protein receptors called claudins on the apical surfaces of small intestinal epithelium. Claudins normally construct tight junctions that regulate epithelial paracellular transport but are hijacked from doing so by CpE and are instead led to form claudin/CpE small complexes. Small complexes are building blocks for assembling oligomeric {beta}-barrel pores that penetrate the plasma membrane and induce gut cytotoxicity. Here we present structures of CpE in complexes with its native claudin receptor in humans, claudin-4, at 4.0 and 2.8 [A] using cryogenic electron microscopy. The structures reveal the overall architecture of the small complex, that the small complex can be kinetically trapped, and resolve its key features; like the residues used in claudin/CpE complex binding, the orientation of CpE relative to the membrane, and CpE-induced structural changes to claudin-4. Further, the structures allude to the biophysical procession from small complex to cytotoxic {beta}-barrel pore used by CpE during pathogenesis and the role of trypsin in this process. In full, this work elucidates the structure and mechanism of claudin-bound CpE pore assembly and provides strategies to obstruct its formation to treat CpE-induced gastrointestinal diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Protracted withdrawal is characterized by negative affective behaviors such as heightened anxiety, irritability, dysphoria, and anhedonia, which pose a significant risk factor for relapse. While the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and mu-opioid recep-tors (MORs) are critical for opioid reinforcement, the specific contributions of VTA-MOR neurons in mediating protracted withdrawal-induced negative affect is not fully understood. In our study, we elucidate the role of VTA-MOR neurons in mediating negative affect and altered brain-wide neuronal activities following opioid exposure and withdrawal in male and female mice. Utilizing a chronic oral mor-phine administration model, we observe increased social deficit, anxiety-related, and despair-like behaviors during protracted with-drawal. VTA-MOR neurons show heightened neuronal FOS activation at the onset of withdrawal and connect to an array of brain regions that mediate reward and affective processes. Viral re-expression of MORs selectively within the VTA of MOR knockout mice demon-strates that the disrupted social interaction observed during protracted withdrawal is facilitated by this neural population, without affect-ing other protracted withdrawal behaviors. Lastly, VTA-MORs contribute to heightened neuronal FOS activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to an acute morphine challenge, suggesting their unique role in modulating ACC-specific neuronal activity. These findings identify VTA-MOR neurons as critical modulators of low sociability during protracted withdrawal and highlight their potential as a mechanistic target to alleviate negative affective behaviors associated with opioid withdrawal.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Previously, we identified the nuclear envelope (NE) protein Msc1 as important for late-M DSB repair. Here, we report that Msc1 faces the NE lumen, and its depletion leads to DSB-independent over-compartmentalization of the nucleus, which hampers approximation of sister loci after DSB. Depletion of Msc1 also leads to nuclear pore complex mislocation, a phenotype shared by the highly conserved NE healing complex ESCRT-III. Critically, we show that both Msc1 and ESCRT-III also ensure DSB repair in G2/M, and that there is synergism between Msc1 and the ESCRT-III subunit Snf7.

It may be targeted in inflammatory diseases and provides rationale to consider the immunological state of patients with mitochondrial disease.

Lipid metabolism is fundamental to CD4+ T cell metabolism yet remains poorly understood across subsets. Therefore, we performed targeted in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify lipid-associated genes essential for T cell subset functions. These screens established mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) genes Mecr, Mcat and Oxsm as highly impactful. Of these, the inborn error of metabolism gene Mecr was most dynamically regulated. Effector and memory T cells were reduced in Mecrfl/fl; Cd4cre mice, and MECR was required for activated CD4+ T cells to efficiently proliferate, differentiate, and survive. Mecr-deficient T cells also had decreased mitochondrial respiration, reduced TCA intermediates, and accumulated intracellular iron, which contributed to cell death and sensitivity to ferroptosis. Importantly, Mecr-deficient T cells exhibited fitness disadvantages in inflammatory, tumor, and infection models. mtFAS and MECR thus play important roles in activated T cells and may provide targets to modulate immune functions in inflammatory diseases. The immunological state of MECR- and mtFAS-deficient patients may also be compromised.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

On the other hand, many preclinical self-administration and choice experiments employ fixed unit doses and mandatory timeouts after doses (known as discrete dimension procedures). These restrictions fail to consider the distinct pharmacokinetic properties of heroin and cocaine, leading to uniform and comparable behaviors (including drug-taking patterns). This uniformity contrasts sharply with the significantly different ways humans use heroin and cocaine, which are characterized by highly individualized drug use behaviors. Here, we introduce a no-timeout procedure that overcomes this limitation (continuous dimension procedure).

We analyzed the heroin and cocaine taking- and seeking-patterns and estimated drug-brain levels in the presence or absence of timeout between drug injections. We further assessed how absence of timeout and the availability of drug or social peer (access time to the two rewards) affect drug preference. Removing the timeout had a profound effect on pattern of heroin taking and seeking, promoting the emergence of burst-like drug intake and social withdrawal as revealed by a discrete choice procedure. On the other hand, timeout removal had a lesser impact on cocaine taking and seeking and did not impact social preference. By removing timeout during self-administration and increasing the access time during choice resulted in a self-administration procedure that more closely mimic human heroin intake, offering a platform to identify novel medications.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Using a spatial memory task in rats, we simultaneously recorded ensembles from hippocampal CA1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to address this question. We found that task behaviors best aligned with low-dimensional, shared subspaces between these regions, rather than local activity in either region. Critically, both network oscillations and speed modulated the structure and performance of this communication subspace. Contrary to expectations, theta coherence did not better predict CA1-PFC shared activity, while theta power played a more significant role. To understand the communication space, we visualized shared CA1-PFC communication geometry using manifold techniques and found ring-like structures. We hypothesize that these shared activity manifolds are utilized to mediate the task behavior. These findings suggest that memory-guided behaviors are driven by shared CA1-PFC interactions that are dynamically modulated by oscillatory states, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between rhythms and behaviorally relevant neural communication.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Here, we discover an orphan antitoxin counter-defense element in T4-like phages that can overcome the bacterial toxin-antitoxin phage defense system, DarTG1. The DarT1 toxin, an ADP-ribosyltransferase, modifies phage DNA to prevent replication while its cognate antitoxin, DarG1, is an ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase that reverses these modifications in uninfected bacteria. The orphan phage DarG1-like protein, which we term anti-DarT factor NADAR (AdfN), removes ADP-ribose modifications from phage DNA during infection thereby enabling replication in DarTG1-containing bacteria. AdfN, like DarG1, is in the NADAR superfamily of ADP-ribosylglycohydrolases found across domains of life. We find divergent NADAR proteins in unrelated phages that likewise exhibit anti-DarTG1 activity, underscoring the importance of ADP-ribosylation in bacterial-phage interactions, and revealing the function of a substantial subset of the NADAR superfamily.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

However, the effects of long-term exposure to altered gravity conditions, including microgravity, on most of the biological processes of a plants life cycle remain largely unexplored. Given the limited opportunities for space experiments, it is crucial to conduct ground-based experiments, such as hypergravity experiments. To investigate the longer-term effects of hypergravity, we have developed and utilized a custom-built hypergravity cultivation system using a centrifuge equipped with lighting, enabling the continuous growth of seed plants under hypergravity conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of 10 g hypergravity on the biomass of the shoot system (stems and rosette leaves) and the root system of vascular plants for the first time, covering the entire cultivation period from germination to 40 days. Our results showed that the dry mass of the stem per unit length was significantly higher under 10 g compared to the 1 g control, indicating a typical gravity resistance response of the stem. Moreover, the total dry mass of the stems, rosette leaves, and roots was higher under 10 g hypergravity compared to the 1 g control, suggesting an increase in biomass at the individual plant level. We also observed that the leaf mass per area of the rosette leaf was higher under hypergravity compared to the 1 g control, indicating enhanced photosynthesis rates in Arabidopsis and resulting in increased biomass of individual plants. In terms of biomass allocation, both root-shoot ratio and root mass fraction were significantly higher under hypergravity conditions compared to the 1 g control. Furthermore, we measured the content of mineral elements (Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, Zn) in the roots and rosette leaves using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Despite the increase in dry mass of the root system, we found no significant differences in the content of any of the ions analyzed between 10 g and 1 g conditions, indicating that mineral nutrient uptake homeostasis is maintained even under hypergravity conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Nevertheless, microgravity has a significant impact on humans. Immune and red blood cells utilize hematic or lymphatic streams (bio-fluid) as their primary mode of transport, and these streams have been identified as a significant concern under microgravity. This study aims to quantitatively address the puzzle of how cells are influenced by gravity when they are suspended in bio-fluid. The Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) approach was used to model blood and the cell by applying gravity as an external force along the vertical axis and varied from 0g to 2g during parameter sweeps. It was observed that the cell undergoes shape change and spatially aligns under the influence of gravity, and this was quantified with metrics such as Elongation and Deformation indices, pitch angle, and normalized center of mass. The Elongation Index and the normalized center of mass declined linearly with the applied gravity. Correlation analysis showed a strong correlation between applied gravity and the aforementioned variables. Forces exerted on the solid, specifically drag, shear stress, and solid forces, declined in magnitude as the gravitational force exerted on the cell was increased. Further analysis showed that increasing gravity affected the cells velocity, leading to extended proximity near the wall and increased viscous interaction with the surrounding fluid particles, triggering a shape change. This study marks a significant step in understanding gravitys effects on blood cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

The huge number of scientific articles with the term arousal (~50.000) highlights the importance of the concept but also explains why such a vast literature has never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. We then ask whether domain-general arousal exists, and run meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature to reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we find that activity in dysgranular insular area 7, the region with the highest convergence across varieties of arousal is also specific to arousal. Our results show that arousal corresponds to a construct at least partially shared across different domains of neuroscience and identify the domain-general cortical arousal network. Novel taxonomies of arousal reconciling seemingly opposing views on what arousal is should thus include domain-general arousal as a central component.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Fast subsecond fluctuations in neuronal population responses dominate the temporal dynamics of neural circuits. Traditional approaches have treated this activity as ""noise"" that can be averaged away by taking the mean spiking rate over wide time bins or over multiple trial repetitions, but this ignores much of the temporal dynamics that naturally occur in neural systems. We find that subsecond flares of increased population activity are layer- and cell-type specific, and large-scale computational modelling suggests they may serve as an inter-areal gating mechanism. Moreover, we find that most of the neural variability is restricted to a population-gain axis. This observation explains why neural systems can function in the presence of excessive variability: population-level spiking dynamics generate invariance to the majority of neural noise.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Here, we focus on B vitamin exchange in coastal marine bacterial communities that degrade particulate organic matter and find that natural seawater communities are vitamin limited. While almost a third of bacterial isolates from these communities are B vitamin auxotrophs, the pioneering degraders that first arrive on particles are vitamin producers that likely support auxotrophs through cross-feeding. However, combining experiments and a resource-explicit model, we show that auxotroph growth is often not restored by coculture with vitamin producers, but rather requires lysis and subsequent vitamin recycling.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.

They form superhelical structures around which DNA is wrapped. Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1720994802308
